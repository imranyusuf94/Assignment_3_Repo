    "According to ABS (2021), housing continues to be Australia's largest asset class, worth approximately $7.7 trillion, and yet, the study of real estate sentiment in Australia has been profoundly under-researched to date (Nanda & Heinig, 2018). Conversely, current literature reviews have established a strong connection between investor sentiment and stock returns in general, which would in turn suggests that there is also some degree of correlation between real estate sentiment and the strength of the property market as well (Bisen, 2020; Bharathi & Geetha, 2017; Corredor, Ferrer & Santamaria, 2011). In view of these findings, it was clear that there existed an opportunity to exploit this underutilisation in real estate sentiment within Australia to gain a competitive edge in estimating where and when to invest in Australian housing. As such, this Project aims to autonomously estimate the strength of the property market across all states and territories in Australia, as a function of time, by relying on trusted Australian news sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project posed several distinct challenges, including:\n",
    "- **Identifying the right news sources:** only trusted Australian news sources were considered, which meant first examining their machinery of care, transparency, expertise and agenda (Caulfield, 2017). Furthermore, only news sources which provided consent for web crawling their data were pursued in order to remain ethical. The combination of these two factors significantly limited the candidates of websites to consume.\n",
    "- **Extracting places from news articles:** it was deemed highly likely that multiple states and territories could be mentioned in any given news article, which was regarded as significant since there could be differing sentiments per article depending on the location being discussed. Hence, it was important to be able to separately identify all of the place entities within the corpus. This assumed that only one state or territory would be mentioned in any given sentence for every news article.\n",
    "- **Providing an autonomous solution:** the proposed solution needed to be able to automatically interact with a web browser, consume news article data from the chosen news sources and then make predictions as to the dominant sentiment of each state or territory without any human intervention.\n",
    "- **Resource limitations:** the proposed solution needed to be achieved without exceeding the 8GB GPU memory offered by the available resources. This ruled out state-of-the-art model solutions such as BERT, which required more than 16GB GPU memory for most fine-tuning experiments (Hui, 2019).\n",
