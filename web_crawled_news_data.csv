"Melbourne dwelling values have surpassed their earlier April 2020 peak by 0.2%, according to CoreLogic’s daily hedonic home value index.

Tim Lawless, CoreLogic’s Executive Research Director, says it had only been a matter of time before the recent strong capital gains in housing values led Australia’s second largest city to move to new record highs.  

“Reflecting what we saw in Sydney earlier this month, Melbourne dwelling values have now surpassed their previous peak to notch up a new record high. Following a decline of -6.1% through COVID-19, values have since grown by 6.7%, and are now sitting 0.2% above their recent high recorded by CoreLogic’s hedonic daily home value index on 6 April 2020.”

This brings Melbourne’s dwelling values to 13.8% above their recent low in mid-2019, and the median value for all dwellings to $736,478.

 

 

CoreLogic’s monthly hedonic home value index for March will be released on Thursday 1st April and will contain dwelling value updates for the rest of the country. For more information, visit www.corelogic.com.au.

"This edition of the Pain and Gain report analyses approximately 98,000 resales of residential property that took place in the three months to December 2020. The results show an increase in the profitability of Australian real estate, with 89.9% of transactions seeing a nominal gain for sellers.

Eliza Owen, Core Logic’s Head of Research said on the latest Pain and Gain report “As property values rose across each state and Territory through the December quarter, buoyed by a cash rate reduction through November, the value of profits also increased substantially. Total gains from resales in the December quarter rose to $31.9 billion, up from $24.8 billion in the previous quarter. Combined losses from resales also shrank from $1.2 billion to $1 billion from the September to December quarter.”

The results are particularly significant given the uplift in sales volumes in the 3 months to December, much of which was driven by an increase in transaction activity across Melbourne. Sales and listings increased remarkably across the city, as the economy emerged from the weakness associated with the extended lockdowns.

Key highlights – December 2020 Quarter

Profitability in Australian real estate rose in the December quarter, coinciding with a 2.3% uplift in dwelling values nationally. Total gains from resales in the December quarter rose to $31.9 billion, up from $24.8 billion in the previous quarter. Combined losses from resales also shrank from $1.2 billion to $1 billion from the September to December quarter.
The rate of profit making resales in the December quarter rose to 89.9%, up from 88.3% in the 3 months to June.
Profitability in Australian dwelling sales is above pre-COVID-19 levels, where the rate of profit making sales was 87.9% in the three months to February.
Across the capital city markets, Hobart had the highest incidence of profit making sales, at 97.2%. This is up from 96.7% in the September quarter.
The lowest incidence of profit making sales across the capital cities was across Darwin, where 51.4% of properties sold for a loss. The rate of loss making sales across Darwin was 48.6%, and although high, has fallen from 50.6% in the September quarter.
The higher incidence of profit making sales through the December quarter was off the back of increased sales volumes. CoreLogic estimates that sales volumes increased 23.6% through the December quarter on the three months to September, as well as December quarter sales volumes being 20.4% above the 5-year average.
Profitability across both houses and units rose across Australia in the December 2020 quarter. The portion of properties sold at a loss among houses fell from 9.3% in the three months to September to 7.3%, while the portion of loss making unit sales fell from 19.6% to 18.7%.
The rate of profit making house sales rose to 92.7%, which is highest level of profitability since the June quarter of 2018.
Over the December 2020 quarter, owner occupiers had a higher incidence of profit making sales than investors. At the national level, owner occupiers saw a profit on 92.2% of resales, compared with 84.9% among investors.
Over the December 2020 quarter, the median hold period of re-sale events across Australia was approximately 8.9 years. For profit making sales, the median hold period was 9.2 years, while loss making sales were typically held for 6.9 years.
The lowest typical hold period associated with a profit making sale was across regional Tasmanian units, where the median hold period on a profit-making sale was 6.7 years.
Over the December 2020 quarter, around 33.4% of sales across mining regions had re-sold at a loss, which is down from 37.0% reported in the previous quarter.
The December quarter saw largely positive results for real estate sellers across the coastal markets of Australia, following further increases across regional Australian property markets in the three months to December. 5 of the 9 regions measured saw a rate of profit making sales about 95% through the December quarter. These were Geelong (98.5%), the Mid North Coast (96.3%), the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie region (96.7%), the Richmond – Tweed region (also 96.7%) and the Sunshine Coast (96.3%).
Across Greater Melbourne, the rate of profit making sales increased significantly from 93.0% in the 3 months to September, to 94.3% over the 3 months to December. This reflected a turn in Melbourne dwelling values, which increased 1.5% as the Melbourne economy came out of lockdowns.

"New data suggests changes to mortgage lending rules in the near future are unlikely, despite rapidly rising home values. Recent data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) suggests that while the proportion of loan originations that could be ‘higher risk’ showed a slight increase through the December quarter, the regulator saw no evidence of a “material relaxation in lending standards”. 

Indicators of lending standards are being watched carefully. Borrowing for the purchase of residential property hit a record $28.8 billion in January 2021, up 34.8% from the decade average. This has also contributed to housing values reaching a new record high.

So far however, the December 2020 quarter has not shown any major deterioration in lending standards, suggesting there is no need for interventions in the form of tighter credit policies. The December 2020 quarter is of particular importance, because it marks a positive turn in Sydney and Melbourne dwelling values coming out of COVID-related restrictions. Select metrics from the publication are discussed below. 

The share of interest only loans as a portion of new home loans ticked up to 19.2%

The portion of new mortgages lent on interest only terms hit 19.2% in the December 2020 quarter, up from 18.5% in the previous quarter. 

This is not far from the 18.7% average seen over the past two years. It is also is well below the record high of 45.6%, which was recorded over the June 2015 quarter. However, it is worth noting there have been improvements to collection of banking statistics, and the historic series is not directly comparable with recent data. 

 

 

Interest only lending was noted as a potential risk to broader financial stability in the years to 2017. At that time, it was becoming more common for borrowers to originate their loans on interest only repayment terms, or refinance and extend their interest only term period. This was leading to a delay in the paying down of loan principals, at a time when house prices and household debt were rising. 

Interest only loan structures have generally been more popular among investors, who are eligible for tax deductions on their interest payments. Considering investors remain around record lows as a share of total lending, the risk to financial stability from interest only lending to this segment of the market remains low.  

A key area regulators are likely to be watching is the proportion of interest only lending to owner occupiers.  The number of interest only loans to owner occupiers increased by 32.5% over the September quarter and comprised a series high 45.7% of interest only loan originations.  A sustained lift in owner occupiers not paying down their loan principal, could place upwards pressure on household debt levels, creating stability risks when interest rates eventually rise.

Debt to income ratios of greater than, or equal to 6, hit a two year high

APRA has previously cautioned lenders on exposure to loan-to-income ratios, and debt-to-income ratios, exceeding 6.
The portion of new home loans originated on a loan-to-income ratio of greater than, or equal to 6 times reached 7.0% of loans over the December 2020 quarter. This is the highest across the series, which commences from March 2019. Loans originated with a debt-to-income ratio of 6 or more made up 17.2% of mortgages originated in the quarter, which was also a series high. APRA did not express concern around this metric in their report, arguing the share of debt to income lending was “within its historical average”.  

 

 

 

Increased demand across Sydney and Melbourne property markets, as is being seen at the moment, will test debt to income ratios. This is because the house price to income ratio across Sydney has averaged around 8.5 since 2013, and has averaged 7.5 across Melbourne since 2015.  As housing prices rise at a time when incomes are expected to remain relatively flat, there is the potential for both loan-to-income and debt-to-income ratios to lift further, which is likely to be seen as a riskier outcome by regulators.

The proportion of loans originating on high loan to value ratios (LVRs) also rose for owner occupiers and investors

The portion of new home loans originated on a loan to value ratio of 80% or more increased to 42.0% across all borrowers in the December 2020 quarter, up from 39.9% in the previous quarter to be the highest proportion on record. The jump was greater in the owner occupier space, where 45.7% of loans were originated on an LVR of greater than or equal to 80%, and 14.1% of loans were greater than or equal to 90%. 

 

 

The regulator argued this increase reflects greater participation of owner occupiers in the market, particularly first home buyers. First home buyers may be accessing housing through loan guarantors, or even the first home loan deposit scheme, which reduced the risk of low-deposit home loans. 

The latest data from APRA indicates there is no blow out of risk in mortgage lending, despite the recent surge in property prices across Australia. The publication follows a recent address from RBA governor Phillip Lowe, who reiterated the strategy of maintaining a low cash rate for years to come, which is likely to continue supporting housing demand. 

But a deterioration in lending standards can be mitigated, as we’ve witnessed before. This could be achieved be tightening serviceability assessment rates, loan sizes relative to incomes or debt (LTI or DTI ratios) or loan sizes relative to home valuations (LVR ratios). In a recent statement, the Council of Financial Regulators reiterated that while lending standards were generally being maintained at this stage, they have responses up their sleeves if lending conditions do become risky. 

While APRA’s December quarter statistics show a trend towards ‘riskier’ styles of lending, the magnitude is not likely to be large enough to trigger a regulatory response; but if this trend continues, or indeed accelerates, it becomes more likely we will see a regulatory intervention aimed at curbing financial stability risks related to the housing sector.

"CoreLogic today announced Sydney property values have recovered to be beyond their earlier 2017 peak.

Tim Lawless, CoreLogic’s Executive Research Director, says he’s not surprised that the recent strong capital gains in housing values have led another capital city to move to new record highs.  

“The recovery trend in Sydney following the -15.3% decline from July 2017 to May 2019 was interrupted by COVID-19, with housing values falling by -3.0% through the worst of the pandemic.

“Since housing values found a floor in October last year, Sydney home values have risen 5.7% to reach a new record high today. The fresh record high is great news for Sydney home owners, but highlights the challenges for non-home owners looking to participate in the housing market as values rise faster than incomes,” says Mr Lawless.

According to CoreLogic’s daily hedonic home value index, Melbourne dwelling values remain -1.3% below their pre-COVID high and Perth values are still -16.9% lower relative to the 2014 peak.

"Australian home values surged 2.1% higher in February; the largest month-on-month change in CoreLogic’s national home value index since August 2003.  Spurred on by a combination of record low mortgage rates, improving economic conditions, government incentives and low advertised supply levels, Australia’s housing market is in the midst of a broad-based boom.  

Housing values are rising across each of the capital city and rest of state regions, demonstrating the diverse nature of this housing upswing. 

According to CoreLogic’s research director, Tim Lawless, a synchronised growth phase like this hasn’t been seen in Australia for more than a decade.  

“The last time we saw a sustained period where every capital city and rest of state region was rising in value was mid-2009 through to early 2010, as post-GFC stimulus fueled buyer demand.”

Sydney and Melbourne were among the strongest performing markets, recording a 2.5% and 2.1% lift in home values over the month respectively, as Australia’s two largest cities caught up from weaker performance through 2020.  The quarterly trend however, is still favouring the smaller cities; Darwin housing values rose 5.5% over the past three months, Hobart values rose 4.8% and Perth was up 4.2%.  

“Whether this new found growth in Sydney and Melbourne can be sustained is unclear.  Both cities are still recording values below their earlier peaks, however at this current rate of appreciation it won’t be long before Australia’s two most expensive capital city markets are moving through new record highs.  With household incomes expected to remain subdued and stimulus winding down, it is likely affordability will once again become a challenge in these cities,” Mr Lawless said.

Regional markets (up +2.1% over the month) have continued to show a higher rate of capital gain relative to the capital cities (up +2.0%), however the performance gap has narrowed compared with the earlier phase of the growth cycle.  Regional areas generally recorded less of a decline in housing values through the worst of the COVID period last year, while also showing an earlier and stronger growth trend through the second half of last year.  This regional preference is reflected in the annual growth trend, where the combined regionals index is 9.4% higher while the combined capital city index is up a much smaller 2.6%. 

A housing market trend that has persisted through the COVID period to-date is the weaker performance of unit markets relative to detached housing.  Across CoreLogic’s combined capitals index, house values (+4.4% over the past three months) have recorded a growth rate more than three times higher than that of its unit counterparts (+1.4%).   There are some tentative signs this trend could become less obvious, with Sydney unit values recording their first month of growth since April last year and Melbourne unit values recording their largest gain since late 2019. ",2021_04_23,1-Mar-21,National NSW QLD VIC NT SA WA ACT TAS,Momentum builds across Australian housing markets as values rise at the fastest rate in seventeen years

"The temporary supplement to JobSeeker payments in Australia are set to finish at the end of March 2021. The JobSeeker ‘coronavirus supplement’ was a temporary boost to new and existing recipients of welfare schemes in response to the onset of COVID-19 including JobSeeker, Youth Allowance, Austudy and the Parenting Payment.  

In early 2020, the supplement was set at an additional $275 per week, virtually doubling payments for some recipients. Recently, it was  announced that as the coronavirus supplement is wound down from March, a permanent $25 increase will be added to payments. While a permanent increase will make some better off, welfare recipients will be worse off by $250 per week compared with the onset of COVID-19.

But will the removal of the JobSeeker supplement have any impact on the housing market?

First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that the JobSeeker supplement has already been reduced significantly in recent months, with no dampening impact apparent on the housing market as a whole.

In late March 2020, the original Jobseeker supplement was set at an additional $275 per week. In late September, the supplement was reduced to $125 per week, and it was reduced further to $75 per week through the first quarter of 2021.

However, housing market momentum has increased from September to January, amid the reduction in the supplement. Between the end of September and January, the CoreLogic national home value index rose 3.2%, and rental values increased 2.5%.

Another consideration is that even as the Jobseeker coronavirus supplement reduced, fewer Australians have been reliant on welfare due to a strong recovery trend in the labour market.

Data from the Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS) suggests there were 11.7% fewer JobSeeker recipients toward the end January 2020, compared with the end of September. However, there is still a heightened risk to wider-spread housing stress, as the number of JobSeeker recipients at January was still 55.9% higher than at the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020. 

Changes to JobSeeker would likely have little direct impact on housing market values. With lower income households generally having lower rates of home ownership, it is more likely that households receiving JobSeeker are renters. This would imply an indirect impact on housing prices, where reduced rental return could impact an investor’s willingness to pay for a property.

However, even looking at regions with the highest proportion of JobSeeker recipients in Australia relative to the local population, rental outcomes have been mixed since the significant reduction of the Jobseeker supplement in September.

This is demonstrated in the table below, which looks at changes in rents since September 2020 through to January 2021 at the SA2 level, in the markets with the highest proportion of JobSeeker recipients.

Only one region in this list has actually seen a decline in rental values, while other SA2 markets have seen an average increase in market rents of 4.2%, which is actually above the 2.5% increase in rent values nationally over the same period.

Importantly, there is no counter-factual for rental performance in these markets where the coronavirus supplement is unchanged. Under these circumstances, rents may have increased even further.

However, what this data does highlight is that the impending changes to JobSeeker could create increased divergence between incomes and housing costs for some of Australia’s most vulnerable households. While these rental markets may be increasing in aggregate, housing stress, and even homelessness, may be faced by individuals whose livelihoods have been impacted by COVID-19. While changes to JobSeeker are unlikely to impact the housing market, the welfare reduction could greatly disrupt housing situations for many.",2021_04_23,1-Mar-21,National NSW QLD VIC SA WA TAS NT ACT,Will changes to JobSeeker impact the housing market?
"Leveraging its strategic partnership with global reinsurer Munich Re, CoreLogic International has analysed Victoria’s residential property climate hazard and risk exposure, revealing very high risk of climate hazard to almost 9% of Victorian properties. 

Dr Pierre Wiart, CoreLogic’s Head of Consulting and Risk Management Solutions, says “Our research revealed almost 9% of Victorian households are at very high risk of climate hazards, with another 8% at high risk. This is equivalent to a combined estimated property value of $277 billion at risk.

""Like most Australian states and territories, Victoria’s diverse landscape is vulnerable to severe weather events such as bushfires, floods and coastal erosion. Future scenarios indicate that both bushfire and flood risks are likely to be on the rise across the regions due to drier environments but also increasing precipitation, albeit separately.” 

Looking at the different climate events, bushfire hazards are significant throughout Victoria, with high-risk areas in Melbourne’s outskirts, particularly to the north of the city.

“While most parts of Victoria face a moderate to high bushfire risk, the risk is highest around Melbourne’s north-east between Melbourne and the Yarra Ranges, from Ballarat to the border of the Lerderderg and Wombat State Parks, and the Great Otway National Park.


“Flood risk is significant from Swan Hill to Echuca and Shepparton due to the Murray River, while the flat landscape of Melbourne and its surrounds creates a flood risk from the Yarra, Maribyrnong and Werribee Rivers. However, accurate future flood projections can be tricky due to conflicting forces at play, namely the relative impacts of drought and precipitation. 


“Rising sea levels are also expected to affect many parts of Victoria under extreme future scenarios. Victoria is already feeling the effects of coastal erosion, with the Victorian Government providing funding to tackle the problem at beaches such as Apollo Bay, Lakes Entrance and Mallacoota. Our research shows that rising sea levels are likely to exacerbate coastal erosion in many parts of the state,” says Dr Wiart.   


CoreLogic’s research analysed over 2.5 million Victorian residential properties to assess climate hazard ratings and risk scenario outcomes appended at property level. The research modelled a range of climate risk scenarios and outlined Victoria’s hazard profile and overall risk level for properties exposed to bushfire, drought, precipitation and sea level rise. It quantified the value and volume of properties exposed to different climate hazards and assigned standardised risk ratings.

“If you work in financial services, insurance or government, chances are you understand the critical role that a changing climate plays in business, to our customers and the community - both now and into the future. Phenomena like rising sea levels, coastal erosion, bushfires and floods can present a major risk, with potential impacts likely ranging from reduced asset value and credit losses to financial losses due to damaged property and infrastructure,” says Dr Wiart.

Businesses have long factored these events into their risk assessments at an aggregate level. Now they have the power to go deeper. CoreLogic is supporting businesses and government to advance their understanding of the potential impact of climate change on the property market by creating a concurrent view of natural hazards and estimated property values. The hazards can be mapped and can allow for targeted approaches to risk management and customer education.

“While no one knows exactly what tomorrow will bring, access to the right data can provide a strong foundation for informed decision-making in uncertain times. Business leaders and decision makers, for example, may be better equipped to assess climate hazards when they have data that drills down to the level of individual properties. Now, these types of game-changing insights are about to be available in Australia and New Zealand.

“Armed with this information, businesses can employ a sophisticated approach to quantifying climate change impact, enhancing risk management and making informed decisions – each of which can also benefit their customers,” says Dr Wiart.

"CoreLogic’s national Cordell Housing Index Price rose by 1.0 per cent over the three months to December 2020, after the previous quarter increased by a lower 0.6 per cent.

The Cordell Housing Index Price (CHIP) measures the rate of change of construction costs within the residential market and covers freestanding and semi-detached single and two storey dwellings.

The final index for 2020 showed residential construction costs were 3.6 per cent higher annually. Meanwhile, figures show the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 1.6 per cent over the September 2020 quarter, compared to a fall of -1.9 per cent over the previous quarter which was largely driven by free child care and price falls in automotive fuels. 

According to seasonally adjusted ABS figures, the total number of dwellings approved rose by 2.6 per cent in November, while employment in the construction industry, which accounts for around 9.2 per cent of the total workforce, increased by 2.0 per cent over the three months to November 2020.

Tim Lawless, Executive Director of Research at CoreLogic, says the CHIP index was building momentum through the final quarter of 2020, in-line with a surge in new residential house building activity. 

“With dwelling approvals for houses at record highs, it’s likely we will see additional pressure growing on constructions costs as demand continues to build for residential construction materials and resources.

“The lift in residential construction costs is likely to flow through to higher prices for built residential products and also place upwards pressure on inflation where housing costs receive the heaviest weighting within the CPI ‘basket’ of goods.

“Although HomeBuilder is phasing out after March, it’s highly likely we will see a continuation in this trend towards higher residential construction costs.  It will take some time for builders to work through the pipeline of house approvals that have surged through the second half of last year,” says Mr Lawless.

This time last year, 76.6 per cent of reported auctions were successful. It is likely that Sydney’s final clearance rate will come in around the low to mid 80 per cent range for the 4th consecutive week. Across the smaller cities, Canberra recorded the highest preliminary clearance rate at 84.7 per cent, followed by Adelaide (82.5 per cent) and Brisbane (79.0 per cent).

"In the year to January, CoreLogic estimates that there were 459,308 properties transacted across Australia. Most of these sales were houses, rather than units. 

It is not unusual for house sales to make up the majority of transactions, with houses making up an average 70.2% of annual sales volumes over the past decade. However, the share of houses as a portion of sales increased to 74.2% in the year to January 2021, up from 73.2% a year ago and 66.7% five years ago. Another way of thinking about it, is that for every 1 unit sold over the year, there were 2.9 house sales. 

 


The map below shows the portion of sales over the year that were houses, compared with the decade average, for various regions. Most capital city and rest of state regions saw the portion of house sales elevated in the year to January, compared with the decade average. The general uplift in the share of sales that were houses through the year to January may be attributed to a few of factors. 

 


The introduction of HomeBuilder may have skewed demand toward houses. Since the announcement of HomeBuilder in June, new home sales have increased significantly. According to the HIA, new home sales in the December 2020 quarter were almost 100% higher than in December 2019. 

However, the design of the scheme largely lent itself to new houses, as opposed to units. An example of this was the tight timelines for eligibility, where the commencement of a new property initially had to take place within three months of the contract date. 

This meant the take up of the scheme was largely utilised for detached houses, rather than off the plan unit sales, with the latter requiring a number of purchaser commitments before the project commences. 

This trend was reaffirmed in ABS dwelling approval data, where approvals for house builds were up 13.9% in the year to December 2020, compared with an -8.6% decline in units approvals. CoreLogic sales volumes only count new properties as sold upon settlement, so the portion of new home sales over 2020 may continue to trend even higher once new house builds are completed.

Investor lending was low, and investors may prefer units. The value of finance commitments for the purchase of investment property, as reported by the ABS, has a stronger positive correlation with unit sales than houses. Comparing a decade of sales volumes with investor finance commitment values produced a correlation coefficient of 0.74 with units, and 0.48 with houses. 

This could be because investors have historically outweighed owner occupiers across the unit sector. Over 2020, the average value lent to investors for the purchase of property was $5.1 billion per month. This is 22.7% below the monthly average in the past decade. The relatively low levels of investment activity may have been compounded by weak rental markets, particularly in highly-concentrated investment markets like inner-city Sydney and Melbourne, which are largely comprised of unit stock. 

House sales rise as a percentage of total sales when prices fall. Continued falls in investment financing does not entirely explain the fall of units as a share of total sales. After all, April to June 2019 marked the period where house sales had reached the highest concentration of sales over the decade, at 75.1%. During this time, the value of investor lending was low, but not at its lowest. What did happen during that time however, was a bottoming out in housing values nationally. When houses become more affordable, they may become increasingly preferable to units. Similarly, an increase in house prices, such as has been observed in recent months, may pivot demand back to units, where purchase prices are generally lower and housing affordability less challenging. 

Based on this reasoning, there are headwinds for house sales in the year ahead; the end of the HomeBuilder scheme, a recovery in investor lending levels and rising house prices could challenge the popularity of detached dwellings over the year. 

But there are arguments for desirability of detached dwellings in 2021. Anecdotally, houses have offered reprieve from density during a pandemic, and remote working arrangements have allowed people to seek relatively affordable houses in regional Australia. 

Another consideration is that unit rents have seen weaker performance than houses over the year, which may see investor demand gravitate toward houses. First home buyers may also continue to drive house sales, as Sydney and Melbourne house values sat -2.7% and -6.5% below the respective peaks as of January.  ",2021_04_23,16-Feb-21,National NSW VIC QLD SA WA TAS NT ACT,The house always wins: why house sales vastly outstripped unit sales over the year
"Auction markets have returned a strong result on higher volumes this week, with the combined capitals weighted average preliminary clearance rate holding above 80%.  Every capital city recorded a clearance rate above 70% as volumes continued to surge higher after the festive period slowdown.

Capital City Auction Statistics (Preliminary)

There were 1,287 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 83.8%, an improvement on the 81.1% preliminary result last week when a lower 884 auctions took place.  Last week’s clearance rate revised down to 77.2% by final figures on Wednesday; it’s likely this week’s result may come in above this given the higher preliminary figure. Over the same week last year, auction volumes were lower with 1,167 homes going under the hammer across the combined capital cities, returning a final auction clearance rate of just 67.7%. 

Weekly Clearance Rate, Combined Capital Cities

In Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 80.8% was recorded across 592 auctions this week, while last week there were 390 auctions returning a final clearance rate of 80%. One year ago, the clearance rate was just 68.5% across 419 auctions. 

There were 449 auctions held in Sydney this week, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 89.1%. In comparison, there were 270 auctions held over the previous week and the final auction clearance rate was 76.7%. One year ago, 384 auctions were held across the city and the clearance rate came in at 77.6%. 


Across the smaller auction markets, Canberra returned the highest preliminary clearance rate of 92.7%, followed by Adelaide (82.8%), Perth (75%) and Brisbane (74.6%).
Such strong auction results signal further upwards pressure on housing prices amidst extremely tight advertised supply levels and above average buyer demand.

"Low interest rates, strong institutional responses and rapidly improving economic conditions have been central factors supporting the rebound in housing markets.  With mortgage rates likely to remain at record lows well into 2022, housing values are expected to keep rising.

The RBA has previously acknowledged asset prices would appreciate in an environment of persistently low interest rates and create stronger household balance sheets, via improved housing wealth. This could help to offset risks in other areas of the economy, including a decline in private sector consumption and investment.  Based on the recent flow of data, those assumptions are looking well founded.

CoreLogic’s January home value index showed Australian housing values reached new record highs after rising 3.2% since September last year. Retail sales rose 13.3% year-on-year, and both consumer and business confidence are trending well above pre-COVID levels. 

It is likely the RBA will continue to look through the recent upwards trend in housing values, focusing more on targeting inflation, keeping the Australian dollar competitive, and ensuring credit remains cheap and available, especially for business lending. 

With housing prices expected to keep rising, attention will once again turn towards housing affordability.  Importantly, the most unaffordable markets, Sydney and Melbourne, are recording the mildest growth conditions. Meanwhile, it is the most affordable capital cities of Darwin and Perth, where housing values are rising the most rapidly.

If the RBA, along with other members of the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR), see financial stability risks emanating from the housing market, there are mechanisms other than monetary policy that would help to curtail risk.  Macroprudential levers proved to be effective previously when the CFR became concerned about investor and interest-only lending becoming over-represented in the market.  A new round of credit tightening would probably have the same effect in reducing credit availability in specific areas of risk.  ",2021_04_23,3-Feb-21,National NSW QLD VIC SA WA TAS ACT NT,Cash rate unchanged at first RBA Board meeting of 2021
"Housing values continued to rise through the first month of 2021 with CoreLogic’s national home value index up 0.9% over the month.  The January movement takes Australian home values to a fresh record high. Housing values have surpassed pre-COVID levels by 1.0%, and the index is 0.7% higher than the previous September 2017 peak.

Every capital city and broad rest-of-state region recorded a rise in housing values over the month, ranging from a 2.3% surge across Darwin to a relatively mild 0.4% rise in Sydney and Melbourne. 

Continuing a trend that became evident early in the pandemic, regional housing values rose at more than twice the pace of the capital city markets. CoreLogic’s combined regionals index was up 1.6% over the month, while capital city values were 0.7% higher.  Since the onset of COVID-19 in March last year, regional housing values have surged 6.5% higher while capital city housing values are down -0.2% over the same time frame.

The largest states are seeing regional home values rising at more than three times the pace of their capital city counterparts. Home values across Regional Victoria and Regional New South Wales rose 1.6% and 1.5% respectively in January compared with a 0.4% increase in home values across Melbourne and Sydney.

According to CoreLogic’s research director, Tim Lawless, the divergence between metro and regional housing demand in New South Wales and Victoria is more substantial than in other states.  “Internal migration data shows more people are leaving Sydney and Melbourne for regional areas, resulting in a transition of activity from the metro regions to the outer fringe and regional markets.  This demographic trend is further compounded by the demand shock of stalled overseas migration. As Melbourne and Sydney historically receive the vast majority of overseas migrants, these metro areas have been the hardest hit by this demand shock.”

“Better housing affordability, an opportunity for a lifestyle upgrade and lower density housing options are other factors that might be contributing to this trend, along with the new found popularity of remote working arrangements.”

Another broad trend that is becoming increasingly evident is the outperformance of houses over units.  At a national level, house values have risen by 3.5% over the past six months while unit values are unchanged.  More recently, the past three months has seen every capital city record a stronger result for houses over units.

“Demand for units has diminished through COVID-19 amidst record low levels of investor participation and changing living preferences.  At the same time supply levels are heightened in some precincts.  While demand and supply remain imbalanced we are likely to see units continue to underperform relative to detached housing markets,” Mr Lawless said.

"The latest CoreLogic Regional Market Update, which looks at capital growth over the 12 months to January 2021 in Australia’s 25 largest non-capital city markets, saw Richmond-Tweed claim top spot for houses with 12.6 per cent annual growth. The Southern Highlands & Shoalhaven took top spot for units for the second consecutive quarter at 17.9 per cent annual growth.

CoreLogic’s Executive Director of Research, Tim Lawless, says regional housing values rose at more than four times the pace than capital city markets over the 12 months to January. 

“CoreLogic’s combined regionals index was up 7.9 per cent over the 12 month period compared with a 1.7 per cent lift in combined capital city home values. As more Australian’s look for properties outside of the capital cities, an imbalance between demand and supply is placing upwards pressure on housing prices.  This is most apparent in markets like Richmond-Tweed, which includes high profile towns such as Byron Bay and Tweed Heads.

“Demand for regional housing can be attributed to a range of factors.  Generally, prices are cheaper than their capital city counterparts, housing densities are typically lower which is likely to be appealing amidst a global pandemic, and many workers have a new found appreciation and ability to work remotely which is supporting additional demand.”

Best & Worst Performing Regional House Markets – January 2021

Best & Worst Performing Regional Unit Markets – January 2021

Mr Lawless says how long the trend of regional outperformance can last is anyone’s guess, but at the moment it looks like it has some momentum behind it.

“As the pricing gap narrows between the regions and capital cities, the challenge of affordability will naturally drag on demand.  Similarly, as the virus is more comprehensively brought under control, we will likely see more employers looking for their staff to return to the office, at least on a rostered or flexible basis.  

“However, to some extent we expect the rise in popularity of regional markets will persist into the future.  Many workers and employers have found the working from home experiment to be successful, with productivity remaining high while workers enjoy additional flexibility in their work life balance. Areas that offer up the best of both worlds; an ability to commute into the capital city metro areas while living regionally may be more successful long term.”

Most of the reporting on regional areas around the country has focussed on the main population centres outside of the capital cities, such as high profile coastal regions like Byron and Noosa, or semi-rural markets like the wine regions and hinterland locations close to the major metro regions. However,  recent CoreLogic analysis* on the annul change in house values across rural in-land council regions found many of Australia’s in-land rural markets are also showing strong housing market conditions.  

Mr Lawless says “32 of the 91 in-land regions analysed had house values tracking at record highs in January 2021. These were typically skewed towards the largest rural population centres, where economic conditions generally show greater diversity.  Seven of the 10 largest population centres recorded house values at historical highs. On the flipside, 41 of the 91 council regions analysed recorded house values that remained at least 10% below their historic highs.  

“Many of these markets are moving out of a period of extended decline, mostly due to either drought conditions or the mining downturn. The rise in values is likely to be a welcome development for long-term home owners in the area,” says Mr Lawless.",2021_04_23,19-Feb-21,National NSW VIC QLD SA WA TAS NT ACT,"Demand for regional housing continues, shows latest CoreLogic Regional Market Update"
"There has been no shortage of reporting about the relatively strong performance of regional Australian dwelling markets over 2020. December home value data showed the combined regional dwelling market increased 6.9% in value over the year; a growth rate more than three times the rate of the combined capital cities. 

 

But even more impressive than value changes in 2020, is the return that some areas have shown in the longer term. 

This can be seen when looking at 10 year annualised growth rates, which is the average annual compounding growth rate over the past 10 years. By this metric, some ‘secondary cities’ have performed just as well as, if not better than, their capital city counterparts. This is a particularly prominent trend across the eastern seaboard.  

This set of charts shows that 10 year annualised growth rates in large, coastal dwelling markets are closer to the performance of capital city sub markets than the rest of regional Australia. 

 

  

In NSW, 10 year annualised growth rates were 5.0% across Illawarra, and 4.5% across both the Newcastle Lake Macquarie region, and the Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven region. This compares to an average of 5.1% across the Sydney sub-markets, and an average of just 2.1% across the rest of regional NSW. 

In Victoria, Geelong has a long run annualised growth rate of 4.1%, which is also closer to the average of the capital cities (3.7%) than the rest of regional Victoria (2.7%). 

Across Queensland, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast have seen long term growth rates align more closely with average increases across the capital city sub markets (1.5%). But further to this, the 10 year annualised growth rates have surpassed the increases in every other capital city and regional sub market across the sunshine state. 

COVID may have exacerbated the trend, but did not start it

Why have major coastal markets performed so well in the past decade? A major driver of dwelling market value increases comes from population growth. Out of 88 sub-markets across Australia, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast have seen the highest volume of net internal migration, or arrivals minus departures from other parts of the country, for the three years to June 2019. Over this time, these markets gained 39,770 additional residents from other parts of Australia.  

While the trend of moving from capital cities to regional Australia is nothing new, COVID-19 may have exacerbated the desirability of regional Australia. This may be because relatively strict restrictions were implemented across major capital cities, and remote work has been increasingly enforced as a way to combat the spread of COVID-19. 

But population growth is unlikely to be the only factor at play. The Illawarra region attracted just 718 additional residents internally in the three years to June 2019, but has one of the highest annualised 10 year returns of regional Australian dwelling markets. One of the reasons for the longer term popularity of markets major coastal centres could be proximity to major cities. 

The rise of cities within a ‘commutable distance’ to the capital cities have enabled a regional lifestyle with the benefit of maintaining access to the employment opportunity and amenity of the capitals. This combination has attracted a greater price premium over time. Previous notes have also reflected on the idea that nearby coastal markets may rise in value as capital cities become less affordable, creating a ‘spill over’ of demand as people are priced out of cities. 

With a positive outlook in place for housing assets in 2021, regional Australian dwelling markets may continue to rise in value. Looking back, these results suggest the best long term returns are not always found in the capital city dwelling markets.   ",2021_04_23,25-Jan-21,National NSW VIC QLD,Four charts that show regional returns in a league of their own
"CoreLogic’s Auction Market Review for the December quarter 2020 saw the combined capital city clearance rate continue to strengthen, while auction volumes increased by 44 per cent over the same period.

The combined capital city clearance rate was recorded at 69.4 per cent over the December quarter, making it the best performing quarter of 2020, followed by the March 2020 at 62.5 per cent.

Auction volumes increased by 44.1 per cent over the three months to December, with 20,489 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, up from 14,216 over the September quarter.

CoreLogic’s Head of Research Australia, Eliza Owen, says the bulk of this uplift can be attributed to Melbourne.

“65.2% of the uplift can be attributed to the resurgence of auctions scheduled across Melbourne. Vendor activity became pent up during stage four restrictions across the city, leading to a delayed flurry of activity. As restrictions eased we saw new listings soar across Melbourne with people looking to sell, and last year the seasonal drop off in auction activity happened about a week later than we would typically expect, as agents tried to keep up with vendor demand.

“While the three months to December was the busiest quarter of 2020, it was significantly lower than the December 2019 quarter, when 26,923 homes were taken to auction across the combined capitals.

“Based on the momentum that was building in the market towards the end of 2020, along with strong selling conditions and record low interest rates, we would expect auction results to continue on a strong footing into 2021 as volumes ramp up, providing there’s no major resurgence of COVID-19 in the community which would serve to dampen the momentum building late last year,” says Ms Owen.

Of the 20,411 auction results collected over the latest quarter, just 8.9 per cent reported a withdrawn result, compared to 18.7 per cent over the September quarter and 31.0 per cent over the June quarter. Of the sold results, 36.8 per cent were sold prior to auction, compared to 42.0 per cent over the September quarter and 47.8 per cent over the June quarter.

"CoreLogic’s Pain and Gain report for the September 2020 quarter released today has revealed Hobart retained its position as the capital city with the highest rate of profit making resales at 96.6%, while regional Victoria was the most profitable ‘rest of state’ region with 97.5% of dwellings sold for a profit in the three months to September.

Nationally, the proportion of resales that made a profit was 88.1% or $24.8 billion in profits, up from 87.2% or $19.8 billion in the June 2020 quarter. However, the amount of losses also deepened on non-profitable sales, from -$885 million in the June quarter to -$1.2 billion in September.

Eliza Owen, CoreLogic’s Head of Research Australia, says the Pain and Gain analysis for the September quarter reflects the resilience seen in the property market throughout 2020.

“Each of the greater capital city markets, with the exception of Melbourne, saw an increase in the rate of profit making sales over the September quarter. The highest rate of profit making sales was across Hobart, which has been the case since March 2018.

“Coastal regional markets were also particularly profitable for sellers, with profit making sales representing over 95% of resales across six major coastal markets: Geelong, Illawarra, the Mid North Coast, the Newcastle Lake Macquarie region, the Richmond Tweed region and the Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast hit a record high rate of profit making sales in the September quarter at 96.4%”, says Ms Owen.

Comparing the capital cities to regional Australia, the portion of profit-making sales increased more rapidly across the regions than capitals.

“The combined regional Australian market saw the rate of profit making sales increase 150 basis points, to 89.2% in the September quarter, while the rate of profitability across capital city markets expanded 30 basis points, to 87.2%. This also reflects the divergent performance between regional and capital city real estate markets through 2020.”

Houses vs Units

The report also demonstrates that there was generally a higher rate of return for houses ($225,000) than units ($125,000).

“Profitability across both houses and units rose across Australia in the September 2020 quarter. The portion of properties sold at a loss among houses fell from 10.2% in the three months to June to 9.6%, while the portion of loss making unit sales fell from 21.4% to 19.6%.

The differential between house and unit profitability narrowed to 10 percentage points in the September quarter, down from 11.2 percentage points in the three months to June. The narrowed differential was a result of unit profitability rising faster than that of houses. Even though the rate of loss making sales declined faster across the unit segment, units were still about 2 times more likely to sell for a loss than houses in the September quarter.

Investors vs Owner Occupiers

A higher portion of property investors sold their dwelling at a loss during the September quarter compared with owner occupiers. Investor sales in the September quarter saw 17.1% of properties sell for a loss, compared with 10.4% of owner occupied sales.

Ms Owen says “Despite the higher rate of loss observed in investor sales in the quarter, the rate of properties re-sold at a loss was down from 18.0% in the June quarter, while the rate of loss making sales among owner occupiers was down from 11.1%.

“The only region where there was a higher incidence of loss making sales among owner occupiers was across Hobart. This has been a consistent trend across the past few quarters. In the three months to September, 3.2% of owner occupied resales saw a nominal loss, compared with just 1% of investor sales.

“The relatively low level of loss making sales among both cohorts reflects the exceptional capital growth across the Hobart market. CoreLogic home value indices show dwelling values across Hobart have seen annualised growth of 7.9% for the 5 years to December 2020, the highest annualised growth rate of the capital city markets,” says Ms Owen.

Hold periods

Analysing returns by hold period suggests a greater amount of gain comes from more time in the market.

“Over the September 2020 quarter, the median hold period of re-sale events across Australia was approximately 8.5 years. For profit making sales, the median hold period was 9 years, while loss making sales were typically held for 6.7 years. For houses and units, typical hold periods were longer across profit making resales,” says Ms Owen.

Looking ahead, Ms Owen says the Australian housing market is expected to improve further in the coming months. “With record low mortgage rates, a faster than expected economic recovery and relatively low cases of COVID-19, profitability is tipped to trend upwards over the coming quarters.”

This edition of the Pain and Gain report analyses approximately 72,000 residential property re-sale events over the September 2020 quarter.

"Australia’s housing market finished the year on a strong footing with CoreLogic’s national home value index rising a further 1.0% in December; the third consecutive month-on-month rise following a -2.1% drop in dwelling values between April and September. 

Australian home values finished the year 3.0% higher with regional housing values rising by 6.9%, a rate of capital gain that was more than three times higher than the combined capitals, where home values were up 2.0% over the year.

CoreLogic’s research director, Tim Lawless, said the year was characterised by a mild COVID dip in values, but unprecedented volatility in the transaction space. “The number of residential property sales plummeted by -40% through March and April but finished the year with almost 8% more sales relative to a year ago as buyer numbers surged through the second half of the year. Despite the volatility, housing values showed remarkable resilience, falling by only -2.1% before rebounding with strength throughout the final quarter of 2020.”

Index results as at December 31, 2020


In retrospect, the rebound in housing market activity and dwelling values is unsurprising given the rapid and substantial monetary and fiscal response from the Government and policy makers. “Record low interest rates played a key role in supporting housing market activity, along with a spectacular rise in consumer confidence as COVID-related restrictions were lifted and forecasts for economic conditions turned out to be overly pessimistic. Containing the spread of the virus has been critical to Australia’s economic and housing market resilience,” Mr Lawless said.

As remote working opportunities became more prevalent and demand for lifestyle properties and lower density housing options became more popular, regional areas of Australia saw housing market conditions surge. “Regional housing markets had generally underperformed relative to the capital city regions over the past decade, but 2020 saw regional housing values surge as demand outweighed supply,” said Mr Lawless.

Month-on-month change in national dwelling values


On the flipside, higher density housing has generally underperformed throughout the year, with capital city unit values holding reasonably firm (+0.2%) while house values were up 2.6%. Excluding Melbourne, every capital city recorded a higher rate of capital gain for houses relative to units in 2020. According to Mr Lawless, the stronger growth conditions for houses over units is due to a range of factors. “Unit markets have historically been more popular amongst investor buyers; demand from investors has been weighed down by weak rental conditions across the unit sector along with high supply levels in some precincts. A transition of demand towards lower density housing options has helped to buoy house values.”

Change in dwelling values


Although housing markets are gathering pace, four of the eight capitals are still recording dwelling values lower relative to their previous peaks. Melbourne home values are still -4.1% below their March 2020 peak and Sydney dwelling values need to recover a further 3.9% before surpassing the previous July 2017 peak. Perth and Darwin values remain -19.9% and -25.7% below their 2014 peaks.

"CoreLogic’s Rental Market Review for the December 2020 quarter released today has reiterated the diverse rental conditions across Australia over the year, with regional markets outperforming capital cities and unit markets recording weak conditions across the largest capital cities. 

December 2020 saw Australia’s dwelling market record the largest monthly increase in rental rates since 2010, up 0.6% over the month. The 10 year record can be attributed to growth across the house market which saw a 0.9% rise in rental rates over the month, more than offsetting a -0.1% fall in unit rents.

Across the broad regions, regional markets were the standout performer with both house and unit rents up 1.1% in December, taking house rents 2.9% higher over the final quarter of 2020 and unit rents 2.6% higher.

CoreLogic’s research director Tim Lawless, says “COVID-19 not only disrupted how we live, but also reshaped housing demand as accommodation preferences swung towards lower density options.

“Higher density housing markets have seen less demand during the pandemic; a trend that has been amplified by stalled overseas migration and remote working opportunities luring residents further afield.  Whether this trend has some longevity is yet to be seen, but international borders are likely to remain closed for some time yet, and for many, remote working conditions have proved to be productive.”

Meanwhile the combined capital cities saw further divergence in house and unit rents; a theme seen throughout 2020 as inner city unit markets feel the impact of reduced demand amidst the pandemic environment.

Capital city house rents increased by 0.7% in December to be 0.8% higher in Q4, while unit rental rates across the capital cities fell -0.3% over the month to be down -1.6% over the December quarter.

Despite the diverse performance over the year, national rents rose by 1.9% annually in 2020, which was the largest annual increase across the dwelling market since mid-2018.

"Property investor activity in the Australian housing market has been falling since early 2015, after macro-prudential policies were implemented in Australian mortgage lending.  Apart from a brief ‘bounce’ in 2016, investor participation has been consistently trending lower. The latest ABS housing finance data shows the portion of housing finance for the purchase of property lent to investors fell to a fresh record low of 23.5% in August. This is significantly lower than the decade average of 36.1%.

 The decline of the property investor has been brought about by multiple factors. These include:

temporary policies implemented between 2014 and 2019, which limited lending products favoured by investors; 
 
mortgage rate premiums for investor loans;
 
less appetite for high LVR and interest only lending from the banking sector;
 
less certainty around prospects for capital gains;
 
high levels of housing construction which have softened rental returns; and, 
 
the recent global pandemic, which has created a particular negative demand shock to the rental market, thereby further inhibiting returns.


But can we expect investor activity to keep declining? When comparing investor activity at the state level with CoreLogic rental data, there are clear differences between markets that may appeal to investors, versus those where the retreat could last longer. 


NSW. For the past decade, investor participation in mortgage activity averaged 41.9% across NSW and moved through a record high in late 2014 when investors comprised 55.6% of mortgage demand. By August 2020, investors as a proportion of housing finance had fallen 28.2 percentage points from that peak, to 27.4%. 

Across NSW, returns to investors vary greatly by submarket in both the growth of the value of property assets and rental return. Broadly however, dwelling values across NSW sit 3.5% below the record high reached in July 2017. Gross rental yields across the state were 3.23% in September, which is just 2 basis points off the record low from October 2017. 

Rental market performance has been highly varied through the COVID-19 period. As one of Australia’s two major international cities, the closure of international borders has created significant shock to the rental market, where new migrants to Australia typically rent. Outer suburban and regional markets have seen upward pressure on rents, but the wind-back of stimulus to households affected by COVID, and cheaper rents closer to the city, may erode this growth over the coming months. Ultimately, the biggest boost to investor returns, and an uptick in investor activity, will be dependent on international travel resuming to Australia.  

VIC. Victoria, namely Melbourne, had the highest exposure to overseas migration as a source of new housing demand prior to COVID-19, which has significantly impacted rental values, particularly those in inner city markets. Across Greater Melbourne, unit rents have declined 5.5%, but in submarkets such as Melbourne City, unit rents have seen much more acute declines of -16.2% since March. Gross rental yields across the state were 3.4% in September, down from 3.7% one year ago.

With dwelling values also down 5.5% across Melbourne, and half a per cent across regional Victoria since the pandemic, investor interest is likely to remain subdued until international travel resumes. Investors who can afford low or no rental income may take advantage of lower property values towards the market trough. 

QLD. Investor participation in the QLD dwelling market shifted significantly lower over 2017, and again with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inner Brisbane in particular has seen high levels of unit development, which has placed downward pressure on rents over time. Since the onset of Stage 2 pandemic restrictions in March, Inner Brisbane unit rents have declined a further -4.8%.

Despite a long period of high supply and subdued investor participation, gross rental yields across the state are far higher than NSW and VIC, largely due to relatively low dwelling values. A typical dwelling value at September was around $505,000 across Brisbane, and $388,000 across regional QLD. Gross rental yields across the state were 4.8% in September, down from 5.0% a year ago. 

 

SA. South Australian rental markets have been tightening for the past few years, with positive growth in the Adelaide rental market since 2017. At September, Adelaide had the second highest annual rent value growth of the city markets at 2.6% over the year, putting rental income growth well above inflation. 

Despite the stronger fundamentals, investor participation as a share of mortgage activity has continued to decline. The portion of investor finance was 20.4% at August, down from the decade average of 31.7%. However, the rate of decline in investment activity has not been as steep as in other parts of the country. Between record low mortgage rates, low dwelling prices, volatility and a tightening rental market, South Australia may see an increase in investor participation over the coming quarters.

WA. Western Australia has actually seen a turn in investor participation, and is bucking the general trend of subdued investor activity. Since bottoming out in April at 14.5%, the share of mortgage finance for the purchase of property to investors has climbed to 17.0%. This comes after a long period of correction in the Perth property market, which saw momentum gradually gathering in prices and rents from early 2020. Rental values across Perth grew significantly higher than the national average, at 4.8% in the year to September, which will likely see investor participation continue to rise. Typical gross rent yields across WA were 4.7% at September, up from 4.6% one year ago.  

TAS. For years, Tasmania has been a source of strong capital and rental growth. Between annualised growth and rental return, total annualised return was 12.3% across the state for the past five years. However, COVID-19 has created a severe disruption to the rental market. Unit rent values in particular have declined -5.6%, which is the steepest fall of the capital city markets. The loosening of rental markets since COVID-19, which has likely had something to do with Airbnb properties converted to the long term market, has provided some much-needed relief for renters. With a steep retreat in investor participation since March, first home buyers may also face less competition. However, the return of international and inter-state travel would likely see rental markets tighten once more, as short-term accommodation owners revert their properties in preparation for increased tourism. 

ACT. The portion of investment across the ACT does not appear to be as disrupted by COVID-19 as other states and territories, but has still trended down over time. Investor share of mortgage activity has fallen to 24.6%, from a decade average of 32.6%. Gross rental yields have compressed across the region, from 4.7% in September 2019 to 4.5% at September 2020. This is likely the result of dwelling value increases since the onset of COVID, and may weaken investor interest in the coming months. 

NT. Across Darwin, rental yields are the highest of any capital city market at 5.9%. However, this is has largely been a function of a long property price correction, where both rent values and property values have declined over time. The start of 2020 has signaled a recovery in values, with Darwin dwellings up 2.7% from March through to September. Although investor participation was the lowest of the states and territories at 12.6%, the sheer cyclical correction of Darwin values sees the typical dwelling value at just under $400,000, and may see a gradual recovery in investor interest. 


The patterns in respective rental markets suggest that from an affordability and yield perspective, smaller capital city markets may see increasing popularity from investors in the coming months. For the traditional investor markets such as inner city Sydney and Melbourne, COVID-19 has triggered a further retreat of investors that is likely to last until overseas migration and travel resumes.

"Three major housing-related measures were highlighted in Treasurer Frydenberg’s budget address on the 6th of October: an extension of the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme (FHLDS), additional low-cost financing for affordable housing through NHFIC, and additional funding for the Indigenous Home Ownership Program. 

Other measures detailed in the budget papers included a proposed capital gains exemption for granny flats for eligible persons from July next year, and a continuation of funding for state social housing services.  

The papers also note that the expansion of the first home loan deposit scheme will be complemented by announced changes to ease credit regulations, which would boost credit availability. 

Funnelling new demand into new property

First home owners have previously been a target of demand-side housing stimulus during economic downturns. Currently, Australia may be in a demographic ‘sweet spot’ for first home buyer demand. The relatively large millennial generation is now estimated to be aged around 26 to 37 years old. According to ABS data, this puts millennials into the most common first home buyer age groups.  Alongside the typical barriers to entry for hopeful first home buyers, this may be one of the reasons the first home loan deposit scheme has been so well-subscribed since its introduction in January this year. 

The extension to the FHLDS will see an additional 10,000 places available between the 6th of October and the 30th of June 2021, adding to the 20,000 places made available since the scheme started in January 2020.

However, these additional places are for construction or purchase of newly-built homes. The price thresholds have also been increased for newly built homes, which would potentially further incentivise a pivot away from the established housing market. The change in purchasing thresholds by region are summarised below. 

 


It will be interesting to see if these conditions create as rapid an uptake as the places for established housing. In 2008, the temporary boost to the first home owner grant provided added incentives for new builds, yet 85% of its uptake was directed at established housing₁. 

However, incentives limited to new home builds could still help soften the blow to dwelling construction through COVID-19.  Since the introduction of the HomeBuilder scheme, new home sales have been boosted across Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland. CoreLogic data shows valuations ordered for the purpose of construction loans have seen a boost above pre-COVID levels since the introduction of the HomeBuilder scheme. 

 


In terms of the impact these schemes would have on the established market, the increased incentive for new home builds could reduce established home prices if demand is diverted from this sector. However, the price of newly built homes may rise up to the threshold cut-off. 

It is worth noting that despite the rhetoric employed around the extension of the scheme supporting the construction sector, the budget papers highlight that this will not be enough to offset a decline in new dwelling investment. At August, dwelling approvals for units had fallen -18.4% year-on-year. The budget papers forecast an 11% decline in dwelling investment over 2020-21, before rising 7% in 2021-22. 

Indirect Impacts on Housing

With much of this year’s budget focused on the labour market, infrastructure construction and tax cuts, one could be forgiven for thinking housing reform and stimulus took a back seat in this year’s budget. 

However, some of the budget highlights will also have implications for housing. These include:

The JobMaker hiring credit and JobTrainer fund. These initiatives may help re-absorption of young people into the labour force following the initial pandemic-induced shock. This reflects the disproportionate job loss of young people throughout COVID-19, where around 40% of job losses between March and August were among those aged 24 and under. Job loss among younger Australians may present less direct risk to the housing market due to their lower likelihood of holding mortgage debt. However, support for youth employment may create more buoyancy in the rental market, where inner-city markets in particular have seen rental income declines since the onset of COVID-19.
 
A boost to infrastructure spending. Depending on the nature of infrastructure projects, surrounding housing markets could see a rise or fall in demand. Much of this year’s infrastructure allocation is in roadworks, which can have positive impacts on nearby housing by increasing accessibility to an area, but devalue properties with exposure to high traffic intensity, construction and noise pollution.
 
Support for regional Australia. The budget outlines $350 million in support for regional tourism to attract domestic visitation, and seeks to strengthen regional industry through concessional loans to farmers and access for exporters to global supply chains. This may further generate interest in regional dwelling markets, beyond what has resulted from COVID-19 and the normalisation of remote work. However, it worth noting this budget allocated little to fossil fuel alternatives, with climate change presenting on ongoing challenge to the liveability of some regional markets. 

 

Beyond the Budget

Further to the budget, there have been many institutional interventions which have likely played a role in stabilising housing market conditions since COVID-19. These include, but are not limited to:

A comprehensive monetary easing package from the RBA, which saw a reduction of the cash rate to 0.25%, bond yield targeting and the establishment of a term funding facility which has been extended to June next year;
 
Early access to $10,000 of superannuation in 2019/20 and 2020/21;
 
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) changed capital ratio expectations for the banking sector in March, facilitated home loan deferrals and later extended the availability of deferrals to March 2021;
 
The availability of JobKeeper and a boost to JobSeeker, which were made available from March, and extended to March 2021, albeit in a tapered form; and, 
 
A mix of state-based incentives for home buyers, such as the Building Bonus grant in WA, the Home Improvement Scheme in the NT, and temporary stamp duty discounts in NSW.


These events remind us that housing does not operate in a vacuum. Many different factors are currently supporting housing demand. This has created a turn in housing market sentiment, which is seeing prices rise across the small capital cities, and a softening of price declines across Sydney and Melbourne. 

Looking forward, there may still be more tailwinds to come. The RBA left the cash rate on hold in October ahead of the budget, but hinted in the final sentence of the statement on the decision that “additional monetary easing” was possible. A recent address by Deputy Governor Guy Debelle carried the same messaging. Lower interest rates, together with easier access to housing credit could create further housing market demand, given prices have historically increased against a lower cost of debt and greater availability of housing finance options.

Originally posted on CoreLogic.",2021_04_23,9-Oct-20,N/A,What does the federal budget mean for the Australian housing market?
"The past 6 months have highlighted major shifts in Australian housing markets. For example, data hints at demand pivoting from the largest capital city dwelling markets to regional Australia, inner city rental markets suffered from a slowdown in international migration while rents rose in outer-suburbs, and Perth dwellings may be back on track for a long-awaited upswing. 

Median days on market is another data insight that can indicate changes in demand. It is the typical number of days observed between the initial listing of a property and its contract date. CoreLogic prefers to measure median days on market on a rolling, three-month basis which helps to smooth out volatility. When days on market rise, it indicates demand for property is slowing, potentially giving buyers more bargaining power.  Conversely, a trend towards lower days on market implies homes are selling faster and there is reducing scope for negotiation.  

Nationally, the median time on market for a typical dwelling was 45 days in the three months to September. This is lower than in the June quarter, when strict social distancing had slowed transaction activity. However, 45 days is higher than the March 2020 quarter result (44 days), suggesting demand is slightly more subdued than in the months leading up to the pandemic. 

Across the combined capital cities, typical days on market were tight around April of 2020, at just 30 days, reflecting the upwards trajectory in prices and generally strong market conditions pre-COVID. Days on market rose to 44 days in the three months to July, before easing over September to 40 days. 

Regional markets showed a fall in typical days on market over September, to 57 days. This is tighter than pre-COVID conditions, where typical days on market were 59 days in the three months to March.

However, this is still substantially higher than typical days on market for the capital cities. For the past 5 years, regional properties have sat on the market for an average additional 19 days compared with the capital cities, which generally signals demand has often been softer in regional Australia. 
 

Below is a summary of the typical days on market in the three months to March 2020 (the lead-up to COVID-19), and the three months to September. The data is presented for capital city and regional dwelling markets across Australia. 

Sydney and Regional NSW. Properties typically took 36 days to sell across Sydney, and 57 days in regional NSW over the September quarter. As with the national results, days on market typically rose from the June quarter of 2020, and began easing in the three months to September. Between March and September, the biggest increase in days on market in the state was in the Parkes LGA region, increasing by 48 days to 132. Other regions with a significant uplift include the Canterbury-Bankstown LGA, where days on market rose 20 days to 46 days in the September quarter. Across the Lane Cove LGA, the median days on market were the highest of the Sydney metro council areas at 63 days through to September. 

Melbourne and Regional VIC. Days on market across Melbourne rose 6 days between March and September. It is unsurprising to see this increase given the slowdown in transaction activity amid stage 3 and 4 restrictions, and the particular impact that COVID-19 has had on demand for property in Melbourne, which has seen relatively severe job and income loss. However, the typical days on market were highest in the three months to July, easing to 36 in the three months to September. This signals the start of a return to a seller’s market, although a return to stage four restrictions has disrupted this trend. Across regional Victoria, typical days on market fell by 5 days, to 43, signalling tighter conditions, and higher demand than in the lead up to COVID-19. 

Brisbane and Regional QLD. Dwellings across Brisbane have typically taken 45 days to sell over the three months to September. The median selling time has trended down from 46 days in the three months to July, and suggests demand is slowly climbing across the market. In regional QLD, days on market were steady on the three months to March, at 58 days. Lifestyle areas such as the Gold Coast saw days on market climb to 49 in the three months to September, from 43 in the March quarter, but are still down year-on-year. 
Adelaide and Regional SA. The Adelaide market has held relatively steady through COVID-19, with dwelling values up 1.6% since March. Typical days on market fell by 2 days when comparing the March and the September quarters. However, regional SA has seen dwellings take considerably longer to sell, with typical days on market rising to 119.

Perth and Regional WA. Demand across the Perth market is slowly shifting from what has long been               a buyer’s market, to a seller’s market. Despite the pandemic, transaction activity has been quick to recover, with sales volumes rising and new listings volumes increasing to meet new demand. Median days on market have contracted to 40 days through to September, compared with a 5 year average of 52. This is significantly divergent from what was seen in regional WA, where typical days on market have been rising since the end of 2019. The rate of increase in median days on market is starting to slow, which could signal a turn in activity. 

Hobart and Regional TAS. Hobart has had the lowest days on market of all the capital cities and regional areas since September 2016. But from March to September, the city has seen the largest increase in typical days on market of the capital cities. Median days on market rose by 18 days, to 27. While dwelling values continued to increase since the onset of COVID-19, typical days on market may point to some relief for buyers. Median days on market increased by 10 days in regional Tasmania over the period. 

Darwin and Regional NT. Darwin is a buyer’s market. The city had the highest median days on market of the capital cities in the three months to September, at 56. However, this has come down from 72 in the 3 months to March. Regional NT saw an increase in typical days on market, however low levels of transaction activity make the measure quite volatile for the region. 

ACT. Across dwellings, median days on market fell by 7 days since the onset of the pandemic. However, this masks quite different performance between houses and units. Strong demand for houses saw typical days on market shrink from 48 in the three months to March, to 36 in the three months to September. This is down from 55 days over the same period in 2019. Units are much more favourable for buyer bargaining in the current climate, where median days on market were 47 in the three months to September. With September signalling an improvement in housing market conditions amid a more accommodative lending environment, low cases of COVID-19 and higher consumer sentiment, typical days on market could start to trend lower. However, the data shows pockets of opportunity for buyer bargaining.

Originally posted on CoreLogic.",2021_04_23,2-Oct-20,N/A,CoreLogic data reveals where buyer’s bargaining power is rising
"There were 1,107 capital city homes taken to auction this week, of the 841 results collected so far, 70.5% were successful results. This week’s preliminary figure is down on the 72.4% preliminary figure last week, which later revised down to 67.6% by final collection. Last week’s clearance rate was the highest final clearance rate since early March. This time last year, a higher 1,278 capital city homes were auctioned with a final clearance rate of 71%.

The performance across the two largest capital cities remains mixed. Melbourne continued to record very subdued levels of activity, while Sydney volumes reached their highest level since the first week of April.

While volumes remained extremely low across Melbourne, there was a slight rise in the number of homes scheduled to go under the hammer this week. There were 60 auctions scheduled across the city, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of only 28.6%. Of the 49 results collected so far, 31 were withdrawn from the market or 63%. Of the 14 properties that did sell, 93% sold prior to auction.  While volumes did increase over the week, the high withdrawal rate, and high proportion of properties selling prior to the auction, suggest vendors remain reluctant to test the market through the lockdown period.  

There were 815 Sydney homes taken to auction this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 74.8%.  This was an improvement on last week’s preliminary figure of 72.4% which later revised down to 67.5% at final collection.

In contrast to Melbourne, the number of auctions across Sydney has been consistently trending higher, with this week’s volumes the highest recorded since April.  One year ago, a higher 950 Sydney homes were taken to auction returning a higher final success rate (74.5%). 

Across the smaller capital city markets, Canberra recorded a preliminary clearance rate of 84.9%, the highest of the smaller cities, Adelaide wasn’t far behind with 77.3% of homes selling at auction over the week.

"One of the lessons learned about the property market through COVID-19 is that listings numbers have been extremely responsive to changes in social distancing policies. 

Despite an extended lockdown, Melbourne is no exception. Since onsite, private inspections resumed on the 28th of September, new listings volumes have soared. The result is likely due to months of pent-up decisions to sell from vendors, and reflects how the real estate transaction process has remained tied to physical inspections. 

CoreLogic data shows the number of new listings, or the unique count of dwellings added to the market for sale, has increased around 330% in the four weeks ending 18th of October. This represents an increase in new listings volumes from 1,606 in the four weeks to September 20th, to 6,974 over the period to October 18th. 

This brings total advertised stock on market across Melbourne to just over 21,000 properties over the same period. 

A time series of the four week count of new listings across Melbourne is shown below. The trend over time shows new listings plummeting to levels below the New Year holiday period amid stage 3 and 4 restrictions. Following the 4 week period ending 27th of September, new listings have bounced significantly. 

 



After months of restrictions, pent-up demand from sellers has accumulated so much, that more stock was recently added for sale across Melbourne than any other capital city region.   
 



39 of 40 Melbourne SA3 regions  saw an increase in new listings over the past four weeks. Macedon Ranges was the only area to see a decline, with 7 fewer new listings added. 

A heat map of the increase in the number of new listings by Melbourne region is presented below. The median increase across regions was 139. The highest increase in new listings volumes was in Wyndham (314), Melbourne City (273) and the Whittlesea-Wallan region (256).



New listings: Good news or a sign of distress? 

A significant increase in new stock across Melbourne can mean different things for the state of the market. ‘Forced’ selling was a possibility from the pandemic, as significant job losses across Victoria may have limited the ability of some households to keep paying their mortgage. 

The latest financial stability review from the RBA noted that October was the period most mortgage deferrals were set to expire, which may have contributed to an increase in new listings in recent weeks. However, CoreLogic data does not point to a significant increase in mortgagee in possession events across Victoria.

A large increase in stock can also be a sign of a market on the rebound, as vendors choose to sell to meet rising demand. High buyer demand can also mitigate risk for distressed sales. 

One way to assess the state of the market through listings data is to observe how total listings volumes are tracking against new listings. New listings rose faster than total listings across Melbourne in the four weeks ending 18th of October. New stock added to market increased by around 5,370 properties, but the change in total stock was only 4,790. This suggests at least some stock on market has been absorbed over the past 4 weeks. 

Other metrics point to an improvement in market conditions. In the week ending 18th of October, the final auction clearance rate of 60.2% across Melbourne, was achieved alongside the highest volume of auctions seen in two months. Over the past month, the rate of decline across Melbourne dwelling values has also eased. 

It is clear that even after long, strict restrictions, vendors are keen to sell. However, due to the lag between an initial property listing and a sale, it will be a few weeks before we can understand how strong buyer appetite is. 

Originally posted on CoreLogic.",2021_04_23,22-Oct-20,N/A,"New listings soar across Melbourne, overtaking Sydney as restrictions ease"
"Plenty of data suggests certain rental markets have deteriorated amid the COVID-19 pandemic. CoreLogic data showed a 0.8% decline in national rent values from the end of March to the end of August, with more acute falls in the unit markets of Sydney and Melbourne, where rent values have fallen 4.2% and 4.4% respectively over the same period.

The closure of international borders has created a shock to rental demand, as most migrants rent when they initially come to Australia. An estimated 21.1% of payroll jobs have been lost across food and accommodation services since the onset of the pandemic, an industry where people are more likely to rent. The exposure of inner city areas to overseas migration, and inner-city workforces to accommodation and food services, has made these markets particularly susceptible to a rise in rental stock, and lower prices.  

But less data exists on the current dynamics between investors and landlords which is becoming increasingly important as we approach the expiry of a moratorium on evictions, which have already been extended in some states. CoreLogic conducted a survey of property managers, and other real estate professionals using the RP Data Professional platform. The survey provides some insight into rental conditions across the rental properties overseen by these professions. 

About the survey

Each survey question had an average of 169 respondents. Against the wider population of property professionals using the application, it suggests a margin of error in the responses of 7% at a 95% confidence interval. Respondents were surveyed over mid-to-late August. 
Of the respondents, the majority were located in the most populous states of Victoria, NSW and Queensland. Nearly half (48.6%) were real estate principals, while a further 35.8% were property managers. Across the larger states and territories, respondents by role were fairly uniform. 

Furthermore, respondents managed rental portfolios of varying sizes. The majority of respondents (60.3%) managed a large portfolio of 100 or more rental properties, while a further 14.4% managed between 50 and 99 properties. 
Key findings from the survey are presented below

A majority of agencies noted stable tenancy conditions, but a sizeable number saw increases in arrears, rent reduction requests and postponed payments

While the majority of respondents noted they had not seen a deterioration in rental conditions over the last two weeks, there is a sizable portion of agencies that had. Almost a third of real estate professionals had seen an increase in requests for rent reductions, over a quarter had seen an increase in rental delinquencies, and 8.8% had noted an increase in evictions. Of the real estate professionals who had noted an increase in rental delinquencies, 56.8% were based in Victoria, suggesting renewed restrictions across the state has impacted tenants’ ability to service rent.

A majority of agencies noted stable tenancy conditions, but a sizeable number saw increases in arrears, rent reduction requests and postponed payments

Despite almost a third of real estate professionals noting an increase in rent reduction requests across Australia, the highest number of respondents (48.5%) noted that in recent weeks, no landlords had agreed to a reduced rent paid by tenants. 
Of 83 respondents who had noted that none of the landlords had reduced rents, 66 had said this was less than, or about the same as, March this year. 

The second-highest response indicates that a relatively low portion of landlords had agreed to rental reductions (less than 25%). Of the 84 respondents that had indicated some landlords agreeing to reduce rental payments, 51 (60.7%) indicated that this was around the same proportion, or a slightly lower proportion, than in March. 

Rental delinquencies seem contained

Over August, 73.5% of respondents (125) had noted delinquencies in their portfolio. However, 66.5% of respondents indicated that less than 25% of their portfolios were in delinquency. 

Of the respondents that has noted delinquencies in their portfolio, 75.2% (94 respondents) suggested the portion of properties in delinquencies were the same, or smaller than in March, before the onset of COVID-19. This largely aligns with an earlier question in the survey, which found that around a quarter of respondents had seen an increase in delinquencies over the past few weeks. 

Of the 125 respondents that noted delinquencies, 72% indicated that on average, tenants were less than 4 weeks in arrears. However, over a fifth of respondents (22.4%) indicated that average arrears were more substantial, at 5 weeks to 3 months. 

Responses to the survey suggest that a more common occurrence in the rental market through COVID-19 has been the early termination of leases, rather than modifications to existing rental agreements. 

The relatively low level of property professionals that have observed an increase in evictions, a reduction in rents or a change in the state of arrears, supports other CoreLogic metrics about rental market deterioration being more localised. It is worth noting CoreLogic rental value data is based on advertised rental property rather than changes to existing leases, and may not directly capture leniency from landlords. However, a distressed rental market that saw rent reductions, early termination and evictions would presumably see an increase in vacant properties, indirectly lowering the price of advertised rental stock. 

Currently, newly listed properties are only showing more exaggerated declines around inner city areas. Rental listings data shows only 6 of 88 SA4 markets analysed saw an increase in total advertised stock since the start of the pandemic. 

Interestingly, the recently released GDP data showed an increase in household incomes of 2.2%. The increase is largely the result of JobKeeper and JobSeeker stimulus, which is set to taper at the end of the month. The end of this stimulus could see a broader decline in rental market conditions, particularly across Victoria where many businesses remain closed.

"A key takeaway from CoreLogic data amid the pandemic, is that transaction activity slows significantly in response to COVID-19 restrictions. The resulting loss of employment, lower consumer sentiment and border closures have had a much larger impact on the number of properties marketed and sold, than property prices themselves. 

This was seen from the Stage 2 restrictions implemented from the 25th of March. New listings fell 50.3% from mid-March to early May. This exacerbated the seasonal dip in for sale listings throughout March and April. 

However, as Melbourne reached the halfway mark of its Stage 4 restrictions in late August, national listings activity has completely diverged from the usual listings patterns in the lead up to spring. 

In the 4 years prior to the pandemic, the number of new properties listed for sale nationally has, on average, increased 6.3% between late July and late August. This year however, the equivalent period has seen a 9.6% decline in new listings nationally.
 
Unsurprisingly, this can be attributed to a sharp fall in new listings across Melbourne. The decline in new listings across Melbourne’s property market was 54.9% in the month to August 23rd, accounting for over 100% of the national decline. 

Conversely, most other capital cities saw an increase in new listings, as greater levels of consumer confidence, and lower levels of COVID-19 cases, saw vendors ramping up for the spring selling season. Across Sydney however, new listings had also started to slip marginally.

The severe drop-off in listings is validated by a fall in the number of comparative market analysis reports generated across CoreLogic platforms by real estate agents in Victoria. The average number of reports generated per week in Victoria fell 24.6% from July over the month of August to date. 

Why do transactions slow in times of strict social distancing

The reasons for slowed transaction activity during COVID restrictions are two-fold. The first is the physical limitation of buying and selling property under social distancing rules. Property sales may be less scalable as fewer people can physically inspect, show and value property.  

The second is the economic uncertainty generated by stage 4 lockdowns. As consumption falls and unemployment spikes, vendors feel less confident selling their property and getting their desired price. This is further supported by the close movement exhibited between sales volumes and the consumer sentiment index. Significant falls in monthly sales volumes have closely aligned with this indicator. 

The drop in sales volumes in times of high economic uncertainty, such as around the GFC and the national Stage 2 restrictions in March and April, indicates sellers and buyers are less likely to participate in property transactions during negative economic shocks or periods of heightened uncertainty. 

Additionally, a vital part of the tight lid on new listings has been mortgage repayment deferral offerings from banks. This has meant that people who cannot currently service their mortgage do not have to list as a distressed or motivated seller. This dynamic may change in the lead up to March, when banks may need to end repayment deferrals. 

Property owners who have deferred their mortgages, but are not in a position to reinstate their repayments by the end of March, may decide to offload their property in the lead up to this expiry date. It’s reasonable to expect mortgage arrears will increase from currently low levels, which could gradually see a larger number of distressed listings come on the market.

Industry should brace for a subdued selling season

The intention to sell and buy property is evidently linked to consumer confidence, which in turn has been influenced by case numbers of COVID-19, and the stringency of government response in impacting economic activity. 

The initial restrictions through March and April saw a sharp drop in listings nationally, but these recovered quickly. A similar pattern was seen in sales volumes. The low cost of debt and strong recovery in consumer confidence created pent-up demand for property as Australia got ahead of the virus curve. This was perhaps one of the few ‘V-shaped’ recoveries observed amid the pandemic. 

However, once restrictions are repealed in Melbourne this time around, the recovery in transaction activity is likely to be weaker. 

That is because employment is taking another hit, consumer sentiment is dampened by the reality of a second outbreak of the virus, and a reduction in fiscal support is only a month away. Ultimately, the second round of restrictions across Victoria is likely to create a weaker ‘spring selling season’ than in previous years. ",2021_04_23,4-Sep-20,N/A,COVID-19 Creates An Unusual Start To The Spring Selling Season
"Not every Australian housing market has performed the same way since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest CoreLogic Home Value Index results revealed that since March, Melbourne property values fell 3.5%. Meanwhile, the ACT dwelling market reached a record high. From June to July, the rate of decline eased across Perth from -1.1% to -0.6%, but deepened across Melbourne and Sydney.  

The chart above shows the varied trajectories of capital city markets from the end of March. The end of March is a good place for dating the ‘start’ of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, because Australia recorded its 100th case of COVID-19 on the 14th of the month, and the 25th of March saw the national rollout of stage 2 restrictions, which created much of the economic shock as business activity slowed. 

Melbourne has so far seen the largest cumulative declines in property values since March (3.5%). This was led by a 5.2% decline across the Inner East region. 

As has been explored in recent weeks, the steeper decline across the Melbourne market is two-fold. Cyclically, Melbourne property is subject to more volatile growth rates, and is also presenting strong declines off the back of very high growth rates through the previous upswing. Structurally, there has been an enormous demand shock to the Melbourne property market with the closure of international borders, where Melbourne previously had the highest level of net overseas migration of the capital city markets. 

This is similar to the Sydney housing market, which received the second highest volume of net interstate migrants over 2018-19.
Victoria has also seen the largest decline in payroll jobs of the states and territories, according to ABS data.  

Conversely, the ACT has seen property value increases of 1.3% since March. While the performance of the ACT market may seem like an anomaly, the ACT dwelling market is one of the few markets performing as may be expected amid the record low cash rate setting. RBA research has noted that reductions in the cash rate typically increase property values over time, because debt becomes cheaper and purchasing capacity increases. 

However, it is still striking that 70% of food and accommodation employers reported a reduction in staff hours. Food and accommodation employs about 8% of Australians, or about 1.2 million people.
 
This is where a more granular view of employment data can highlight risks to the property market. The detailed quarterly survey data provides insight into what industry residents work in, at the SA4 level. 

The February edition suggests that most food and accommodation workers are highly concentrated in Sydney’s Inner West, followed by the Sunshine Coast and the Coffs Harbour-Grafton region. 
This market has likely been buoyed by the relative stability in employment across sectors where workers are on higher incomes, and are more likely to be home owners or prospective buyers. For example, ABS payroll data shows the number of jobs across the financial and insurance industry in the ACT has actually increased 0.7% since the start of the pandemic. A ‘two tiered’ state of the labour market is highlighted by the fact the ACT accommodation and food services sector has seen the largest rate of decline of the states and territories. This industry is more likely to be comprised of renters, and rental values have fallen half a percent across the ACT since March, with larger falls across the unit sector (-1.0%). 


Smaller housing markets have seen better capital growth results since March. Adelaide is a relatively steady market that has traditionally not seen volatile movements in response to negative economic shocks. This may be partly to do with the relatively low level of investment activity across the market. CoreLogic estimates that the portion of dwellings across Adelaide that were owned by investors as of July 2020 was 28.9%, compared with 34.5% nationally. 

While Adelaide has seen modest growth during the pandemic, this has not traditionally been a market with strong capital growth returns. Annualised growth across Adelaide dwellings over the past 10 years was 1.3%, compared with 3.0% across the combined capital cities market.  

It is also worth noting that while cumulative price changes show 4 of the 8 capital city markets have not declined in value since March, almost all markets are showing a slowdown in growth rates. This suggests that, as with past downturns, most housing markets will be subject to a downswing phase. 

What to expect going forward

Looking forward, there are a variety of factors that will influence the outlook for home values. Of immediate concern is the steepening curve of the virus in Victoria.  Considering Victoria accounts for around one quarter of the nation’s economy, the stage-four lockdown has already dampened both consumer and business sentiment nationally and the interruption to economic activity will deepen and lengthen Australia’s recession. Cities where labour markets are more impacted are also likely to under-perform, as will those with more significant exposure to overseas migration as a source of housing demand.

As federal government fiscal support moves from around $18 billion per month to around $3 billion from October, housing market conditions will be tested more broadly; this is when we are likely to see a rise in the number of households facing financial distress and a lift in urgent sales. The expiry of mortgage repayment holidays is another downside factor for the market.  Pre-COVID, mortgage arrears remained around 1% of the mortgage book, but with unemployment expected to reach 10%, along with less fiscal support and an expectation that mortgagors taking a repayment holiday will need to face up to their debts by April next year, it’s reasonable to expect a sharp rise in mortgage arrears which could see a lift in distressed properties hitting the market. 

The RBA has previously noted for every 1 per cent rise in the unemployment rate, 90 day mortgage arrears generally increase by 80 basis points.  If unemployment rises to 10%, that implies a 90 day mortgage arrears rate around 5%.  Arguably, this may be an overstatement, considering weak labour market conditions are skewed to more casualised workers who tend to be renters rather than home owners.
The outlook for both the economy and housing markets remains extremely uncertain, but risk remains skewed to the downside.",2021_04_23,6-Aug-20,N/A,Why Have The Capital Cities Performed Differently Amid COVID-19?
"On the 27th of July, the New South Wales government announced eligible first home buyers could access stamp duty exemptions on new home purchases worth up to $800,000.  

New home builds will also see stamp duty discounts available for purchases between $800,000 and $1 million, where the discount reduces with a higher purchasing price.

The policy is a temporary, 12-month extension of existing stamp duty concessions from the 1st of August 2020.
 
Based on housing market trends that emerged from the initial introduction of stamp duty discounts and other first home buyer incentives, there a few trends we may expect to emerge from the new round of stamp duty discounts.

First home buyer demand will increase over the year

Previous research suggests that first home buyer grants and incentives have had a ‘vacuum’ effect, where first home buyer incentives are followed by large, but temporary, spikes in first home buyer activity. This suggests the incentives bring forward purchases that may have happened anyway. The fact that the new stamp duty discounts on offer will only be available for 12 months is likely to exacerbate this effect. 

The increase in first home buyer participation over a limited time window may actually lead to an increase in values up to the cut off values for stamp duty concessions. This is because buyer competition could be increased in this segment while added incentives are on offer. Furthermore, the reduced transaction costs associated with stamp duty exemptions mean borrowers have higher purchasing capacity, which may just be added onto the purchase price while first home buyer demand is elevated. 

One important mitigating factor is that the demand shock created by COVID-19 may not be enough to increase first home buyer demand, but at the very least, first home buyer participation may be higher than it otherwise would have been as a result of the stamp duty discount.  

Price clustering could move up to the $800,000 mark

Research of sales volumes by price suggests that sales volumes tend to ‘cluster’ just under the cut-off point for complete stamp duty exemptions, so that first home buyers can avoid paying the tax. 

CoreLogic sales volume data across NSW shows that there is a bunching of sales between the $640,000 and $650,000 price point between July 2017 and June 2020. $650,000 was the cut off point for stamp duty exemption for first home buyers in this period. 

This is demonstrated in the charts below, which show the volume of sales across NSW by value range for the two years before and after the introduction of stamp duty discounts for sales up to $650,000.

While the $650,000 price point seemed to be an anchoring point for buyers before the introduction of stamp duty exemptions, the difference in sales volumes is exacerbated after exemptions are introduced. The number of sales at $640-650,000 was 32% higher than the band below, and is 49% higher than sales in the value band above. This is a greater divergence than was observed between these value bands in the two years before the introduction of stamp duty exemptions. 

 As the stamp duty exemption increases to $800,000, this could see a broader range of properties increase in value up to this level. This price inflation would be skewed toward new home builds where the discounts apply.  

The incentive to avoid tax could increase turnover now, but dampen it later

An interesting feature of the stamp duty discounts for first home buyers is that they extend to property values worth up to $1 million.
 
This is likely to be beyond the typical first home buyer purchase point across NSW. Deriving the average borrowing amount by first home buyers from ABS housing finance data suggests that a typical first home buyer purchase price averaged closer to $625,000 between July 2019 and May 2020.

By raising the threshold to $1 million, there is more diversity in the housing stock that first home buyers can access with stamp duty discounts, particularly across Sydney where property values are higher than in other capital cities. 

But by incentivising first home buyers into a more expensive, and presumably larger home earlier in life, first home buyers may stay put for longer, in order to avoid paying stamp duty on upsizing down the line. This could extend hold periods, thus potentially reducing the amount of turnover that takes place in future. 

Overall, the expected impact of this temporary discount in stamp duty should bring forward the purchase of property among first home buyers, and skew more first home buyers to new property. This is good news for those in the construction industry, and, considering the broad range of industry sectors involved in residential construction, there should be a positive flow through to economic activity.  However, considering the potential for higher housing prices, stamp duty exemptions may be limited in helping first home buyers access cheaper housing.

"The onset of COVID-19 may be creating a two-speed rental market, with inner-city rents declining faster than those in the outer suburbs. CoreLogic data confirms that there is a positive correlation between changes in rent values and distance to the CBD. This means that the closer a region is to the CBD, the more likely it is that rent values have fallen.

CoreLogic rent values were analysed across SA3 regions of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. For each region, the median property distance to the CBD was compared with the change in total rental market values from the end of March (which marked national, stage 2 restrictions) to the end of August.

The results are plotted below. Each graph shows the change in rent values for houses and units across the horizontal axis between March and August, and the distance to the CBD along the horizontal axis.

 

 

 

Why have inner city markets been more affected?

As has been noted in previous research from CoreLogic, there are several distinct factors of the COVID-19 downturn that have made inner city rental markets particularly susceptible to a decline in rental values.

These include the relatively high exposure to overseas migration as a source of housing demand. A summary of average net overseas migration alongside distance to CBD is presented by SA3 region below. 

 

Where have rents increased?

Of the 125 SA3 rental markets analysed, there were 63 regions where house rents increased, and 35 regions where unit rents increased, since the end of March to August. 
Rental increases were most common across Sydney and Brisbane, where employment has been less affected by the pandemic, and social distancing measures have eased. The highest rental value increases were across Blue Mountains houses, rising 3.3%. 

The reason for rental value increases in outer-suburban areas are less clear. On explanation may be that outer-city suburbs have been less exposed to the factors driving declines in demand, such as overseas migration. Anecdotal reports assert that a draw card for outer-city suburbs are relatively cheap rents, and low density along with remote working lessening the hurdle of travel times from areas located furhte form the largest employment nodes. This may have increased rental prices through higher demand. The analysed data set also revealed that rental value increases have occurred in cheaper rental markets. However, it is difficult to understand this trend without survey data, and internal migration data for the COVID period will likely not be available until April next year.

It may also be the case that added stimulus to low income households have added to rental demand in areas where rents are usually cheaper. The tapering of this fiscal support may lead to a more broad-based decline in rents over the next 6 months.

"When discussing housing affordability older Australian tend to point to much higher interest rates in the past as being a challenge while for younger Australians, higher property values are seen as the biggest barrier to home ownership. The truth of the matter is it is much more nuanced than this, but on balance I would say it is much harder to break into the housing market now than it has been in the past but it is not due to much higher property values alone. Let’s take a look why.

Although dwelling values have reduced over recent years, housing is in most instances (much) more expensive than it has been in the past. While this is an important consideration it is not the be all and end all.

One of the commonly repeated memes is that interest rates were high in the early 1990s thus making buying a home difficult. What probably made buying a home more difficult at time was the fact that the unemployment rate reached as high as 11.2% compared to the 5.2% today however, once again it is a bit more nuanced than that. When unemployment peaked, the male workforce participation rate was 73.8% which is actually higher than it currently is (70.9%) while the female participation rate was 51.9% compared to the historic high of 61.1% it is currently. Furthermore, although the unemployment rate peaked at 11.2% in December 1992, the underemployment rate at that time was 7.8% compared to the 8.9% it is currently. Delving a little deeper to look at underemployment for those likely to be saving for a mortgage, the underemployment rate in December 1992 for 15-24 year olds and 25-34 year olds was 13.3% and 6.7% respectively in 1992 compared to 20.7% and 7.2% respectively today. Although the unemployment rate was much higher in 1992 than it is today, there were fewer females in the workforce. Individuals that had a job were more likely to be getting as many hours as they wanted compared to today’s workers, particularly younger workers, the ones most likely to be trying to save a home deposit. The fact that female participation has lifted so much over recent years also points to the fact that saving for and paying off a mortgage increasingly requires more than one income.

Another factor pointing to entering the housing market being more or just as difficult in the past as it is today is the higher interest rates in the early 1990s. If you had a mortgage at that time that was certainly a somewhat difficult time however, if you were saving for a deposit at that time you were also receiving substantially higher rates of interest on your savings. When standard variable mortgage rates for owner-occupiers hit their peak at 17% between June 1989 and March 1990, 12 month term deposit rates for savers hit as high as 16% but ranged from 14.2% to 16.0%. Today, standard variable mortgage rates are recorded at 4.94% and 12 month term deposit rates are 1.65%. Both are at historic lows however, the gap between the term deposit and variable mortgage rate is only slightly lower than its historic high and much larger than it was in the past. While a current potential buyer may be looking to save for the mortgage, they aren’t getting the assistance from higher interest rates that they may have in the past.

Inflation is also a key consideration in this discussion. Inflation is at record low levels currently and was much higher in the past. While many people tend to not consider it, higher inflation is typically accompanied by higher interest rates but equally if the cost of everything is increasing more rapidly, it results in the erosion of the real value of a mortgage. Given this, higher inflation should lead to mortgagees being able to pay off their mortgage quicker. While this doesn’t necessarily impact on those people saving for a deposit it does mean that once they take out a mortgage, paying it off is relatively easier with higher inflation than it is with lower inflation.

Saving a deposit for a mortgage has always been difficult. When I first took out a mortgage I was lucky that my parents were able to assist. Equally, when my parents first took out a mortgage in the 1970s they had parental assistance and my children will most likely need assistance from my wife and me. Unfortunately, not everyone is in a position to receive the same assistance and when you look holistically at the current factors of high property values, insecure employment, low inflation and subsequently low interest rates, I think it is more difficult than it has ever been to save for a mortgage. Supporting this opinion is the fact that the share of households that are renting continues to rise while the share of owner-occupier households both with or without a mortgage continues to fall.

Improving access to potential first home buyers is extremely difficult, with grants tending to push values higher but it is clear something needs to be done. Unfortunately, falling dwelling values have broader repercussions for the economy because so much household wealth is tied to housing. Ideally, after recent value declines we see the housing market show modest gains over the coming years which would continue to gradually improve affordability over time. In saying this, it still doesn’t really address the challenge that saving a deposit continues to be the biggest hurdle and low interest rates look to be in place for a number of years to come.",2021_04_23,2-Sep-19,N/A,Saving For A Mortgage Deposit Now Is More Difficult Than It Has Ever Been
"Lending data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed that in May 2019 demand for mortgages continued to fall.  Over the month, there was $24.8 billion worth of housing finance commitments which was -1.5% lower than the previous month and -17.1% lower year-on-year.  The $24.8 billion in commitments over the month was the lowest value since September 2013.

The $24.8 billion was split between $18.1 billion in commitments to owner-occupiers and $6.8 billion worth of commitments to investors.  Over the month, the value of lending to owner-occupiers fell by -1.7% while the value of lending to investors was -1.0% lower.    

Year-on-year the value of lending to owner-occupiers was -14.8% lower while the value of lending to investors fell by a larger -22.7%.  Lending to owner-occupiers peaked in January 2018, while lending for investment purposes peaked much earlier in April 2015.  Since those peaks, the value of lending to owner-occupiers has dropped by -16.0% while investor mortgage demand has fallen much further, down -45.9% from its peak.

Lending is comprised of new lending and refinanced lending; the above chart highlights the value of lending to owner-occupiers and investors split between new lending and refinanced loans. As the chart shows, in the current environment refinance demand is holding up much better than new lending demand. This reflects both the tougher lending rules that are affecting new mortgage demand and the intense competition among lenders which is prompting borrowers to shop around for the best rates. For owner-occupiers the value of lending for refinances is -7.0% lower year-on-year compared to an -18.0% fall for new lending. Similarly, the value of refinance commitments to investors is -11.6% lower year-on-year compared to a -27.8% slump in commitment for new investor loans.

One area of strength in the mortgage lending market has been first home buyers. Falling values has improved housing affordability and different incentives offered across the states and territories have led to increased participation from the first home buyer segment. In May 2019, there were 9,605 housing finance commitments to owner-occupier first home buyers, the highest monthly number since November 2018. In terms of the share of total new lending to owner-occupiers, first home buyers accounted for 28.5% of all lending over the month, its highest share since September 2012. The number and proportion of first home buyers remain well below peaks, however this segment of the market has seen a sustained improvement over the past two years as dwelling values have fallen and stamp duty incentive went live in NSW and Vic.

"An emerging narrative around regional dwelling markets is that they may see increased demand as a result of COVID-19.  

This is thought to be driven by the way the pandemic has forcibly introduced remote work for knowledge-based or clerical workers. As employers and employees adapt to remote working conditions, physical proximity to a workplace may become a less important factor in home purchases.

In the June 2020 quarter, about 3 months into the engineered economic slowdown, CoreLogic data showed regional centres have seen higher capital growth than the capital city regions. The charts below show the rolling quarterly growth of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, alongside quarterly growth of nearby major regional centres. 

 This more positive outcome is short term, and is more likely tied to cyclical patterns than changes in demographic trends, which are typically a gradual phenomenon. The charts demonstrate that even though regional centres have not seen price falls in the June quarter, growth rates have seen a slowdown in momentum.

Regional growth rates peaked around late 2019, and could nudge into negative territory later this year without significant improvement to economic conditions or a demonstrated shift in demand side factors like population growth. 

Illawarra and Newcastle, and Geelong and Ballarat, also saw a relatively weak upswing compared with the Sydney and Melbourne markets over the second half of 2019. The relative stability of growth rates mean that these regional centres may not see as deep a downswing in the coming months.  

COVID-19 and long term demographic trends

Regional Australia is considered appealing for relatively low levels of density, less congestion, and typically lower price points for property. The median dwelling value for combined regional areas of Australia was $394,570 at June 2020, 38.5% lower than the combined capital city median of $641,671.

One way to assess whether COVID-19 could exacerbate a tree-change or sea-change trend, is to examine population movements before the onset of the pandemic. ABS internal migration data at the SA4 level sheds some light on this.

Areas with the highest levels of net internal migration over 2018-19 (where more people moved to an area from another part of Australia than departed it) are shown below. These include the Capital Region of regional NSW, the Sunshine Coast, Melbourne – West, the Gold Coast and Ipswich.  
 

 

From these examples, there was already a trend of movement from more suburban or metropolitan areas to regional areas. 

But two of the highest levels of net internal migration are actually still within capital city bounds. Melbourne – West and Ipswich are technically in greater capital city regions, but see a large number of migrants from the inner city. 

This may reflect both availability of developable land transitioning to large greenfield housing estates as well as cohorts such as inner-city renters and first home buyers making the transition to buy in more affordable areas that are still commutable to the CBD.

That is an important trend to consider, because it is a scenario where past migration may have been driven by affordability instead of preference for a regional lifestyle. If that is the case, a mitigating factor to the draw of regional areas during COVID-19, is that dwellings closer to the city are also becoming cheaper, which may slow migration to the city fringe.

But affordability is not the only drawcard of regional Australia. Parts of regional Australia may offer lower levels of population density, which is arguably desirable in the wake of a pandemic. There have also been recent examples of people departing from higher socio-economic areas to parts of regional Australia. Over 2018-19,  an estimated 1,453 residents form the Sydney - Eastern Suburbs region departed for areas such as the Central Coast, Richmond-Tweed and the Gold Coast. 

The normalisation of remote work amid COVID-19 is more likely to bolster regional migration than slow it. But in the wake of the pandemic, the return to an office environment may still be desirable for some employees and employers. 

Furthermore, it is important to note that the broad-based impact to housing demand from the pandemic could see prices fall in regional centres over the second half of 2020. Price falls are unlikely to be as sharp as what will be observed in capital city markets, where more expensive, capital city markets have historically shown more volatility than regional Australia.

"There were fewer homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, as the nation stopped amidst the Federal election hype. Of the 917 homes that did go to auction this week, preliminary results show that 57 per cent were successful.  Over the week prior, 1,218 homes were auctioned and the final auction clearance rate came in at 54 per cent; the highest final result since September last year.  Comparing results from the same week last year, a higher 2,100 homes were taken to auction returning a 56.8 per cent final clearance rate.

In Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 62.9 per cent was recorded across 427 auctions this week, making it the best performing auction market according to preliminary figures. Last week there were a higher 546 auctions held across the city returning a final clearance rate of 55.7 per cent. This time last year, 1,033 auctions were held across the city, returning a final clearance rate of 62 per cent. 
 

 

There were 270 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary clearance rate of 60.7 per cent. Last week, a higher 445 homes were taken to auction returning a 59 per cent final auction clearance rate.  Sydney’s final clearance rate has come in at the high 50 per cent range for the last 2 weeks, as final collection comes in this week we will see if this was maintained for another week. The last time Sydney’s clearance rate was in the high 50’s was mid-May last year.

Looking at the smaller auction markets, Canberra came in with the strongest preliminary result with 56 per cent of homes selling at auction this week, while only 25 per cent of homes in Perth sold.

"This week’s Property Pulse pairs the run rate of settled sales transactions with the volume of stock advertised for sale, determining how many months of housing supply is currently advertised for sale across the capital cities.

The months of supply metric measures the volume of stock advertised for sale against the run rate of settled sales. The result, expressed in months, provides an indication about how long it would take the market to absorb all the residential properties that are advertised for sale.

Across the combined capital cities, there is currently 5.3 months of housing supply available for sale; if no more properties were advertised for sale, it would take 5.3 months for current advertised supply to be purchased.  As the first chart shows, for this time of year, this is the highest months of supply figure any time since 2012.  To put the figure into context, at the same time last year there was a much lower 3.9 months of supply.  The lift in months of supply is a function of a lift in the amount of stock available for sale and the ongoing fall in transaction volumes.

There is currently 4.1 months of housing stock available for sale in Sydney.  Although that still may seem like quite a low supply of stock for sale, in comparison to the previous 7 years, the months of supply figure is now the highest it has been at this time of year any time over that period.  Months of supply is elevated due to much lower transaction volumes and an elevated volume of stock for sale.

In Melbourne there is currently 5.9 months of housing supply for sale.  Although that figure has reduced slightly over recent weeks it is still currently higher than over the same period during any of the previous 7 years.  Much like Sydney, a much slower rate of sale and much higher stock for sale has led to the heightened supply.

There is currently 5.9 months of housing supply for sale in Brisbane which is the highest for this time of year since 2012.  The elevated volume of stock for sale coupled with falling transaction volumes are the factors driving the heightened supply.  Although stock is elevated relative to recent years it has been fairly steady at 5.9 months over recent weeks.

Months of supply in Adelaide is trending higher, transaction volumes are steady if not slightly higher than a year ago however, the volumes of stock for sale is much higher.  There is currently 3.8 months of supply on the market and although that figure is lower than most other capital cities it is slightly higher than at the same time last year (3.7 months).

The ongoing weak housing conditions in Perth whereby values and transaction volumes continue to fall and stock for sale mounts has led to further increases in months of supply.  At 7.7 months of supply, supply is the highest it has been at this time of year, any year since 2012.  7.7 months of supply is also one of the highest amongst all capital cities.

A major contributor to the surge in dwelling values in Hobart over recent years has been the lack of stock for sale.  More recently the volume of stock for sale has risen however, it remains quite low reflected by the fact there is just 2.8 months of supply on the market currently.  Although that figure is low, it is higher than at the same time last year (2.0 months) and 2017 (2.7 months) but it remains much lower than previous years.

The months of supply for sale in Darwin is higher than any other capital city at 9.0 months.  Darwin has a high supply of stock for sale and low rate of sale resulting in the high months of supply.  Despite the high figure, it is actually lower than it was at the same time of year for each of the past three years.

Canberra currently has 3.6 months of housing supply advertised for sale.  Although that is a comparatively low figure, months of supply in Canberra hasn’t been as high as it is currently since 2013.  Like most other capital cities, months of supply is elevated due to a heightened volume of stock for sale with sales actually higher than they were 12 months ago.

The months of supply figure highlights why the housing market is generally falling.  Credit conditions are tight which means fewer buyers and generally leads to a slower rate of sales.  Although vendors have responded by bringing fewer new properties to the market, total stock for sale remains elevated leading to a heightened months of supply figure.

"There were 2,041 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week after the previous week saw volumes drop to 930, likely due to the federal election. This time last year, volumes were higher with 2,297 auctions held. 

Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 62.6 per cent across the combined capital cities this week although we will see some downwards revision over the week. Last week’s final clearance rate came in at 55.2 per cent, the highest clearance rate we have seen since September last year and it’s possible that this week’s final clearance rate may top that as remaining results roll in. Over the same week last year the final clearance rate was recorded at 56.2 per cent. 
 

 

In Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 62.9 per cent was recorded across 971 auctions this week, while last week there were 432 auctions returning a final clearance rate of 60.7 per cent. This time last year, 1,132 auctions were held across the city, returning a clearance rate of 59.0 per cent. 

There were 697 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary clearance rate of 69.9 per cent. In comparison, there were just 276 auctions held over the previous week returning a final clearance rate of 56.5 per cent. There is a chance that this week’s final clearance rate may just be able to hold above 60 per cent after Sydney has seen the final clearance rate sit above 55 per cent for the last 3 weeks. One year ago, 814 auctions were held across the city and the clearance rate came in at 56.1 per cent. 

Weekly Clearance Rate, Combined Capital Cities

 

Looking at the smaller auction markets, auction volumes increased week-on-week across all capital cities. Preliminary results show that clearance rates were down slightly over the week in Brisbane, while all other cities saw an increase week-on-week.

"There were 1,210 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 58.1 per cent. Last week, a higher 1,479 auctions were held and the final clearance rate increased to 52.5 per cent; the second highest clearance rate seen over the year-to-date. Compared to last year, volumes continue to trend lower each week, with almost double the volume of homes taken to auction over the same week in 2018 (2,279) when 58.2 per cent sold.
 

 

Although the clearance rate will adjust lower on the full set of results,  the trend over the past two months has seen final auction clearance rates holding around the low-to-mid 50 per cent range and we expect a similar finalised result this week.  While the trend in auction clearance rates certainly aren’t  describing strong market conditions, with the success rate holding around ten percentage points higher than late last year, it reflects a better fit between buyer and seller expectations on prices.  

In Melbourne, Australia’s largest auction market, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 56.8 per cent was recorded across 545 auctions this week, up slightly from the 56.6 per cent final clearance rate last week when a higher 672 homes were auctioned. One year ago, the clearance rate was a stronger 77.5 per cent across 1,099 auctions.

Weekly Clearance Rate, Combined Capital Cities

There were 441 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 65.6 per cent; the strongest preliminary result across the capital cities, compared to 57.2 per cent across 539 last week, and 57.5 per cent across 787 auctions one year ago. 

Across the smaller auction markets, preliminary results show that Perth was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with 53.8 per cent of auctions successful, however there was only 18 auctions held across the city. Brisbane was the worst performing auction market this week according to preliminary results with 83 homes auctioned and 39.2 per cent clearing.

"There were 1,472 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, increasing from 1,026 over the previous week, although much lower than this week last year (2,311). 

Preliminary results show an auction clearance rate of 58.8 per cent across the combined capitals, increasing from last week’s final clearance rate of 50.4 per cent, while this week last year the clearance rate was recorded at 62.1 per cent. Once final results are collected, the final clearance rate will most likely revise down to the low 50 per cent range.
 

 

In Melbourne, 678 homes were taken to auction this week, increasing from 498 over the previous week. This week last year saw 1,144 homes taken to auction across the city. The preliminary auction clearance rate came in at 60.8 per cent this week, up from 53.6 per cent over the previous week, although lower than this time last year (63.7 per cent).

Sydney was host to 535 auctions this week with preliminary results returning a 66.6 per cent clearance rate across 326 results. Over the previous week, 332 auctions were held across the city and a final clearance rate of 52.4 per cent was recorded. This time last year, 63.1 per cent of the 797 Sydney homes auctioned were successful. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Brisbane was the only city to see a fall in both auction volumes and the clearance rate week-on-week, while year-on-year, all capital cities saw a fall in auction volumes.

"Dwelling values across Australia continued their downward trajectory in April, falling by half a percent over the month to be down -7.2% over the past twelve months and -7.9% lower since peaking in September 2017. Although housing values are broadly trending lower, the rate of decline has been easing since moving through a monthly low point in December last year when national dwelling values fell -1.1%.

 

According to CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless, “The improvement in the rate of decline is attributable to an easing in the market downturn across Sydney and Melbourne where values were previously falling much faster. In December last year, Sydney dwelling values were down -1.8%, with the pace of month-on-month falls progressively moderating back to -0.7% in April. Similarly, Melbourne values were down -1.5% in December, with the rate of decline improving to -0.6% in April.“

Other property market insights supporting a subtle improvement in housing market conditions include a rise in mortgage related valuations activity (as indicated by CoreLogic platform data), an improvement in ABS household finance data for February, and the fact that auction clearance rates are holding around the mid-50% range across the major auction markets. Tim Lawless said, “While none of these indicators could be described as strong, the current trend in the data implies that housing market conditions may have moved through the worst of the downturn.”

 

 

In April, dwelling values fell across every capital city apart from Canberra, while regional areas of Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia also avoided a fall. The broad-based nature of lower housing values highlights that while the rate of decline has eased, the geographic scope of lower dwelling values remains broad.

Values were down by -0.9% in Hobart, signaling a weakening across what has been one of the strongest capital city markets for value gains and leaving Canberra as the only capital city where dwelling values were up over the month.

Annually, national dwelling values were down -7.2%; the largest annual fall since the twelve months ending February 2009, which was associated with the Global Financial Crisis. 

Across the capital cities, Sydney (-10.9%) and Melbourne (-10.0%) are both now recording double-digit annual declines, followed by Perth (-8.3%) and Darwin (-7.1%). The largest gains are in Hobart (+3.8%) and Canberra (+2.5%), while Adelaide is the only other capital city to remain in the black over the past twelve months (+0.3%).

"The weighted average preliminary clearance rate rose across a higher volume of auctions this week with 1,019 homes taken to market returning a 54.6 per cent success rate. The higher activity this week comes off the back of the Easter period slowdown which saw only 394 auctions held across the capitals and a 43.9 per cent final auction clearance rate, which was the second lowest clearance rate over the year to date.  
 

 

Looking at results by property type, 56.8 per cent of houses sold at auction this week, which was higher than units which returned a 49.6 per cent clearance rate.

Across Australia’s two largest cities, there were 497 Melbourne homes taken to auction this week, increasing on the 50 homes auctioned last week, however the higher volumes saw the preliminary clearance rate drop to 55.7 per cent, after last week’s 63.2 per cent final clearance rate. 
 

 

In Sydney, 329 auctions were held this week returning a 57.1 per cent preliminary clearance rate, improving on the 46.3 per cent final auction clearance rate last week when a lower 221 auctions were held across the city.

All of the remaining auction markets saw an increase in auction activity this week with the exception of Canberra where volumes were lower. The performance however was varied, with Adelaide recording the highest success rate of 54.8 per cent, while only 20 per cent of auctions cleared in Perth.

"There were 2,268 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, increasing from 1,976 over the previous week and 1,915 over the same week last year. This was the last week of auctions before the Easter weekend slowdown and while volumes have increased week-on-week, they are significantly lower than the week prior to Easter 2018 when 3,990 homes were taken to auction; the busiest week for auctions on record. 
 

 

Although the number of auctions remain well below the week prior to Easter last year, the number of auctions held was the second highest so far this year.

Preliminary results show an auction clearance rate of 58.2 per cent across the combined capitals, although keep in mind that this will revise lower as the remaining results are collected. The previous week saw the final clearance rate hold above 50 per cent for the 4th consecutive week (52.6 per cent), while this week last year the clearance rate was recorded at 61.7 per cent. 

 

 

In Melbourne, 939 homes were taken to auction this week, increasing from both the previous week (892) and this week last year (873). In comparison, the week prior to Easter 2018 saw 2,071 homes taken to auction across the city. The preliminary auction clearance rate came in at 54.9 per cent this week, down from 55.4 per cent over the previous week and 62.4 per cent this time last year.

Sydney was host to 927 auctions this week with preliminary results returning a 62.9 per cent clearance rate across 577 results. Over the previous week, 742 auctions were held across the city and a final clearance rate of 54.9 per cent was recorded. This time last year, 61.5 per cent of the 795 Sydney homes auctioned were successful. The week prior to Easter 2018 saw 1,383 homes taken to auction across the city. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Perth was the only city to see a fall in auction volumes week-on-week. Year-on-year all capital cities saw an increase in auction volumes except Canberra where auction volumes were unchanged.

"This week 1,978 auctions were held across the combined capital cities, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 57.2 per cent. Over the previous week, a final clearance rate of 50.9 per cent across 2,164 auctions was recorded making it the third consecutive week where the clearance rate has held above 50 per cent. This week will likely see a similar outcome as remaining results are collected. Over the same week last year, auction volumes were slightly lower (1,839), however the clearance rate was stronger at 62.8 per cent.

 

Melbourne was host to 899 auctions this week with preliminary results returning a 58.1 per cent clearance rate. Over the previous week, 978 auctions were held across the city with the final clearance rate coming in at 52.1 per cent. This time last year, 723 homes were taken to auction and a final clearance rate of 68.2 per cent was recorded.

In Sydney, 740 homes were taken to auction this week, down from 801 last week. The preliminary clearance rate came in at 61.9 per cent this week, increasing from 54.3 per cent last week however as usual this will revise lower over the week. The final clearance rate in Sydney has held above 52 per cent for the last 5 weeks so it will be interesting to see if this continues once the remaining results are collected. One year ago, a clearance rate of 62.9 per cent was recorded across 795 auctions. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Canberra, Perth and Tasmania saw an increase in the number of homes taken to auction this week, while Adelaide and Brisbane saw lower volumes week-on-week.

"There were 2,155 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, with preliminary results showing a 56.8 per cent success rate. This is the third consecutive week where the preliminary clearance rate has been in the 56 per cent range so it is likely that we will see revision down to the low 50’s as final results are collected which is what we have seen over the last two weeks. 

Through March the largest auction markets have seen the clearance rate holding around the mid-to-low 50% range which is lower than the same time last year, but a substantial improvement relative to late 2018. While there has clearly been a seasonal bounce in the clearance rate, auction results are holding reasonably firm on higher volumes. The number of auctions is likely to rise further in the lead up to Easter; if we see the clearance rate continuing to hold around the mid-to-low 50% range it will be a strong sign that the fit between buyer and seller pricing expectations is becoming more balanced.
 

 

Last week, 1,667 auctions were held and the final clearance rate came in at 50.9 per cent. Over the same week last year, auction volumes were significantly lower due to the Easter weekend with just 670 homes going under the hammer across the combined capital cities, although the clearance rate was a stronger 64.8 per cent.
 
In Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 53.4 per cent was recorded across 991 auctions this week, down from 55.1 per cent across 814 auctions over the previous week. Last week’s clearance rate was the highest the city had seen since September 2018. Over the same week last year, just 152 homes were taken to auction across the city, returning a clearance rate of 65.5 per cent. 
 

Sydney was host to 789 auctions this week, with preliminary results showing a 65.9 per cent success rate, compared to 52.1 per cent across 506 auctions last week. This time last year, the clearance rate was a stronger 67.9 per cent across 394 auctions. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Brisbane was the only city to see an increase in the number of homes taken to auction this week, while all other cities saw lower volumes week-on-week.

"The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released their September 2018 quarter demographic data last week.  In this week’s Pulse we take a look at the arrivals and departures data across the states.

 

Each quarter the ABS publishes demographic data that measures the size of the Australian population and provides details on components of population growth.  Over the September 2018 quarter, the national population is estimated to have increased by 109,057 persons to be up 395,101 persons or 1.6% over the 12 months to September 2018.  
 

While nationally the drivers of population growth are net overseas migration and natural increase (births minus deaths), between the states net interstate migration is an important component of population growth.  This week’s Pulse looks at the arrivals and departures data for each state and territory.

 

 

NSW Net interstate migration to NSW saw the state lose 22,113 residents over the year to September 2018, its largest net loss of residents since March 2008.  As the chart shows, the biggest sources of arrivals to NSW over the year were Qld (36,730), Vic (25,876) and ACT (11,728).  Arrivals from Vic were the highest they’ve been since June 1993 while arrivals from ACT were the greatest they’ve been since December 1997.

 

Vic  Annual net interstate migration was recorded at 13,985 persons over the year to September 2018, the lowest it has been since December 2015.  The largest source of migration to Vic was NSW (32,688) followed by Qld (22,433) and WA (12,187).  Arrivals from Qld were the highest on record while arrivals from Tas (4,195) were the highest since March 2004 and arrivals from ACT (4,076) were also the highest on record.
 

 

Qld Net interstate migration over the year to September 2018 was recorded at 24,316 persons, which although it remains high was slightly lower than the previous quarter.  With 52,409 arrivals, NSW accounted for almost 50% (49.45%) of interstate arrivals to Qld over the year.  Arrivals from NSW were the highest they’ve been since December 2005.  The 24,680 arrivals from Vic were the greatest since June 2004 and the 3,799 arrivals from ACT was the greatest since June 2005.  

 

SA The state lost a net 4,608 residents due to interstate migration over the year to September 2018, which was its smallest net loss since June 2015.  The major sources of arrivals to SA were Vic (6,830), NSW (6,170) and NT (2,290).  Arrivals from NSW were the highest they’ve been since March 2005, arrivals from Vic were the highest since December 2007, arrivals from Qld (4,785) were the highest they’ve been since June 2014 and arrivals from ACT (852) were the highest they’ve been since March 2003.

 

WA The state has seen a large net loss of residents due to residents leaving for other states over the year (10,304) however; the outflow has slowed to its smallest levels since June 2016.  Although WA is shedding many residents, arrivals from NSW (7,970) were the greatest they’ve been since September 2014, arrivals from Vic (7,364) were the greatest they’ve been since September 2015 and arrivals from NT were the greatest they’ve been since December 2015.

 

Tas Over the year to September 2018, net interstate migration of 2,370 persons was recorded which was slightly lower than the previous quarter however, net interstate migration remains at the highest levels since June 2004.  NSW (3,560), Vic (4,053) and Qld (3,800) were the prime sources of arrivals to Tas.  Arrivals from NSW were the highest they’ve been since December 2004, arrivals from Vic were the largest since September 2004 and arrivals from Qld were the largest since March 2008.

 

ACT  Net interstate migration was recorded at 274 persons over the past year, the smallest gain from net interstate migration since March 2016.  With 12,604 arrivals to the ACT, NSW accounted for 56.7% of all arrivals over the past year.  The only two other significant states for arrivals were Vic (3,358) and Qld (3,290). While arrivals to ACT were generally trending lower, arrivals from NSW were the greatest on record over the past year.


Over the year to September 2018, there were 394,193 interstate arrivals across the nation.  As the chart shows, Australian’s are becoming more willing to move interstate with the 394,193 arrivals over the past year the greatest number since September 2003. 
 
While the economies of NSW and Vic remain much stronger than elsewhere, the cost of housing in these states is also much higher than elsewhere.  With many places willing to allow greater flexibility around working remotely it is no surprise that the trend towards more interstate movements increasing.  We would expect that this trend is set to continue over the coming years.

"There were 1,669 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, down from 1,875 over the previous week. This time last year, volumes were significantly higher with 3,990 homes taken to auction over what was the pre-Easter weekend, traditionally one of the busiest weeks for auctions each year. 

Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 56.0 per cent across the combined capital cities this week, increasing from last week’s final clearance rate of 51.4 per cent although this will revise lower as the remaining results are collected. The finalised clearance rates have sat above 49.0 per cent for 5 of the last 6 weeks and it’s likely that this week will be no different. Over the same week last year the final clearance rate was recorded at 62.7 per cent. 
 

 

In Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 57.0 per cent was recorded across 820 auctions this week, while last week there were 920 auctions returning a final clearance rate of 52.1 per cent. This time last year, 2,071 auctions were held across the city, returning a clearance rate of 65.8 per cent. 
 

Weekly Clearance Rate, Combined Capital Cities

 

There were 506 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary clearance rate of 62.2 per cent although again this will revise down over the week as more results are collected. In comparison, there were 638 auctions held over the previous week and the final auction clearance rate was 54.2 per cent. One year ago, 1,383 auctions were held and the clearance rate came in at 61.1 per cent. 

Looking at the smaller auction markets, Canberra and Tasmania saw fewer homes taken to auction week-on-week. Preliminary results show that auction clearance rates were down slightly over the week in Adelaide and Brisbane.

"Suburbs with the largest average land sizes are generally bucking the broader capital city housing market trends with stronger value changes or milder declines over the past year than the broader capital city markets.
 

Capital city suburbs with the largest average land size for sales over the year to Feb-19

 

The adjoining table highlights the five suburbs in each capital city with the largest average land area based on sales over the 12 months to February 2019.  It also shows the median value of these suburbs and the change in median values over the year.

One thing that is immediately noticeable from this data is the fact that the annual change across these suburbs for houses is typically superior to that across the broader capital cities.

In Sydney, house values have fallen by -11.5% over the 12 months to February 2019.  Looking at the five suburbs listed, only Kenthurst has recorded a weaker annual change.

Melbourne house values are also -11.5% lower over the past year and all of the suburbs listed have seen more moderate value falls than that across Greater Melbourne.

Brisbane house values were -0.4% lower over the past year and two of the five suburbs have seen a stronger annual change.

The 0.9% annual increase in Adelaide house values means that four of the five suburbs listed have seen stronger value growth over the past year.

Perth house values are -6.7% lower over the past year with four of the five suburbs listed recording either value increases or more moderate declines than -6.7%.

Greater Hobart house values were 6.8% higher over the past year and three of the five suburbs listed have recorded growth in excess of that.

House values in Darwin increased by 0.2% over the past year and three of the five suburbs with the largest average land sizes recorded greater value increases than that.

While Canberra house values increased by 4.1% over the past year, only two of the suburbs listed recorded growth in excess of this.

Although this data broadly shows that suburbs with larger average land sizes are holding up better in the housing downturn, it also highlights that many buyers value larger land sizes.  As new development increasingly moves toward higher densities and smaller lot sizes for houses, large housing lots are likely to continue to be highly desirable.  The desirability won’t just come from more space but also in some instances they will be desirable because of the potential for sub-division in the future.

Over the same week last year, the auction clearance rate was higher with 68.7 per cent of the 1,653 auctions returning a successful result. 
 

 

There were 634 auctions held in Sydney this week with preliminary results showing a 63.1 per cent clearance rate, up from 52.3 per cent across a higher volume of auctions last week (701), although as usual this will revise lower as final results are collected. Over the same week last year 1,093 homes were taken to auction across the city returning a clearance rate of 64.8 per cent. 
 

 

Across the smaller auction markets, Brisbane and Perth were the only places to see auction volumes fall week-on-week. 

Looking at results by property type, houses outperformed units this week with 56.5 per cent of houses selling at auction, while 55.0 per cent of units sold across the combined capital cities.

"There were 1,196 auctions held across the combined capital cities this week, significantly lower than the 2,201 held last week, and the 1,764 one year ago. The fall in auction volumes this week is due to the fact that four of the eight states and territories have a public holiday this coming Monday. 

The preliminary auction clearance rate across the combined capital cities rose to 52.2 per cent this week, up from the final 50.4 per cent last week. Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was recorded at 63.3 per cent.
 

 

The two largest auction markets, Melbourne and Sydney, saw their preliminary clearance rates rise, however volumes were lower week on week. Melbourne returned a 53.5 per cent preliminary auction clearance rate across 215 auctions and Sydney saw 58.2 per cent of the 702 auctions held successful.

Across the smaller auction markets, the highest clearance rate was in Adelaide where 55.3 per cent of auctions cleared over the week.

 

Weekly Clearance Rate, Combined Capital Cities
 

Looking at results by property type, units outperformed houses again this week with 55.4 per cent of units selling at auction, while 50.8 per cent of houses sold across the combined capital cities.

"There were 2,303 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities over the week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 54.1 per cent, while last week, auction volumes were lower with 1,450 auctions held and a 51.2 per cent clearance rate. Over the same week last year, 3,313 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 66.8 per cent was recorded. 

Last week’s final clearance rate marked the second week in a row where the final clearance rate held above 50 per cent, an improvement given the weekly auction clearance rate sat at or below 42 per cent for 5 consecutive weeks in November/December 2018. It will be interesting to see how clearance rates hold up now that auction volumes have started to pick up. The seasonal pattern over previous years has seen a similar bounce back in the auction clearance rate in February through to mid-to-late March before trending lower into autumn and winter. Considering advertised stock levels remain high and most other indicators are soft, it’s possible a similar weakening trend in auction markets will become evident next month.  
 

 

There were 1,144 auctions held in Melbourne this week with preliminary results showing a clearance rate of 53.1 per cent, increasing from last week when the final clearance rate was recorded at 52.5 per cent across 657 auctions. Over the same week last year, the auction clearance rate was significantly higher with 70.6 per cent of the 1,606 auctions returning a successful result. 
 

Weekly Clearance Rate, Combined Capital Cities
 

Sydney was host to 795 auctions this week with preliminary results showing a 58.6 per cent clearance rate, up from 54.6 per cent across 523 auctions last week. Over the same week last year 1,259 homes were taken to auction across the city returning a clearance rate of 65.1 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Brisbane and Canberra were the only cities to see a rise in clearance rates week-on-week, while auction volumes increased everywhere except Perth and Tasmania over the week.

"There were 1,444 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities over the week, increasing from the previous week when 928 auctions were held, although lower than this week last year when 1,992 auctions were held. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 55.2 per cent this week, although as usual this will revise over the week as remaining results are collected. Last week’s final clearance rate came in at 51.1 cent across the combined capitals, the first time we have seen the final clearance rate hold above 50 per cent since September 2018 however keep in mind that volumes are still relatively low. One year ago, a clearance rate of 66.1 per cent was recorded. 
 

 

Melbourne was host to 657 auctions this week with preliminary results showing a clearance rate of 54.2 per cent, increasing from last week when the final clearance rate was recorded at 52.4 per cent across 350 auctions. Over the same week last year, the auction clearance rate was significantly higher with 69.8 per cent of the 932 auctions returning a successful result.

There were 521 auctions held in Sydney this week with preliminary results showing a 61.0 per cent clearance rate, up from 54.0 per cent across 322 auctions last week. Over the same week last year 737 homes were taken to auction across the city returning a clearance rate of 67.8 per cent.

"There were 2,204 capital city homes taken to auction this week, returning a preliminary weighted average clearance rate of 55.0 per cent. This week’s volumes are slightly lower than last week’s 2,293 auctions held, which was the busiest week so far this year. The higher volumes last week saw the clearance rate dip below 50 per cent and it’s likely, as volumes increase, we will see clearance rates trend below this mark. Comparing results to one year ago, volumes are significantly lower than the 3,026 homes taken to auction over the same week in 2018. Given the combined capital cities posted another month on month decline in home values in February, its expected vendors will remain reluctant to auction their property while selling conditions remain challenging and year on year volumes will continue to trend lower throughout the year.  

 

In Melbourne, Australia’s largest auction market, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 54.9 per cent was recorded across 1,046 auctions this week, up from the 50.6 per cent final clearance rate last week when volumes were higher (1,128). 

There were 799 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 61.3 per cent, increasing from the 50.1 per cent final clearance rate last week when 801 Sydney homes were taken to auction.

Weekly Clearance Rate, Combined Capital Cities

Across the smaller auction markets, preliminary results show that Adelaide was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with a 47.9 per cent success rate. Brisbane was the worst performing auction market this week, with only 32.9 per cent of homes selling at auction.

"Auction activity is continuing to ramp up after the seasonal slowdown, with 929 capital city homes taken to auction this week, increasing on last week when 536 auctions were held as of final figures. The higher week on week activity returned a preliminary auction clearance rate of 54.1 per cent. While this is higher than the final auction clearance rate last week (42.8 per cent), it’s expected this will revise lower as the remaining results are collected to remain around the mid-to-low 40 per cent range.

Although clearance rates and activity remain low, the early flow of auction data for 2019 is showing a subtle bounce back in the clearance rate relative to the lows recorded through December last year which is a seasonal trend similar to what has been seen over previous years.

Comparing results to one year ago, volumes and clearance rates are significantly lower than what were seen over the corresponding week last year, when 1,470 capital city homes went to auction and 63.7 per cent sold.
 

 

Looking at results across each of the individual capital cities, volumes were higher over the week across all auction markets with the exception of Adelaide where activity was down.

Melbourne was the busiest auction market this week, in terms of volumes with 352 auctions held across the city, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 53.7 per cent.  This is quite a bit lower than what we were seeing last year, when 70.7 per cent of homes sold over the same week when volumes were higher (619).
 

Weekly Clearance Rate, Combined Capital Cities

There were 321 Sydney homes auctioned this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 59.2 per cent.  Interestingly, Sydney was the best performing capital city auction market according to final results last week, while this week’s preliminary clearance rate is also the highest amongst the cities. 

Across the smaller cities, Canberra returned a preliminary clearance rate of 56.3 per cent, while Brisbane’s preliminary result came in at 42.6 per cent.

"Rental rates across the nation were -0.1% lower in December 2018 and were recorded at a median value of $433/week.  While rents fell -0.2% to $462/week across the combined capital cities over the month, rents in the combined regional markets increased by 0.2% to sit at $373/week.

The CoreLogic Quarterly Rental Review has just been released, providing an update on rental market conditions through to December 2018.  The report found a mixed situation, with rents falling in Sydney, Darwin and Canberra, a fairly significant slowdown in rental growth for Melbourne, but growth elsewhere.  

CoreLogic research analyst Cameron Kusher said, “Sydney and Melbourne are both seeing the impact of significant demand from investors over recent years, along with a substantial ramp-up in new housing supply (largely apartment), much of which was purchased by investors.  Darwin rents have been falling for many years and they continue to decline.”

Rental markets are on the up in Brisbane and Perth, after a number of years in decline. Rents are also continuing to rise elsewhere; however the rate of growth has slowed compared to a year ago.

Sydney remains the most expensive capital city in which to rent, with a median rent of $583/week (which is $43/week more expensive than the second most expensive in the country of Canberra at $539/week). Hobart has historically been the most affordable capital city rental market, however strong rises in rents over recent years have pushed rental costs well above those in Adelaide and Perth and are actually now marginally higher than rents in Brisbane.


 

Key highlights : 

Australia’s weekly rents fell by -0.1% in December 2018 to be -0.3% lower over the fourth quarter of 2018, however rents increased by 0.5% over the 12 months to December 2018.
Capital city rents were -0.4% lower over the quarter and unchanged year-on-year while regional market rents were 0.3% higher over the quarter to be 1.8% higher over the past 12 months.
The annual change in both combined capital city and national rents is the lowest on record based on data which is available back to 2005.
Over the past 12 months, rents have increased in all capital cities except for Sydney and Darwin.
Brisbane and Perth are the only two capital cities in which the annual change throughout 2018 has accelerated relative to the change in 2017.
Gross rental yields are rising, currently recorded at 3.95% nationally at the end of December 2018 compared to 3.85% at the end of the previous quarter and 3.73% a year ago.
Gross rental yields have increased over the past 12 months in all capital cities except for Hobart and Darwin.

"The first week of auction reporting for 2019 saw 526 capital city homes taken to auction, this is down almost 34 per cent on the same week last year when 790 auctions were held.  The preliminary auction clearance rate came in at 47.8 per cent, which is higher than what we were seeing at the end of 2018, when most of December saw clearance rates trend around the low 40 per cent range.  Comparing results from over the same week last year, the combined capital city preliminary clearance rate came in at 67.7 per cent, before revising down to a 62 per cent final clearance rate.  It’s likely this week’s clearance rates will see the usual downward revision as final results are collected and come in the low-mid 40 per cent range.

It is important to note, volumes are significantly lower than what we were seeing at the end of last year and clearance rates are generally less indicative over periods of such low activity. As the number of auctions held increases over the next few weeks we will be able to get a firmer perspective on auction conditions for 2019.
 

Looking at results across the individual capital cities, Sydney returned the strongest clearance rate of 53.7 per cent across 129 auctions. However it was Melbourne which saw the highest number of homes auctioned, with 156 held, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 44.1 per cent.

Adelaide was the second best performing auction market this week, according to preliminary results. There were 102 Adelaide homes taken to auction with 52.8 per cent selling.  

Perth returned a preliminary clearance rate of only 25 per cent this week, making it the worst performing auction market. There were only 30 homes taken to auction across the city however.

"The combined capital cities are expected to see a lower volume of auctions this week with CoreLogic currently tracking 2,285 auctions, down from the 2,631 held last week and lower than the 2,890 homes taken to auction one year ago. 

 

Melbourne is set to see a lower volumes of auctions take place over the week, with 1,101 being tracked so far, decreasing from last week when 1,283 auctions were held across the city and much lower than 12 months ago when 1,630 homes went under the hammer.

In Sydney, 695 homes are currently scheduled for auction this week, down from 870 last week and lower than the same week last year when 708 auctions were held across the city.

Across the smaller auction markets, the number of homes scheduled for auction this week are lower in Brisbane and Canberra, while Adelaide, Perth and Tasmania are expected to see a higher number of auctions take place.

This week, the busiest suburb for auctions is in Victoria where Bentleigh East has 20 homes scheduled for auction. Followed by Craigieburn also in Victoria with 17 scheduled auctions, while St Ives (NSW) and Bentleigh (Vic) each have 15 auctions scheduled.

 

There were 2,631 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities last week, returning a final auction clearance rate of 41 per cent.  The weighted average has continued to decline over each of the past four weeks, surpassing the previous week as the lowest recorded since October 2011.  Last year, a significantly higher 3,371 capital city homes went to auction returning a clearance rate of 59.5 per cent. 

 

 

Melbourne’s final auction clearance rate came in at 43.8 per cent last week. There were 1,283 auctions held across the city, down from the week prior when 1,378 Melbourne homes were taken to auction and a lower 42.7 per cent cleared.

"This week 2,742 homes were taken to auction across the combined capital cities, only slightly higher than the 2,701 auctions held last week. Auction volumes have started to trend higher over the last few weeks, as we traditionally see this time of year. However current volumes remain lower than over the same period last year. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 47 per cent this week, rising from last week’s final clearance rate of 41.9 per cent; the lowest result seen since June 2012. Over the same week last year the final clearance rate was recorded at 60.3 per cent across 3,291 auctions.

 

Looking at results by property type, units outperformed houses once again this week with 49.4 per cent of units selling at auction, while 46.1 per cent of houses sold across the combined capital cities.

 

 

In Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 45.8 per cent was recorded across 1,381 auctions this week. Last week there were 1,132 auctions returning a final clearance rate of 41.4 per cent. Over the same week last year, 1,647 Melbourne homes were taken to auction with 65.4 per cent returning a successful result. 

There were 927 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary clearance rate of 50.6 per cent. In comparison, there were 1,035 auctions held over the previous week and the final auction clearance rate was 44.8 per cent. One year ago, 1,143 auctions were held across the city and the clearance rate came in at 56.2 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Canberra returned the strongest preliminary clearance rate of 50 per cent, while only 33.3 of Perth homes sold at auction.

"There were 2,689 homes taken to auction over the week, down from the previous week when 2,745 auctions were held, and much lower than this week last year when 3,438 auctions were held across the combined capital cities. 

 

Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 46.9 per cent this week, increasing from last week’s final clearance rate of 42.0 per cent, the lowest clearance rate recorded since June 2012. One year ago, a clearance rate of 61.1 per cent was recorded. As final results are collected we will likely see the clearance rate revise down below 45 per cent for the fourth consecutive week.

Melbourne was host to 1,137 auctions this week with preliminary results showing a clearance rate of 44.0 per cent, increasing from last week when the final clearance rate dropped to 41.3 per cent across 1,401 auctions. Over the same week last year, the auction clearance rate was significantly higher with 65.5 per cent of the 1,736 auctions returning a successful result. 

There were 1,021 auctions held in Sydney this week making it the 5th busiest week of the year for the city with preliminary results showing a 52.4 per cent clearance rate, up from 42.8 per cent across 875 auctions last week. It’s possible that when the final results are released the clearance rate may just hold above 45 per cent, after falling below that for four of the past five weeks. Over the same week last year 1,215 homes were taken to auction across the city returning a clearance rate of 56.8 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Perth and Tasmania were the only places to see auction volumes fall week-on-week.

"The combined capital cities are expected to see a lower volume of auctions this week with CoreLogic currently tracking 2,498 auctions, down from 2,749 last week and significantly lower than the 3,371 over the same week last year. 

Melbourne is set to see volumes fall over the week, with 1,205 auctions being tracked so far, down from last week when 1,378 auctions were held across the city and much lower than 12 months ago when 1,833 homes went under the hammer.

In Sydney, 840 homes are currently scheduled for auction this week, down from 937 last week and lower than the same week last year when 1,007 auctions were held. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Brisbane is expected to be the only city to see a rise in volumes week-on-week, with fewer auctions scheduled in Adelaide, Canberra, Perth and Tasmania.
 

 

The busiest suburb for auctions this week is Victoria’s Reservoir, with 26 homes set to go under the hammer. Following with 19 scheduled auctions each is Port Macquarie and Randwick both in NSW and Glen Waverley (Vic).

 

Last week, 2,749 homes were taken to auction across the combined capital cities, slightly higher than the week prior when 2,701 auctions took place. The higher volumes saw the final clearance rate weaken further with only 41.3 per cent of homes selling at auction; making it the lowest result seen since Oct 2011.  In comparison, this time last year, 3,291 homes went to auction and a clearance rate of 60.3 per cent was recorded. 

Melbourne’s final clearance rate was recorded at 42.7 per cent across 1,378 auctions last week, improving on the 41.4 per cent final clearance rate the previous week across a lower 1,132 auctions. Over the corresponding week last year 1,647 Melbourne homes were auctioned and a stronger clearance rate was recorded (65.4 per cent).

Sydney’s final auction clearance rate came in at 41.6 per cent across 937 auctions last week, falling from the 44.8 per cent across a higher 1,035 auctions over the previous week. Over the same week last year, 1,143 homes went to auction returning a clearance rate of 56.2 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates improved in Perth and Tasmania, while Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra saw clearance rates fall week-on-week. 

Of the non-capital city auction markets, Geelong was the best performing in terms of clearance rate (46.4 per cent).

Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 45.5 per cent this week, compared to 43.3 per cent last week, while one year ago, a final clearance rate of 60.9 per cent was recorded. As final results are collected we will likely see the clearance rate revise down below 45 per cent for the third consecutive week.

 

Melbourne was host to 1,411 auctions this week with preliminary results showing a clearance rate of 43.5 per cent, down from last week when 46.2 per cent of auctions were successful. Over the same week last year, the auction clearance rate was significantly higher with 66.9 per cent of the 1,732 auctions returning a successful result. 

There were 874 auctions held in Sydney this week, up from 844 last week, although lower than this week last year when 1,061 homes were taken to auction across the city. Preliminary results show that 48.5 per cent of auctions were successful this week, up from just 42.1 per cent last week. Similar to the combined capital cities, the final auction clearance rate for Sydney has been below 45 per cent for three of the past four weeks, and it’s likely that we will see that again this week as final results are collected. In comparison, one year ago, the clearance rate across the city was recorded at 54.8 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, preliminary results show an improvement in clearance rates across Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth. Tasmania has reported 4 auction results so far and are yet to have a successful result.

"The number of homes scheduled to go to auction this week is set to rise across the combined capital cities with CoreLogic currently tracking 2,602 auctions, up from 2,386 over the previous week.

 

Melbourne accounts for 51 per cent of all auctions this week with just over 1,300 homes scheduled to go under the hammer, increasing from 1,127 last week. Sydney volumes are sitting at similar levels week-on-week with 845 auctions currently on the radar, compared to 844 last week.

Across the smaller auction markets, Adelaide will see fewer homes taken to auction week-on-week, while Brisbane, Perth and Tasmania will see auction activity increase. Canberra will see little change in auction volumes when compared to last week.

Year-on-year auction volumes are lower across each individual capital city. A total of 3,390 homes were taken to auction this time last year.

All five of the busiest suburbs for auctions this week are in Melbourne with Reservoir coming in first place hosting 28 auctions, followed by Mount Waverley (21) and Glen Waverley (19), while Bentleigh East and Richmond are set to hold 17 auctions each this week.

 

Summary of Last Week’s Results:

Last week saw 2,386 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, returning a final auction clearance rate of 43.3 per cent, increasing from the previous week when 42.7 per cent of the 1,541 homes taken to auction were successful.

 

Melbourne was the busiest city in terms of auction activity with 1,127 homes taken to auction, returning a final clearance rate of 46.2 per cent.

"The first week of November saw fewer homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, after last week recorded the fifth busiest week for auctions this year (2,928). There were a total of 1,529 auctions held this week returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 47.4 per cent, increasing only slightly on last week’s final clearance rate of 47 per cent. As the remaining results are collected, the final clearance rate will see its usual downward revision and likely come in lower than last week.  Over the corresponding week last year, a much higher 61.5 per cent of auctions were successful (2,046).

 

 

Melbourne saw the most notable dip in volumes this week; the lower volumes is what we traditionally see the week just prior to the Melbourne cup festivities, while also coming off the back of the second busiest week for auctions this year last week (1,709). There were only 264 Melbourne homes taken to auction this week, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 50.5 per cent. Last week, a final clearance rate of 48.6 per cent was recorded across the higher volumes.

 

A preliminary auction clearance rate of 47.7 per cent was recorded across Sydney this week, improving on last week’s final clearance rate of 45.3 per cent. There were 801 auctions held across the city this week, which was only 3 extra auctions compared to last week.  

Across the smaller auction markets, Adelaide was the best performing in terms of clearance rates with 57.6 per cent of auctions successful, while only 33.3 per cent of homes sold across Brisbane this week.


 

 

 ",2021_04_23,5-Nov-18,N/A,Clearance rates continue to track at sub-50 per cent levels while auction activity slumps as Melbourne goes to the races
"This week, there are fewer auctions scheduled to take place across the combined capital cities, with 1,438 currently being tracked by CoreLogic, which is half the volume of auctions recorded last week when the combined capital cities saw 2,928 homes taken to auction.

 

Across Melbourne, the number of auctions to be held is expected to fall this week, with only 234 Melbourne homes scheduled to go to auction. The lower volumes is likely due to the upcoming Melbourne cup festivities and coming off the back of the second busiest week for auctions this year (1,709).

Activity across Sydney is set to remain relatively steady week-on-week, with 764 homes scheduled for auction this week, decreasing by 4.3 per cent on last week’s final figures which saw 798 auctions held across the city.

Across the smaller auction markets, activity across Adelaide and Brisbane is virtually unchanged week-on-week, while Canberra, Perth and Tasmania are all expected to see a higher volume of auctions this week.

Given the low activity in Victoria this week, it’s no surprise that all of the busiest suburbs for auctions are in New South Wales. Topping the list with 12 homes scheduled to go under the hammer is Rose Bay, followed by Paddington, St Ives and Woollahra with 10 scheduled auctions each.

 

 Summary of Last Week’s Results:

There were 2,928 capital city homes taken to auction last week, making it the fifth busiest week for auctions so far this year. While activity increased over the week, more than half of the homes taken to auction failed to sell. A final auction clearance rate of 47 per cent was recorded last week; the fifth consecutive week where the combined capital cities have seen less than 50 per cent of homes sell.  Last year, there were 3,713 homes taken to auction over the same week, when a much higher 64.5 per cent sold. 

 

 

Melbourne’s final auction clearance rate came in higher week-on-week. The improved clearance rate last week was across the second highest volume of auctions seen across the city this year. There were 1,709 auctions held, returning a clearance rate of 48.6 per cent, having increased on the 45.7 per cent over the week prior when 1,087 auctions were held.

In Sydney, 798 auctions took place last week with 45.3 per cent successful, up from the 44.6 per cent over the week prior when fewer auctions were held (675). Although the clearance rate was higher over the week, it remained much lower than the 58.3 per cent of homes successful at auction over the same week last year when a significantly higher 1,215 auctions took place.

 

Weekly Clearance Rates Combined Capitals

Across the smaller auction markets, Adelaide was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with 57.6 per cent of homes selling at auction last week, although this was lower than the previous week.

Auction volumes were the highest they have been since late March with 2,919 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, increasing from 2,139 last week although much lower than this time last year (3,713). The higher volumes this week were largely thanks to Melbourne as vendors rush to auction prior to the Melbourne Cup Carnival slowdown where volumes will temporarily plummet across the city. 

 

 

Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 50.2 per cent across the combined capital cities although it’s likely to drop below 50 per cent for the 5th consecutive week when final results are released on Thursday. Last week saw the final clearance rate revise down to 46.0 per cent, while this week last year saw 64.5 per cent of auctions return a successful result.

 

 

Melbourne was host to 1,706 auctions this week making it the 2nd busiest week for the city all year. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 49.8 per cent, up from last week when just 45.7 per cent of auctions were successful, which was the lowest clearance rate the city had seen since June 2012 (38.6 per cent across 127 auction results). Over the same week last year, the auction clearance rate was significantly higher with 70.2 per cent of the 1,983 auctions returning a successful result. 

There were 796 auctions held in Sydney this week, up from 675 last week, although substantially lower than this week last year when 1,215 homes were taken to auction across the city. Preliminary results show that 50.7 per cent of auctions were successful this week, up from 44.6 per cent last week. The final auction clearance rate has been sitting below 50 per cent for 4 consecutive weeks now, and it is likely to be the case again this week as final results are collected. In comparison, one year ago, the clearance rate across the city was recorded at 58.3 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, preliminary results show an improvement in clearance rates across all cities except Brisbane while Perth was the only city to see auction volumes fall over the week.

 

Preliminary results by property type
 

 

Preliminary results by sub-region

 ",2021_04_23,29-Oct-18,N/A,Preliminary results show half of the homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities were successful over the 5th busiest auction week of the year
"The auction market over the 2018 year to date has consistently weakened, with clearance rates reducing from the low 60% range to trend below 50% in October. The highest clearance rate for the year was back in late February (66.8%), and as clearance rates progressively decline; the spring selling season was highly anticipated as a test of market conditions.

Traditionally coming out of winter, the months following are usually seen as an optimal time to sell, with an increase in both the number of newly advertised homes for sale and weekly auction volumes. However, while we’ve seen the usual seasonal uplift in the number of homes being auctioned, auction volumes are tracking at their lowest level over the spring to date period this year relative to the same 8 week period over the past 5 years, while the combined capital clearance rate has seen further softening with less than half of homes selling at auction over the past 4 weeks. The last time auction conditions were quite this sombre was in 2012, over what was the last significant market downturn, highlighting the correlation between property values and clearance rates as a timely indicator on market conditions and sentiment. 

To further understand this timely indicator, we take a look at each of the capital city auction markets over the spring season to date and the equivalent period last year.  With weekly results showing a divergence across the property types we analyse the performance year-on-year across houses and units.

 

Combined Capital Cities

Across the combined capital cities, 53.9% of units have sold at auction over the past 8 weeks, while half of the houses taken to auction over the same period have failed to sell (49.4%). In 2017 a similar trend was evident, in that, units were more successful at auction, however this variance is more apparent as of late with 4.5% more units selling at auction than houses over the spring season to date compared to the 2.3% difference over the same period in 2017. However, it’s important to note that units account for a smaller proportion of overall activity. 

 

 

Both volumes and clearance rates were significantly higher across both house and unit markets over the 8 week period in 2017, with 12,825 houses and 5,130 units taken to market across the capital cities, with 65.4% and 67.7% selling respectively. 

The lower year on year results is hardly a surprise given home values have been in decline for 12 consecutive months now, and if our weekly clearance rates over the past 4 weeks are any indication it’s likely this will weaken further. Final results last week saw only 44 per cent of houses successful at auction, while a higher 51% of units sold across the combined capital cities.
 

Melbourne

Across Australia’s largest auction market of Melbourne the performance across the individual property types year on year is quite interesting, with clearances rates tracking higher for houses compared to units for most of 2017, while this year has seen results in contrast of this with units the better performer.  There were 4,588 houses taken to auction over the past 8 weeks with just over half selling (50.5%), while units show a higher 58.7% success rate across 2,230 auctions so far this spring. Over the corresponding period last year, a significantly higher 72.4% of Melbourne houses sold at auction and units saw a clearance rate of 69.3%, which happened to be over the period just prior to the peak in Melbourne dwelling values. 

 

Sydney

In Sydney, the gap between the performance of clearance rates across the property types has reduced over recent months. So far this spring 3,581 Sydney houses have been auctioned with 47.2% selling, which was lower than the 50.1% of units that sold over the same period, however not quite as disparate to one year ago.  Last year, over the same 8 week period 61.8% of houses sold and a higher 68.7% of units sold. Volumes were considerably lower year-on-year across both the house and unit market of Sydney. 


Across the smaller auction markets, auction volumes and clearance rates are lower across all markets with the exception of Canberra, where volumes are higher across both the house and unit markets and the clearance rate for units is higher over spring so far relative to the same period last year.

 


 

Across the smaller auction markets, auction volumes and clearance rates are lower across all markets with the exception of Canberra, where volumes are higher across both the house and unit markets and the clearance rate for units is higher over spring so far relative to the same period last year.

In Adelaide, while year on year volumes are lower, clearances rates are only slightly lower across both houses and units over spring so far compared to last year.  658 houses have been taken to market across Adelaide so far this spring with 61.3% selling,  which is only slightly lower than the 62.5% last year when a higher 710 auctions were held over the same period. Units have seen 11 fewer auctions held year on year, with 46.3% selling, compared to the 49.1% sold last year.

Brisbane has seen 894 houses and 99 units taken to auction so far this spring, returning a clearance rate over the period of 40.8% and 34.1% respectively, which is lower than over the same period last year when 1,055 houses across Brisbane went under the hammer and 46.2% cleared, and 43.3% of the 121 units that went to auction sold.

Canberra was the only auction market that saw a higher volume of auctions this year compared to the same 8 week period last year across both houses and units, with 512 houses taken to auction over spring so far and 95 units, where 61.1% and 53% sold respectively, with Canberra units being the only market where the clearance rate improved year on year. However, volumes across Canberra are very low particularly across the unit market.
There were 198 Perth houses and 28 units taken to auction over the last 8 weeks, with a clearance rate of 30.8% and 13%, with both clearance rates and the number of auctions were lower compared to last year.

Activity across Tasmania is generally quite subdued, with the majority of auctions being for houses where volumes are down more than 40% year on year, with only 25 auctions held over spring so far and only half of which sold, compared to the 64.7% that sold last year when volumes were higher.

 ",2021_04_23,25-Oct-18,N/A,Auction Action Losing Traction
"The combined capital cities are expected to see an uplift in auction activity this week, with 2,782 homes scheduled to go under the hammer; this is an increase of 30 per cent when compared to last week’s final results which saw 2,139 properties taken to auction.

 

Melbourne is set to see the most notable increase in activity this week, with volumes expected to rise by 50 per cent on last week’s figures with 1,630 Melbourne homes scheduled to go to auction, increasing from the 1,087 held last week.

In Sydney volumes are set to increase to a lesser extent with 756 properties scheduled to go to auction this week, rising by 12 per cent from last week’s 675 auctions.

Across the remaining auction markets, volumes are higher across Brisbane and Canberra, while activity across Adelaide and Tasmania will remain steady, and Perth will host 20 per cent fewer auctions.
 

Summary of Last Week’s Results:

The combined capital cities returned a final auction clearance rate of 46 per cent last week, marking the 4th consecutive week below 50 per cent. There were 2,139 homes taken to auction, having increased on the 1,851 auctions held over the week prior when a higher 47 per cent cleared. Last year, 2,519 homes were taken to auction across the combined capitals returning a final auction clearance rate of 64.7 per cent

 

 

Across Melbourne, auction volumes rose with 1,087 auctions held, however final figures saw the clearance rate drop to 45.7 per cent; not only lower week-on-week but the lowest since June 2012 (38.6 per cent). Over the week prior, fewer Melbourne homes were taken to market with 912 auctions held returning a final clearance rate of 50.4 per cent. One year ago, 1,251 auctions took place, returning a clearance rate of 70.3 per cent.

In Sydney, the final auction clearance rate fell slightly to 44.6 per cent last week, from 45.1 per cent the previous week. There were 675 auctions held last week, increasing from the 647 the previous week, however lower than the 823 last year when a higher 61.3 per cent sold.
 

Weekly Clearance Rates Combined Capitals

 

 

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates improved in Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth, while Canberra’s came in lower week-on-week. Tasmania had only 1 auction take place last week, which was unsuccessful.   

Geelong was the best performing non-capital city region last week, with 48.2 per cent of the 34 auctions successful. However, the Hunter region was host to the highest number of auctions (59).

"There were 1,850 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 50.7 per cent. Last week, the final auction clearance rate came in at 49.5 per cent across a slightly lower 1,817 auctions. While preliminary results show an improvement on last week’s final clearance rates, it’s likely that the final weighted average result will see its usual downward revision as more results are collected and come in below 50 per cent for the 3rd consecutive week.  If we compare figures from this time last year, both clearance rates and volumes were significantly higher (2,525 auctions, 67.1 per cent cleared).

 

Interestingly, looking at results by property type, units were much more successful at auction this week with 58 per cent selling, while only 48 per cent of houses sold. Quite a difference to the same week last year, when both property types saw virtually the same success rate (67 per cent).

 

 

There were 914 auctions held in Melbourne this week with a preliminary clearance rate of 52.1 per cent, after last week saw a slightly lower 904 homes go under the hammer, returning a final clearance rate of 51.8 per cent. Over the same week last year, 1,223 auctions were held across the city and a clearance rate of 73.2 per cent was recorded.

Sydney was host to 645 auctions this week with preliminary results showing a clearance rate of 52 per cent, increasing on last week when 46.1 per cent of the 611 auctions held sold under the hammer. However, lower than the 63.3 per cent success rate seen over the same week last year when more Sydney homes went to auction (928).

Across the smaller auction markets, the highest preliminary clearance rate was recorded in Canberra where 63.6 per cent of the 55 reported auctions were successful, followed by Adelaide were 53.3 per cent of homes sold.  
 

 

 ",2021_04_23,15-Oct-18,N/A,Preliminary auction results show 50.7 per cent of homes sold at auction
"There was an increase in auction volumes over the week with 2,119 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, up from 1,851 over the previous week although lower than this time last year (2,519). Traditionally, auction activity ramps up around late October through to December each year and it is not uncommon to have weeks where volumes are in excess of 3,000 during that time so it will be interesting to see what volumes are like this year given the softening market. 

Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 49.8 per cent across the combined capital cities, up from 47.0 per cent last week, however much lower than 12 months ago (64.7 per cent), marking the 4th consecutive week where the clearance rate has been below 50 per cent.

 

 

Melbourne was host to 1,088 auctions this week returning a preliminary clearance rate of just 47.5 per cent, after last week saw a 50.4 per cent success rate across 912 auctions, the lowest final clearance rate the city had seen since July 2012. Over the same week last year, 1,251 auctions were held and a final clearance rate of 70.3 per cent was recorded.

There were 659 auctions held in Sydney this week, up from 647 over the previous week. The preliminary clearance rate of 52.2 per cent is up from 45.1 per cent last week although we will see some downwards revision over the next few days as the remaining results are collected. One year ago, 823 auctions were held and the clearance rate came in at 61.3 per cent. 

Looking at results by property type, units outperformed houses once again this week with 55.4 per cent of units selling at auction, while 47.6 per cent of houses sold across the combined capital cities.
 

 

 ",2021_04_23,21-Oct-18,N/A,"Auction activity picks up over the week with 2,119 homes taken to auction"
"Auction activity across the combined capital cities increased this week after last week’s grand final and public holiday slowdown, with 1,809 homes taken to auction, almost doubling from the 895 last week. The higher volumes returned a preliminary auction clearance rate of 53.7 per cent, increasing on last week when the subdued activity returned a final auction clearance rate of 45.8 per cent; the lowest clearance rate seen since June 2012 (42.0 per cent). Compared to one year ago, clearance rates and volumes continue to track lower with final results from the same week last year recording a 64.4 per cent clearance rate across 2,318 auctions.

 

Activity across Melbourne increased this week after last week saw volumes across the city plummet amidst the long weekend festivities, with 904 homes taken to auction this week, increasing significantly on last week when only 70 Melbourne homes were taken to auction. The higher volumes this week saw the preliminary clearance rate drop to 54.4 per cent, from the 57.7 per cent final clearance rate last week across the lower volumes.

 

Sydney returned a preliminary auction clearance of 53.5 per cent this week, improving on last week’s final auction clearance rate of 43.8 per cent, which was the lowest result the city has seen since December 08. There were 606 Sydney homes taken to auction this week, virtually unchanged from the week prior (608).  

Across the smaller auction markets, preliminary results show that Adelaide was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with a 66.1 per cent success rate across 62 auction results, followed closely by Canberra, where 63.9 per cent of the 61 reported auctions were successful.

"The number of homes scheduled to go to auction this week is set to rise across the combined capital cities after last week’s public holiday and grand final slowdown with CoreLogic currently tracking 1,725 auctions, almost double the volumes seen last week (895). 

 

Melbourne is expecting to see volumes pick up again this week, with 860 properties scheduled to go under the hammer, after volumes dipped significantly last week amid the grand final hype (70). In Sydney, volumes are expected to sit at similar levels to last week with 584 homes currently scheduled for auction, compared to 608 last week. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth will see an increase in activity this week, while Canberra and Perth will see fewer auctions take place.

Year-on-year auction volumes are lower across each individual capital city. A total of 2,318 homes were taken to auction this time last year.

Three of the four busiest suburbs for auctions this week are in Melbourne with Reservoir coming in first place hosting 21 auctions. A surprise addition to the top suburbs is Port Macquarie in regional New South Wales with 19 homes going under the hammer, thanks in part to an Elders auction event on Sunday. Back to Melbourne, Preston is set to host 17 auctions this week followed by Richmond with 14 auctions.

Summary of Last Week’s Results:

Last week saw 895 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, returning a final auction clearance rate of just 45.8 per cent, the lowest clearance rate we have seen since the week ending 10 June 2012 (42.0 per cent). Over the previous week 2,404 homes were taken to auction returning a clearance rate of 52.4 per cent while this time last year, 969 homes were taken to auction and the clearance rate was 66.3 per cent.  
 

 

Melbourne auction activity was subdued last week with just 70 homes taken to auction, returning a final clearance rate of 57.7 per cent across 52 results. Over the previous week, 1,161 auctions were held and the clearance rate was recorded at 53.8 per cent. Over the same week last year 122 homes were taken to auction across the city and a stronger clearance rate was recorded (87.0 per cent).

There were 608 homes taken to auction in Sydney last week returning a clearance rate of just 43.8 per cent, the lowest clearance rate the city has recorded since December 2008 and the 6th time this year the clearance rate has fallen below 50 per cent. Over the previous week, 851 homes were taken to auction and a clearance rate of 51.1 per cent was recorded, while this time last year 607 auctions were held returning a clearance rate of 64.9 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates improved across Adelaide, while Perth and Tasmania saw no change in clearance rates week-on-week. 
 

Of the non-capital city auction markets, the Hunter Region was the best performing in terms of clearance rate, with 6 of the 11 reported auctions selling (54.6 per cent), followed by the Gold Coast with a 32.3 per cent clearance rate across 31 results.

"There was a significant drop in auction numbers across the combined capital cities this week, with a total of 889 auctions held. The lower activity is the result of a number of states being host to a long weekend as well as both the AFL and NRL grand finals taking place. 

 

Preliminary results show a clearance rate of just 49.1 per cent, down from 52.4 per cent last week when final results saw volumes reach their highest level since the last week of April (2,404). Given such a low preliminary clearance rate, it will be interesting to see if we have any uplift over the next few days as final results are collected. Over the same week last year, 969 homes were taken to auction returning a clearance rate of 66.3 per cent.

Melbourne saw the most significant drop in volumes this week with only 69 homes taken to auction returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 55.6 per cent, while last week there were 1,161 auctions held and the final clearance rate came in at 53.8 per cent. This time last year, 122 auctions were held across the city, returning a clearance rate of 87.0 per cent. 

There were 601 auctions held in Sydney this week, down from 851 over the previous week. The preliminary clearance rate of 49.2 per cent is down from 51.1 per cent last week. One year ago, 607 auctions were held and the clearance rate came in at 64.9 per cent.

"Listings data – Properties Currently for Sale

Our weekly listings data tracks the number of properties that have been advertised for sale across the capital city markets over the last 28 days. A new listing is one which has not been advertised for sale over the past 6 months, while total listings are based on any property that has been advertised for sale over the last 28 days; including new and previously advertised sales. The collection and reporting of the volume of properties advertised for sale is a timely indicator to understand supply within a given market. 
 

Capital City Properties Listed for Sale 

 

Median Time on Market 

‘Time on market’ (TOM) is simply the median or middle number of days it has taken to sell a property within the given market, using the first listed for sale date and the contract date of all properties that have sold by private treaty over the most recent four week period. A high time on market figure may indicate a weaker market where there is less demand and high supply, while a low figure can indicate a higher performing market, with greater demand and lower availability of stock on the market. 

 
Capital City Median Time on Market
 
Average Vendor Discounting 

The rate of vendor discounting is the average percentage difference between the original listing price and the final selling price. The statistics are calculated across results received over the past week and include properties transacted over the past four weeks. Observations of this data suggest vendors are likely to offer greater discounts in a softer or slowing market in attempts to secure a sale, while a market that is performing well will see much lower discounts offered as buyers are more active and competitive.

The data is based on private treaty sales only and records without a valid sale price have been excluded from the vendor discount analysis. The analysis also excludes results where there are less than 10 observations.

 

Capital City Vendor Discounting
 
Median Price & Number Sold

Median price data is essentially the middle price of all those properties sold by private treaty over the most recent four week period. Private treaty sales represent around 85% of all dwelling sales across the country. Records without a valid sale price have been excluded from the analysis.

"There were 2,404 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, increasing from 1,983 over the previous week. Despite the fact auction volumes have been increasing over the month, 378 fewer auctions were held this week compared to the same week last year, predominantly due to the decline in auction volumes across Sydney and Melbourne, our two largest auction markets. 

Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 55.5 per cent across the combined capital cities this week, increasing from last week’s final clearance rate of 51.8 per cent although this will revise lower as the remaining results are collected. The finalised clearance rates have held in the low-mid 50 per cent range for the last 8 weeks and it’s likely that this week will return a similar result. Over the same week last year the final clearance rate was recorded at 66.2 per cent. 
 

 

 

In Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 55.5 per cent was recorded across 1,158 auctions this week, while last week there were 988 auctions returning a final clearance rate of 54.1 per cent. This time last year, 1,361 auctions were held across the city, returning a clearance rate of 70.6 per cent. 

There were 850 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary clearance rate of 57.3 per cent although again this will revise down over the week as more results are collected. In comparison, there were 669 auctions held over the previous week and the final auction clearance rate was just 48.6 per cent, the lowest result the city has seen since mid-July. One year ago, 1,033 auctions were held and the clearance rate came in at 65.9 per cent. 

Looking at the smaller auction markets, Adelaide saw an increase in both auction volumes and the preliminary auction clearance rate week-on-week. Canberra and Perth also saw an increase in auction volumes over the week.
 

 

 ",2021_04_23,24-Sep-18,N/A,"Preliminary auction clearance rates hold around the mid 50% range, indicating subdued auction conditions over the first three weeks of spring"
"The recent release of the CoreLogic June quarter Pain and Gain report highlighted the growing divergence between houses and units for loss making resales; units recorded a higher proportion of loss making resales relative to houses across every broad region of Australia over the quarter. 

A summary of gross profit and loss making resales across the country, the Pain & Gain report results show a consistent and long underperformance across the unit sector.  14.3% of units that resold across the capital cities transacted at a gross loss; roughly double the rate of loss making house resales.  Across the combined regional areas of Australia, loss making unit resales comprised 16.1% of transactions while a lower 10.3% of houses resold at a gross loss
 

Every capital city and rest of state region across the country has seen the unit sector record a larger proportion of loss making resales across the unit sector compared with detached housing, however the differential is substantial in those cities where unit values have fallen more materially.

 

 

Across the capital cities, Darwin stands out as showing the highest proportion of loss making unit resales, with 71% of units reselling at a loss over the June quarter.  Considering Darwin unit values have fallen 44% since peaking in May 2010, the high rate of loss on resales should come as no surprise. In fact, Darwin unit values are back to the same level they were in February 2005.  Darwin house values haven’t fall anywhere near as much, down 11% since peaking.  

Regional Western Australia has recorded the second highest level of loss making resales for units (56.7%) followed by Perth at 47.8%.  Both regions have seen unit values fall substantially more than house values. Since peaking in January 2008, regional WA unit values are down 47.5% and now back to levels seen in 1988. In Perth, unit values are 18.2% lower after peaking in July 2013 and are now worth around the same value as they were in May 2006.

Amongst the capital cities, Brisbane stood out for a high rate of loss making unit resales, with 29.2% transacting at a gross loss over the quarter compared with only 4.1% of houses selling at a gross loss. Brisbane unit values are back to where they were in August 2007 after declining by 10.8% from their 2008 peak.  

The lowest rates of loss making unit resales were in those regions where unit values have shown more buoyant conditions.  Hobart recorded the lowest portion of loss making unit resales, with only 2.9% reselling at a gross loss over the June quarter. Hobart unit values are at a record high after recording solid capital gains over the past few years.  It was only five years ago, after a long period of weak housing market conditions, when 25% of Hobart units were reselling at a gross loss.  

The Sydney unit market was showing the second lowest proportion of loss making unit resales over the June quarter.  Despite rising levels of unit supply, only 3.5% of Sydney units resold at a gross loss over the quarter.  Unit values are down 2.6% since peaking in November last year, and values remain 43% higher relative to five years ago.  With a recent history of such strong capital gains, the vast majority of Sydney unit owners are still in a positive value position relative to their purchase price, however as values continue to slip lower and supply levels rise, we are likely to see loss making resales rise.

 

A variety of factors are contributing to the higher proportion of loss making sales across the unit market, including

Units are more likely to be owned by investors.   Around 68% of units are investor owned, 51% of townhouses are owned by investors and only 22% of houses.  CoreLogic Pain and Gain data shows investor owned dwellings have a higher propensity to resell at a loss which is probably attributable to the fact that investors can take advantage of taxation benefits such as offsetting their losses against future capital gains.
Unit markets can be more prone to oversupply.  This trend has been evident across the Brisbane and Melbourne inner city markets to different extents.
Focusing on some of the key inner city unit markets, Brisbane’s inner city recorded 32% of unit resales at a loss over the quarter and Melbourne’s inner city recorded 22% at a loss.  Unit construction has been winding down across Queensland since late 2016, but remains at record levels across Victoria and close to record highs in New South Wales.  With unit values now falling in Sydney and Melbourne and the pipeline at, or close to record highs, we could see loss making resales diverge further in these markets.
We also need to factor in the underlying land value.  Even though dwelling values are sliding in some markets, land prices have generally held firm or continued to trend higher.  Detached houses have a stronger relationship with land values which is likely contributing to the long run trend of higher capital gains for houses relative to units.",2021_04_23,21-Sep-18,N/A,Units Likely to Record Bigger Re-sale Losses than Houses
"The combined capital cities are expecting 65 per cent fewer homes taken to market this week, with half the nation host to an upcoming public holiday, combined with both the NRL and AFL grand finals being held over the weekend, it looks to be a quiet week for the auction markets.

There are 846 capital city auctions currently being tracked by CoreLogic this week, down from the 2,404 held last week and lower than the 969 auctions held over the same week last year.
 

 

Sydney is set to be the busiest auction market this week, with 586 homes scheduled to go under the hammer, down on the 851 auctions held as at final results last week, and only slightly lower than the 607 held one year ago.

The most notable decrease in activity will be in Melbourne, where a very subdued 64 auctions are scheduled this week; a 94.5 per cent drop in volumes from last week’s 1,161 auctions held. The lower activity this week is not unusual, we historically see activity plummet over what is the grand final weekend each year. Over the same week last year 122 auctions took place across the city.

Brisbane is expected to be the second busiest capital city this week, with 80 scheduled auctions, however this is lower than last week’s 124 auctions. The remaining capital cities are all expected to see a lower volume of auctions week-on-week, with the exception of Tasmania where activity will remain steady.

With such low activity in Victoria this week, it is no surprise that the busiest suburbs for auctions are in NSW, with Mosman topping the list with 19 scheduled auctions, followed closely by Randwick (13), Bellevue Hill (11) and Port Macquarie (10).

 

Summary of Last Week’s Results:

Last week saw 2,404 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, returning a final auction clearance rate of 52.4 per cent, increasing from the 51.8 per cent over the week prior which was the lowest seen since Dec-12. Over the same week last year, 2,782 homes went to auction and a clearance rate of 66.2 per cent was recorded. 

 

 

Melbourne’s final clearance rate was recorded at 53.8 per cent across 1,161 auctions last week, compared to 54.1 per cent across a lower 988 auctions over the previous week. This time last year a higher 1,361 homes were taken to auction across the city and a much stronger clearance rate was recorded (70.6 per cent).

Sydney’s final auction clearance rate came in at 51.1 per cent across 851 auctions last week, up from 48.6 per cent across 669 auctions over the previous week. Over the same week last year, 1,033 Sydney homes went to auction returning a final clearance rate of 65.9 per cent. 
Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates improved across Adelaide and Tasmania, while Brisbane, Canberra and Perth saw clearance rates fall week-on-week.
 

Of the non-capital city auction markets, the Geelong region was the best performing in terms of clearance rate (61.1 per cent), followed by the Hunter region where 58.8 per cent of homes sold.

 ",2021_04_23,27-Sep-18,N/A,National Auction Market Snapshot - Week ending 30 September 2018
"The combined capital cities saw an increase in the number of homes taken to auction this week with a total of 1,985 auctions held, up from the week prior when 1,916 auctions took place. The higher week-on-week activity returned a preliminary auction clearance of 55 per cent, which is lower than the previous week’s 55.3 per cent final clearance rate. 

 

 

So far the Spring selling season has seen a lower volume of auctions take place each week relative to the same period last year, demonstrating the reluctance within a softening market, however the weighted average clearance rate has levelled out somewhat; remaining within the low-mid 50 per cent range since May. Given this week’s clearance rate is the lowest preliminary result seen so far this year, it will be interesting to see how this revises as final results are collected. 

 

 

There were 991 Melbourne homes taken to auction this week, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 57.2 per cent. Last week, 891 auctions were held across the city with a higher 60 per cent success rate. While one year ago, a much higher 1,265 homes were taken to auction across the city returning a stronger 71.4 per cent clearance rate.

In Sydney, 52.6 per cent of properties sold this week, up from last week when the final result saw just over half of Sydney homes successful at auction (50.6 per cent). There were a similar volume of auctions held this week compared to last, with 665 homes taken to market, up slightly from the 656 auctions last week as of final figures. Last year, there were 916 Sydney homes taken to auction with 64.2 per cent clearing.

Across the smaller auction markets, Canberra returned the strongest preliminary clearance rate of 68.1 per cent, while only 45.1 per cent of Brisbane homes sold this week.

"CoreLogic has today released the latest onthehouse.com.au First Home Buyers Unit Growth Report which ranks suburbs with a relative close proximity to CBD’s by highest annual growth rate, and price bracket, with a special focus on targeting properties ideal for First Home Buyers.

For First Home Buyers (FHBs), affordability and availability are important, and units offer a far more viable option across these two measures, especially if minimal commuting time is high on the priority list. But FHBs also care about future capital gains for their journey up the property ladder. So for FHB’s, whilst the dream may be a standalone home, the smarts appear to be all about units.

Units are the far better market performer right across the capital city markets when compared to their detached housing counterparts. Whilst house values have continued to decline over the last twelve months (detached homes fell -3.1% in value, while units fell just -0.5%), capital city house prices are still actually 37.5% up on the last five years, making entering the property market increasingly difficult if going for a standalone house. To better understand unit performance, the latest onthehouse.com.au assessed units within a relatively close proximity of the CBD http://propertynews.onthehouse.com.au/firsthomebuyers to identify highest growth suburbs and potential first home buyer areas. The resulting list details top performing suburbs within 30kms from the CBD in three median value brackets: under $350,000, $350,000 - $500,000 and $500,000 - $800,000. This list is ranked from highest to lowest annual growth, providing diverse options for FHB’s across Australia’s capital cities.

Best buys under $350,000:

Perhaps unsurprisingly, only four capital cities met the criteria for ‘under $350k’ price bracket, so pickings are slim (and competition will be fierce), but of those that did, FHBs with tight budgets would do well to consider Hobart, which represented not only the highest value growth but also the most affordable. Units in Claremont and Glenorchy made the top two suburbs, with the lowest median value units ($258,319 and $341,663 respectively) an annual rate of growth of 11.7% and 18.2% respectively, plus just 12kms (Claremont) and 7kms (Glenorchy) to the CBD.

Suburbs in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia also featured in this lower value bracket, but not all had positive growth for those potential future capital gains. Prospect in Adelaide had the highest growth at 4.9%.

Best buys $350,000 - $500,000:

FHBs with slightly deeper pockets have much more choice, with 8 capital cities offering units within 30km’s of the CBD in the $350,000 - $500,000 median value bracket.

Melbourne was home to the best performers, with ten qualifying suburbs recording the highest annual unit value growth across all capital city suburbs. Fawkner topped the list (median value $482,865 and a standout 12 month value growth of 25.1%). Beyond Melbourne, the highest 12 month growth was recorded in Perth’s West Leaderville, with unit values up 8.2%. Brisbane offers opportunity too, with all top 10 suburbs recording positive unit value growth, including Spring Hill, just 1km from the CBD. Some higher value suburbs in this medium value bracket are however seeing negative value growth, reflecting the trend of the top price bracket.

Best buys $500,000 - $800,000:

Melbourne dominates the top median value bracket analysed too, contributing the top 10 suburbs with highest annual growth within this range. Clayton South had the highest growth in units at 21.6% over the year to July 18 and a median value of $540,075.

Perth finally gets a look in (compared to a limited/non-existent showing in the lower two price brackets) with 7 of 9 suburbs included in the analysis recording an increase in value over the year. Units in North Coogee actually out performed all of the remaining capital city suburbs, coming in at 11 place for highest growth with an annual increase in unit values of 9.1%. Sydney suburbs in this price bracket also performed better relative to growth within the $350k-$500k price bracket, with all top suburbs showing an increase in unit values over the 12 months.

"Auction activity is set to rise across the combined capital cities this week, with a total of 2,277 homes scheduled for auction, increasing by 15 per cent on last week’s final figures (1,983), although lower than one year ago when 2,782 capital city homes went to auction.

Melbourne is set to be the busiest auction market this week, with a total of 1,091 homes scheduled for auction, increasing on last week when 988 auctions were held across the city. While one year ago, 1,361 Melbourne homes were taken to auction.  

Volumes are also set to rise across Sydney, with a total of 802 homes scheduled to go under the hammer this week, up on the 669 auctions held last week, however, lower than the 1,033 held one year ago.

Across the smaller markets, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth are all set to see an increase in auction activity, while Brisbane and Tasmania are expected to see fewer auctions take place this week.

The busiest suburbs for auctions this week are Melbourne’s Craigieburn and Reservoir, with 22 and 21 homes scheduled to go under the hammer respectively. Following closely is the Queensland regional suburb of Maroochydore with a total of 19 auctions to be held as part of the annual Ray White coastal living auction event. 
 

Summary of Last Week’s Results:

There were a total of 1,983 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities last week; a slight increase on the week prior when 1,916 auctions were held. The higher volumes last week saw the weighted average clearance rate drop to 51.8 per cent, which was not only lower week-on-week (55.3 per cent), but the lowest seen since Dec-12.
 

 

The two largest auction markets of Melbourne and Sydney both recorded a lower clearance rate week-on-week. Melbourne returned a final clearance rate of 54.1 per cent, down on the 60 per cent over the previous week. While over half of the Sydney homes taken to auction last week failed to sell, returning a final clearance rate of 48.6 per cent, decreasing on the 50.6 per cent over the week prior.  Both markets did see a slightly higher volume of auctions over the week, with volumes across Melbourne up by 10.9 per cent, while Sydney saw a 2 per cent rise in volumes.

As usual the performance across the smaller auction markets was mixed, with Canberra recording the strongest final clearance rate of 65.2 per cent, while only 33.3 per cent of Tasmanian homes sold.  However, Brisbane and Perth were the only auction markets to see a week-on-week improvement in clearance rates.

Across the regional auction markets, Geelong returned the strongest clearance rate of 60.6 per cent. In terms of volumes, the Gold Coast saw the highest number of auctions (58), however only 31.9 per cent sold.

 

Weekly Clearance Rates Combined Capitals

 

 

As usual the performance across the smaller auction markets was mixed last week, with clearance rates improving in Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra, while Perth’s final clearance rate fell.

The Gold Coast region was the busiest non-capital city region last week with 56 homes taken to auction, although only 26.4 per cent sold. Geelong was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with 88 per cent of the 34 auctions successful.

"The combined effect of low rental yields and declining dwelling values has resulted in a rapid reduction in overall returns from housing over the past year.

The CoreLogic Total Returns Index is similar to the ASX200 Accumulation Index in that it measures overall housing market returns.  To do this it measures annual value changes along with annualised gross rental yields to provide the total picture on typical housing returns.  Over recent years value growth has been much stronger that rental returns so the majority of the returns have been achieved via capital gains rather than rental income.  With dwelling values now falling and gross rental yields close to historic lows, the total returns from residential housing are not looking so attractive and a greater share of returns are coming from the yield component.

With national dwelling values having fallen by -1.6% over the 12 months to July 2018, total annual returns have fallen to just 1.9% which is the lowest they’ve been since June 2012.  The fall in total returns has been substantial given that a year earlier total returns were recorded at 14.2%.

Across the combined capital cities, total returns over the 12 months to July 2018 were recorded at 0.8% which was the lowest they’ve been since May 2012.  Total returns across the combined regional markets were recorded at 6.6% over the past year which was the lowest they’ve been since June 2013.  As the chart shows, total returns are falling across the combined capital cities and the combined regional markets with capital city returns falling much faster.  A year ago, annual total returns were recorded at 14.8% across the combined capital cities and 12.0% across the combined regional markets.

Over the past 12 months, total returns in Sydney have fallen by -2.5%.  The -2.5% fall in returns over the year is the weakest result since February 2009 and is a substantial slowdown in annual returns from July 2017 when they had increased by 19.0%.  With dwelling values falling -5.4% in Sydney over the past year it highlights that value changes largely dictate total returns in Sydney.  In regional NSW total returns increased by 6.7% over the past year which was the smallest annual increase since February 2013.  Annual returns in regional NSW have slowed from 17.1% a year ago.

With values falling over the past year in Melbourne there has been a substantial reduction in total returns.  Over the past year, total returns in Melbourne have been recorded at 2.4% which was down from 16.6% a year ago and was also the lowest annual return since October 2012.  Total returns in regional Vic have remained much more stable than those in Melbourne.  Over the past 12 months, total returns in regional Vic have been recorded at 9.8% which was only slightly lower than the 10.4% total returns recorded a year ago.  Value growth is only slightly lower than it was a year ago in regional Vic which is a key contributor to fairly steady total returns.

Over the past year dwelling value growth has slowed across Qld which has contributed to a moderate reduction in total returns.  Over the year, total returns in Brisbane were recorded at 4.8% which was the lowest return since July 2013 and down from 7.5% a year ago.  Regional Qld total returns were slightly stronger than those in Brisbane at 5.2% however, they too were down from 9.1% a year ago and the 5.2% was the smallest annual return since October 2012.

The rate of dwelling value growth has slowed over the past year in Adelaide and so too have total returns while the rate of value decline in regional SA has slowed, providing a boost to total returns.  Total returns in Adelaide were recorded at 4.9% over the past year compared to a 6.1% return in regional SA.  In Adelaide, returns have fallen from 9.9% a year ago and are the lowest they’ve been since June 2013.  Total returns in regional SA have increased from 5.2% a year ago and are the highest they’ve been since January 2017.

Although values have fallen over the past year in both Perth and regional WA, total returns in each region remain positive.  Over the past 12 months, total returns in Perth were recorded at 1.6% which was an increase from 1.2% a year ago however, annual returns have eased slightly over recent months.  In regional WA, total returns were recorded at 0.6% over the past year compared to 1.8% a year ago.

With strong increases in dwelling values over the past year Hobart has recorded the nation’s highest total returns at 17.1%.  Although 17.1% represents much stronger returns than all other capital cities it is lower than the 19.7% a year ago and also lower than the recent peak of 20.2% in September 2017.  Regional Tas has also generated comparatively high total returns over the past year of 12.0%.  The 12.0% annual returns are down from 14.1% a year ago which was the recent peak.

There is a big discrepancy between total returns in Darwin and regional NT which is also reflective of the significant differences in value changes over the past year.  Over the past year, total returns in Darwin were recorded a -0.8% which is down from a positive returns of 2.5% a year ago.  Although total returns are falling, the magnitude of the fall has slowed over the past two months.  In regional NT total returns were recorded at 12.3% which was a substantial improvement on the 1.4% annual return a year ago.

Over the 12 months to July 2018, total returns for Canberra dwellings were recorded at 7.0%.  The 7.0% annual return was lower than the 12.8% recorded over the previous 12 months.  As the chart shows, returns have trended lower over the past year but have begun to stabilize over recent months.

The most recent data shows that there has been a significant fall in investor mortgage demand.  Over recent years most of this demand has been in Sydney and Melbourne, both of which have seen a significant slowdown in total returns over the past year.  Given the decline in returns and an expectation that returns will continue to shrink as values decline further, it is anticipated that investor mortgage demand will also shrink, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Investors could see renewed interest for housing in other regions of the country where total returns remain positive however, the returns are anticipated to be far inferior to those recorded over recent years in Sydney and Melbourne.

"There were 1,400 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 59.1 per cent, while last week, 1,324 auctions were held and the final clearance rate came in at 54 per cent. Over the same week last year, auction volumes were higher with 2,040 homes going under the hammer across the combined capital cities, and the clearance rate was a stronger 67.5 per cent. 

If we look at results by property type, houses outperformed the unit market this week with 60 per cent of houses selling at auction, while 57.1 per cent of units sold across the combined capital cities. An interesting result this week considering so far this year the unit market has consistently been the better performer.

Auction results by property type

In Melbourne, Australia’s largest auction market, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 61.3 per cent was recorded across 718 auctions this week, up from 57 per cent across 629 auctions last week. One year ago, the clearance rate was a stronger 69.8 per cent across 955 auctions. 

 

There were 459 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 59.1 per cent, compared to 51.9 per cent across 462 last week, and 67.6 per cent across 798 auctions one year ago.

"This week, 1,320 capital city auctions are currently being tracked by CoreLogic; remaining relatively steady on last week’s final result which saw 1,324 auctions held. Over the same period one year ago, there was a considerably higher 2,040 homes taken to auction.

As usual, Melbourne is the busiest capital city auction market this week, with 674 homes set to go under the hammer; up from last week’s 628 auctions.

Volumes across Sydney are expected to be lower this week compared to last, with 435 scheduled auctions this week, down on the 456 auctions held last week.

Activity is set to be lower week-on week across Brisbane, Canberra and Tasmania, while Adelaide and Perth will see an increase in the number of auctions held.

All of the busiest suburbs for auctions this week are in Victoria. Malvern East tops the list with 15 homes set to go to auction, followed by Reservoir with 12 scheduled auctions, while Brighton East and Mount Waverley will host 11 auctions each.

Summary of last week's results

Last week, the combined capital cities saw auction volumes fall with a total of 1,324 held, returning a final clearance rate of 54 per cent, down from the previous week when a 55.6 per cent success rate was recorded across 1,536 auctions. While the weighted average was down over the week, combined clearance rates have levelled out somewhat remaining within the low to mid 50 per cent range for 13 consecutive weeks. Despite the continued slowing in the market, clearance rates are still tracking higher each week relative to the same period in 2012; during the last significant downturn in home values. 

Melbourne’s final clearance rate came in at 57 per cent across 629 auctions last week, compared to 58.5 per cent across 802 auctions the previous week. This time last year, 911 Melbourne homes went under the hammer, returning a substantially higher clearance rate of 73.9 per cent.

Sydney’s final auction clearance rate fell to 51.9 per cent across 462 auctions last week, down on the previous weeks 52.4 per cent clearance rate when a similar 469 auctions were held. The same week last year, 620 homes went to auction and a clearance rate of 66.4 per cent was recorded.

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates were varied with Adelaide and Tasmania recording a higher week-on-week result, while Brisbane, Canberra and Perth saw fewer successful auctions.

"Would you let a robot negotiate the sale of your home? That was the question that got an overwhelming “no way” at the INMAN Connect 2018 session on automation and robots in San Francisco recently.

But would you allow a robot to prepare all the background material, check the data, manage the paperwork, and coordinate the grunt work of the work flow so that the agent could focus on the buyers and sellers, supporting the relationship and making sure that the negotiation went smoothly. The answer to that was “absolutely”.

In real estate, the robots most likely to be helping us – especially in the short to medium term – are unlikely to be C3PO or Rosie the Robot from The Jetsons able to compute hyperspace, clean the house and make coffee. Rather they will be background algorithms that are doing one or two tasks to extraordinary levels of efficiency, and handing off to the next step of the process where another algorithm takes over. To the agent as an end user, it will probably feel like a single virtual assistant. But in reality, it’s more likely to be an army of AI minions - hopefully without the chaos in the background.

Here are four startups that CoreLogic met with at INMAN Connect that are working in the automation and robotic space for real estate. 

1.    Robots that create video and reports

Shooting video is time consuming and can be embarrassing – especially if you’ve got a face for radio! Looking up data and writing about the market requires top notch research skills, an eye for detail and a week or two to execute. Australian startup HomePrezzo takes all this pain away by allowing agents to create animated videos about their local markets and properties using the latest market statistics. Once you’ve set up your photo, contact details and branding, you can quickly create videos and reports in under two minutes, and share them across Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or your website and email marketing. Incorporate into your content calendar to extend your digital profile.

2.    Robots that manage your communication

Responding to inquiries is one of the most important thing a real estate agent can do but the myriad of devices where communication now occurs can make agents slaves to their devices – or do the job poorly. Enter Gabbi.ai, which combines all your communications from email, text messages and social media in one place in a chronological timeline - and automates your ability to respond. Gabbi also has chatbot features which allow ‘her’ to book appointments and viewings for you, and respond to basic inquiries. She also plays the role of an assistant, and will create reminders and send reports.

3.    Robots that clean up your data and help you use it better

There are some tasks in real estate that are mind numbingly boring, excruciatingly detail driven and inconsistent in how often and frequently they need to be done. Rita from AIRE is a virtual employee who can be programed to do the tasks listed above that humans do pretty poorly. Some examples of tasks that Rita performs includes entering inquiry data into CRMs, responding to inquiries, cleaning up data, comparing inquiries to names already in your CRM and sending agents lists of leads (derived from the work she has done on inquiries) and providing advice on what to talk to them about. And unlike humans, she doesn’t get distracted and can cope with high workflows without complaint – or even a bathroom break.

4.    Robots that manage your rental inspections

Rental inspections are short and sharp and require extraordinary amounts of coordination both for property managers and potential tenants. But the robot from Zenplace allows a potential tenant to inspect at any time by being located at the property and activating whenever a unique code is typed into a specially fitted doorlock. The robot greets the renter and shows them around. At the other end is an agent who identifies features, and answers questions and can fill in paperwork immediately for tenants who want to proceed. Zenplace claims the efficiency of not having agents on the road to open properties allows them to do 10 times the number of inspections and attract a better quality of tenant.

"Housing finance data for June 2018 was released earlier this week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).  The data showed a continuation of the slowing of demand for housing finance with the slowdown being largely driven by investors.

 
In June 2018 the total value of housing finance commitments was recorded at $31.2 billion which was the lowest monthly value of commitments since January 2016.  The weakness in new housing finance commitments is largely being driven by investors however, the value of lending to owner occupiers also fell over the month.

 
The $31.2 billion in housing finance commitments in June 2018 was made up of $20.8 billion worth of commitments to owner occupiers and $10.4 billion worth of commitments to investors.  The $20.8 billion worth of housing finance commitments to owner occupiers was -1.0% lower over the month and the lowest it has been since October 2017.  Although the value of lending to owner occupiers fell as a share of total lending, owner occupiers accounted for 66.8% of commitments over the month, its greatest share since January 2012.  The $10.4 billion worth of housing finance commitments to investors was the lowest monthly value since August 2013 following a -2.7% monthly decline.  In terms of the total value of housing finance commitments in June 2018, it was -29.7% lower than the April 2015 peak of $14.8 billion.

 
One of the key drivers of housing demand over the past year has been the rebound in demand from the first home buyer segment.  In June 2018 there were 9,541 owner occupier first home buyer finance commitments.  The number of first home buyer commitments fell by -7.4% over the month however, as a share of all owner occupier housing finance commitments first home buyers accounted for 18.1% which was their greatest share since October 2012.  

The rebound in demand from first home buyers has largely emanated from NSW and Vic.  Again, although the number of commitments has generally fallen over the past month, as a share of total owner occupier commitments, first home buyers increased.  The 14.8% share of owner occupier commitment to first home buyers in NSW was the highest share since February 2018 and the second highest share on a monthly basis since October 2012.  In Vic first home buyers accounted for 19.6% of owner occupier finance demand, its greatest share since July 2013.  The share of owner occupier housing finance commitments to first home buyers in June 2018 was higher than the same time last year in all states and territories except for Qld and ACT.
 
Along with the increasing share of commitments going to first home buyers, owner occupier first home buyers are increasingly borrowing larger sums to enter into the market.  As at June 2018 the average loan size for a first home buyer was $349,800 which was both an historic high and 10.1% higher year-on-year.  By comparison, the average loan size for a non-first home buyer owner occupier was a higher $406,900 but up by a lower 5.5% over the past year.  

Across the individual states and territories, average first home buyer loan sizes have increased across the board over the past year.  Considering that dwelling values are falling nationally it seems somewhat counter-intuitive that borrowers would need to take out larger loans to enter the market.  In NSW and Vic state governments have removed stamp duty for buyers under certain price thresholds which potentially means they feel they can borrow more for their purchase.  Across the states and territories, the year-on-year changes in average first home buyer loan sizes were: +5.6% in NSW, +12.1% in Vic, +3.5% in Qld, +12.2% in SA, +4.5% in WA, +18.0% in WA, +1.5% in NT and +15.1% in ACT.

With national dwelling values falling, the data highlights that much of the weakening demand for housing is coming from the investor segment.  Keep in mind that over recent year’s investor participation in the market has been at historic high levels.  Owner occupier demand is also easing albeit at a much more moderate pace than investor demand.  While owner occupier demand is easing overall, first home buyer demand has strengthened over the past year.  With dwelling values declining, it is a little concerning that buyers that typically have relatively little equity are entering a declining market and increasingly borrowing larger sums to enter the market.  With value declining they run a significant risk of seeing their overall wealth decline as housing values trend lower.  The data indicates that more seasoned market participants, such as owner occupier upgraders and investors, are taking a more cautious approach to a market which is in the early stages of value decline.  First home buyers might be wise to take a similar approach as housing market conditions continue to ease.

"Think “Sydney Real Estate” and thoughts immediately go to “pricey”.

With a median house value of $1,012,368 and a median unit value of $752,625, it’s no wonder Australia’s largest capital city is also the most expensive and unaffordable.

However, according to an onthehouse.com.au (a CoreLogic business) report released today, options do still exist under a cool million - purchasers just need to make compromises on lifestyle preferences such as time spent commuting and housing types (houses vs units).

The report analysed data behind distance to the central city and prices to create a list of suburbs that still have housing options available within 30 kilometres from the city centre in three brackets: up to $500,000, $500,000 - $750,000 and $750,000 - $1Million.

On behalf of onthehouse.com.au, spokesperson David Maire comments: “It will surprise no one that at every price bracket, Sydney’s units dominate, with a choice of 143 suburbs in which the median value of units is under $1Million. If your heart is set on a house, your options are much more limited, with just 44 suburbs on the list, the vast majority of which were at least 20 kilometres from the city centre.” If you’ve got less than $500K to spend, the Sydney suburbs of Lakemba and Wiley Park are the most central and affordable options. Both have a median value for units under $500k and are both within 15kms of the CBD.

“You would need at least $500-750k to buy a house in Sydney’s main capital region, however the closest to the CBD you could get would be approximately 29 kilometres away, with the suburb of Busby coming in with the lowest median value for houses at $675,210” Maire notes.

In the $750,000 - $1Million price bracket, the closest you could get to the CBD would be 13 kilometres away in the suburbs of Eastwood and Greenacre where you could buy a unit for around $753,850 and a house for $941,759 respectively. For a full list of suburbs with housing options at under 15km’s, 15-20km’s, 2025km’s, and 20-25km’s from Sydney’s city centre in price brackets of up to $500,000, $500,000 - $750,000 and $750,000 - $1Million, download the full report.

"The Reserve Bank (RBA) has kept official interest rates sitting at 1.5% ever since August 2016 which represents the longest period of cash rate stability on record.  Although official interest rates haven’t moved over this period, investors who have been an increasing source of mortgage demand over recent years, have been incurring higher mortgage rates 2015 as lenders charge a premium for investment loans.  Although the cash rate hasn’t been adjusted for almost two years, the rhetoric from the RBA continues to be that the next move in rates is likely to be up rather than down.  

 
As at August 1, the expectation from the market was that within the next 18 months, which takes us out to the beginning of 2020, official interest rates would be at the same level as they have been since August 2016 (the RBA typically move rates in multiples of 25 basis points).  Should that come to fruition that would be three and a half years whereby there was no adjustment to official rates.  When you consider the unprecedented length of stability we’ve already experienced in the cash rate, it would seem unlikely that whatever the economic conditions are by 2020 it wouldn’t have necessitated a change from the interest rate settings that have been in place since August 2016 (whether that be an increase or a reduction to the cash rate).

You can read the RBA’s charter here but to summarise; the RBA aims to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and that the powers of the Bank are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Reserve Bank Board, will best contribute to:

the stability of the currency of Australia;    
the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and
the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.

Increasingly over recent years the mortgage lending environment and the rate of escalation in dwelling values, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne has been called out by the RBA as risks to the financial stability of the Australian economy.  Direct intervention in the form of macroprudential tools (which the RBA were initially reluctant to endorse) have eventually led to a swift reversal in housing market conditions over the past year.  Over this time, national dwelling values have started to fall and more importantly so too have values in Sydney and Melbourne following a number of years of substantial value growth and investor participation in the housing market has waned.  

 
Higher mortgage rates to investors along with tightened overall credit conditions, higher supply levels and reduced housing affordability in the largest capital cities have been major contributors to the recent declines in dwelling values.  Investor activity has reduced substantially as a result of these measures.  At its peak in May 2015, investors accounted for 54.8% of the total value of new housing finance commitments.  This was before macroprudential controls were fully implemented and also before investors were being charged a mortgage rate premium.  As at May 2018, investors accounted for 42.0% of all new lending which was its lowest share since August 2012 with the 42.0% share sitting right on the two decade average.  

 
The above chart shows the six month change in dwelling values annualised and standard variable mortgage rates over time.  The chart also shows that while mortgage rates for owner occupiers have been steady over recent years the macroprudential tools that have been implemented have led to mortgage rate premiums being applied to investor mortgages.  Probably the most important take-away from the chart is the relationship between mortgage rates and value growth.  As mortgage rates rise, dwelling value growth typically slows and vice versa.  Since the last recession in the early 1990’s there has been a long-term trend to declining interest rates.  At some point that trend will need to be reversed especially as overseas economies begin to normalise interest rates however, breaking the trend may have some significant implications for the housing market. This is especially the case when considering that dwelling values are already falling and to-date it has only been investors and interest-only borrowers that are being charged higher mortgage rate premiums.  It is important to note that owner occupiers remain the biggest source of mortgage demand, accounting for around two thirds of outstanding mortgage credit, to date these buyers (except those with an interest-only mortgage) have little or no change to interest rates.

Given the RBA’s Charter is to contribute to the economic welfare and prosperity of the people of Australia, personally I find it difficult to believe that there is a strong likelihood of any near-term cash rate increases.  In fact, with underlying inflation below the RBA’s target range, low rates of income growth, high rates of underemployment and the largest asset class in the country (residential housing) falling in value, a stable interest rate environment, or potentially even a lower cash rate if mortgage rates track higher and value declines accelerate a potential interest rate cut seems to be a more appropriate course of action at this time.  Especially when you consider that historically, higher mortgage rates result in a further slowing of housing market conditions.  While a decline in dwelling values is not necessarily a bad thing (especially considering how expensive housing is in Sydney and Melbourne) falling dwelling values can also have an impact on spending throughout the rest of the economy as home owners feel the impact of reduced wealth.  

This discussion about the potential for interest rate changes also doesn’t take into consideration the fact that funding costs are increasing for mortgage lenders which is already starting to lead to some mortgage rate increases for borrowers with mortgages from smaller lenders and non-bank lenders (noting that as yet the Big 4 banks have not increased mortgage rates).

"The first week of August sees just over 1,300 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities.

There were 1,316 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 56.2 per cent. Auction volumes were down from last week when 1,536 auctions were held, however the preliminary clearance rate is higher than last week’s final clearance rate which was 55.6 per cent. Over the same week last year, auction volumes were higher with 1,857 homes going under the hammer across the combined capital cities, returning a clearance rate of 68.2 per cent. 

In Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 57.9 per cent was recorded across 628 auctions this week, down from 58.5 per cent across 802 auctions last week. One year ago, the clearance rate was a stronger 73.9 per cent across 911 auctions. 

There were 456 auctions held in Sydney this week, the 4th consecutive week where Sydney has been host to less than 500 auctions, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 56.1 per cent. In comparison, there were 469 auctions held over the previous week and the final auction clearance rate was 52.4 per cent, while one year ago, 620 auctions were held and the clearance rate came in at 66.4 per cent.

"The combined capital cities are expected to see a lower volume of auctions this week with CoreLogic currently tracking 1,224 auctions, down from 1,536 last week and 1,857 over the same week last year. 

Melbourne is set to see volumes fall over the week, with 576 auctions being tracked so far, down from last week when 802 auctions were held across the city and much lower than 12 months ago when 911 homes went under the hammer.

In Sydney, 428 homes are currently scheduled for auction this week, down from 469 last week and lower than the same week last year when 620 auctions were held across the city. 

Auction volumes are lower across each individual capital city when compared to the same week last year, while week-on-week, Canberra and Tasmania are the only places where auction volumes are set to see a slight increase. 

Once again, the busiest suburbs for auctions this week are all in Melbourne. Craigieburn and Reservoir will host 12 auctions each, while Mount Waverley and Richmond are both expecting to see 10 properties go under the hammer.

Summary of last week's results

Last week saw 1,536 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, returning a final auction clearance rate of 55.6 per cent, down from 57.0 per cent across 1,257 auctions the previous week. Over the same week last year, 1,987 homes went to auction and a clearance rate of 68.7 per cent was recorded. 

Melbourne’s final clearance rate was recorded at 58.5 per cent across 802 auctions last week, compared to 59.9 per cent across 613 auctions over the previous week. This time last year 956 homes were taken to auction across the city and a much stronger clearance rate was recorded (75.6 per cent).

Sydney’s final auction clearance rate came in at 52.4 per cent across 469 auctions last week, down from 55.2 per cent across 407 auctions over the previous week. Over the same week last year, 714 homes went to auction returning a clearance rate of 65.4 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates improved across Canberra and Perth, while Brisbane and Adelaide saw clearance rates fall week-on-week. There were no auctions recorded in Tasmania last week.

Of the non-capital city auction markets, the Hunter region was the best performing in terms of clearance rate, with 10 of the 14 reported auctions selling (71.4 per cent), followed by Geelong with a 65.0 per cent clearance rate across 20 results. The busiest region for auctions was the Gold Coast where 39 homes were taken to auction, returning a clearance rate of just 32.3 per cent.

"The decision to keep the official interest rate on hold marks the two year anniversary of the last change to the cash rate by the RBA; the longest period of interest rate stability on record.  The steady rate setting has a lot to do with stubbornly low inflation, record high household debt, a slack labour market and, more recently, falling dwelling values.  Financial markets continue to expect that the cash rate will remain unchanged until at least January 2020.  

While the cash rate has remained stable, mortgage rates have been tweaked, the extent to which depends on the borrower type and loan product.  Over the same period of cash rate stability, the average standard variable mortgage rate has actually reduced by 5 basis points for owner occupiers and increased by 30 basis points for investors.   Three years fixed rates for investors have increased by ten basis points and discounted variable rates are up 40 basis points for investment loans.  Additional mortgage rate premiums are payable for borrowers who aren’t paying down their principal.  Clearly the stability in the cash rate hides a deepening complexity in mortgage products brought about by the heightened level of regulation and focus from both lenders and policy makers on improving credit quality.   

Despite the housing market headwinds from tighter credit conditions, the prospect of mortgage rates remaining reasonably stable should help to keep a floor under housing demand.  
 ",2021_04_23,7-Aug-18,N/A,RBA Sets New Record For Interest Rates
"With the tightening of lending criteria over recent years by lenders there is increasing use of the phrase ‘credit crunch.’  A formal definition of ‘credit crunch’ is inherently loose, however, looking at the data and commentary from the banking regulator APRA, although dwelling values are falling and credit growth has reduced, the term ‘crunch’ might be a little overzealous.

Since late 2014 Australia’s banking regulator APRA along with the Council of Financial Regulators have introduced a series of macroprudential policies which have seen a number of changes to the lending environment.  Some of these major changes include:

A 10% pa speed limit for lenders on investment credit growth (recently lifted for lenders who qualify)
Lenders having to calculate mortgage serviceability on a mortgage rate of 2% above current rates or at least 7% whichever is the greater
A limit of 30% of new mortgage originations for interest-only products along with limits of new interest-only lending on an LVR above 80%
Restrictions on lending growth in higher risk segments of the portfolio (e.g. high loan-to-income loans, high LVR loans and loans for very long terms)
Improved capture and increased scrutiny of borrowers actual expenses rather than using benchmark measures
Stronger verification of borrowers existing debt commitments and income
Reduced risk appetite for new lending at high debt to income levels (greater than 6 times)

As a result of all these changes, the mortgage market has changed.  While the last two decades have largely been about credit becoming more freely available, accessing credit has become less straightfoward. The amount borrowers can borrow relative to their income has generally been reduced, investors and interest-only borrowers are being charged interest rate premiums and the flow of higher LVR lending has reduced.  But has all of this actually led (or is it leading to) a credit crunch?
 

As at the end of May 2018, the value of outstanding housing credit to Australian lenders was recorded at a historic high of $1.762 trillion.  This represents the total value borrowed for housing and as the chart above shows, growth is certainly slowing but it is still expanding.  Over the 12 months to May 2018 housing credit has increased by 5.8% which is its slowest annual growth since February 2014.  This is split between a 7.9% increase in owner occupier credit and a 2.0% increase in investor credit.  While owner occupier credit growth has slowed marginally over the past few months, the annual growth rate is actually a bit higher than a year ago.  The annual rate of growth in investor credit is historically low, highlighting that investor mortgage demand is being impacted more so than owner occupier demand in light of the tightened credit policies.

Another potential reason for the slowing of credit growth for investors is that an increasing number are switching from interest-only mortgages to principal and interest because of the mortgage rate saving.  As a result the principal is now being repaid and outstanding credit is reducing whereas in the past there was no reduction of the principal.  

Unfortunately outside of switching (ie voluntarily transitioning from interest only payments to principal and interest payments) data which most big banks report quarterly to the market there is no regular publicly available data on switching across the whole market.

While total housing credit is important to consider when looking at any ‘credit crunch’ scenario, so too is the flow of new lending.  Each month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publishes housing finance commitments data which highlights the flow of new lending by Australian ADIs.  Unfortunately, only owner occupier data is shown by volumes so in order to look at the whole market, measuring the value of commitments is the only way to do this.  Of course as the cost of housing rises borrowers need to take out larger loans so you do see a strong increasing trend in the value of lending over time.

 
Based on the monthly data there was $31.9 billion worth of housing finance commitments in May 2018 which was the highest monthly value in three months.  The $31.9 billion was -5.5% lower than its historic high monthly value of $33.7 billion in August 2017.  Looking at the three components shown in the above chart, in May 2018 there was; $14.9 billion in commitments to owner occupiers (ex-refinances), $6.3 billion for owner occupier refinances and $10.7 billion for investors.  Investor housing finance commitments were the only one of these categories to record a fall over the month.  Compared to their historic monthly peaks, owner occupier (ex-refinance) commitments are -1.8% lower than their peak in November 2017, owner occupier refinances are -13.1% lower than their peak in December 2015 and investor commitments are down -27.5% from their peak in April 2015.  

Focussing on the two major sources of demand (owner occupier ex-refinances and investors) it is interesting to go back and look at what has happened during other recent periods of lending contraction.

For owner occupier (ex-refinance) housing finance commitments, the value of lending fell by the following percentages during the following periods:

From April 1994 to April 1995 lending fell -29.4% (cash rate moved from 4.75% to 7.5%)
From February 2000 to October 2000 lending fell -25.9% (cash rate moved from 5.5% to 6.25%)
From September 2003 to January 2004 lending fell -15.8% (cash rate moved from 5.0% to 5.25% while Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were starting to slow)
From June 2007 to August 2008 lending fell -31.0% (cash rate rose from 6.25% to 7.25%) 
From September 2009 to March 2012 lending fell -27.9% (cash rate rose from 3.0% to 4.25%)

Looking at investors, the value of lending fell by the following percentages during the following periods:

From January 2000 to October 2000 lending fell by -33.0% (cash rate moved from 5.0% to 6.25%)
From October 2003 to June 2004 lending fell by -27.3% (cash rate moved from 5.0% to 5.25% while Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were starting to slow)
From June 2007 to February 2009 lending fell by -32.2% (cash fell rose from 6.25% to 3.25% but not before rising to 7.25%)
From May 2010 to April 2011 lending fell by-16.8% (cash rate rose from 4.5% to 4.75%).
Clearly there have been previous periods when credit dropped sharply and materially, however the current trend in credit is not as severe.

When analysing the current flows in credit data it is fair to say that there has been a credit crunch for investors but a credit crunch is not really evident for owner occupiers.  Another point to consider for investors is that this cohort have been most active in Sydney and Melbourne; as values have begun to decline in these cities investor demand has waned and has not really increased elsewhere.  What is unknown is whether it is market conditions that have led to the fall in in investor demand or is it the fall in investor demand that has led to the decline in values, in reality it is probably a combination of both.

While investor demand could be characterised as experiencing a crunch at the moment, owner occupier demand, for now, remains quite solid.  Keep in mind that in terms of outstanding credit to lenders, owner occupiers account for 66.5% so a crunch in investor demand has less of an impact on overall credit demand than a crunch in owner occupier demand does.  Nevertheless, the expectation is that dwelling values in Sydney and Melbourne will continue to fall over the coming months which will continue to place downwards pressure on the headline growth rates, given the significant weighting applied to Sydney and Melbourne due to the larger number of dwellings in these cities.  Given this, the overall value of housing finance commitments is anticipated to fall and the expansion in housing credit will likely continue to slow.

"The final week of July returns a preliminary auction clearance rate of 58.4 per cent across the combined capital cities.

The final week of July saw 1,534 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 58.4 per cent. Last week, the final auction clearance rate came in at 57.0 per cent across 1,257 auctions, the highest clearance rate seen since the week ending 13 May 2018, although volumes were much higher then. Although auctions are slowly starting to pick up across the capital cities, current volumes remain lower than this time last year when 1,987 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 68.7 per cent was recorded. 

There were 803 auctions held in Melbourne this week with a preliminary clearance rate of 60.3 per cent, after last week saw 613 homes go under the hammer, returning a final clearance rate of 59.9 per cent. Over the same week last year, 956 auctions were held across the city and a clearance rate of 75.6 per cent was recorded.

Sydney was host to 465 auctions this week with preliminary results showing a clearance rate of 56.6 per cent. Last week, the final auction clearance rate for Sydney was 55.2 per cent across 407 auctions after the previous week saw the clearance rate drop to just 46.9 per cent. When the final results are released later in the week, it’s likely that the final clearance rate for Sydney will revise down to the low 50 per cent mark.

Auction results by property type

Across the smaller auction markets, the highest preliminary clearance rate was recorded in Canberra where 72.2 per cent of the 36 reported auctions were successful. With the exception of Tasmania where no auctions were held this week, Canberra was the only city to see a fall in auction volumes with 46 auctions held across the city this week, down from 52 last week.

"The final week of July will see a total of 1,430 homes taken to auction; a slight increase on the 1,257 auctions held last week as at final figures, although lower than the 1,987 auctions held on the same week last year.

While it is not unusual to see auction activity cool off throughout the winter period, this year has seen weekly volumes trend lower when compared to the equivalent June- July period last year. With clearance rates at their lowest levels since 2012 there is some clear reluctance in the auction market as capital city dwelling values soften.

Melbourne is set to be the busiest auction market this week, with 746 homes scheduled for auction, rising from the 613 held last week.  While over the same week last year a higher 956 auctions took place.

In Sydney, 443 homes are scheduled for auction this week, increasing on the 407 held last week and lower than the 714 auctions held one year ago.

Across the smaller auction markets, Brisbane and Perth will see a higher volume of homes taken to auction this week, while Canberra and Tasmania have fewer scheduled auctions and activity across Adelaide will remain steady. 

This week, all of busiest suburbs for auctions are in Victoria, topping the list with 18 scheduled auctions is Reservoir, followed closely by Craigieburn were 17 homes are set to go under the hammer, while Glen Waverley will host 11 auctions. 

Summary of last week's results


The combined capital cities returned a final auction clearance rate of 57 per cent last week, improving on the 52 per cent over the week prior across a similar volume of auctions.  There were 1,257 homes taken to auction last week, increasing slightly on the 1,178 held the previous week.  While one year ago, a higher 1,748 auctions were held with a 69.9 per cent success rate. 


Melbourne returned a final auction clearance rate of 59.9 per cent across 613 auctions last week, increasing on the 56.2 per cent over the week prior when fewer auctions were held (559).
 
Sydney’s final auction clearance rate came in at 55.2 per cent last week, rising on the week prior when the city returned the lowest reading since Dec-2012 with only 46.9 per cent of auctions successful. Auction volumes were virtually unchanged over the week with a total of 407 held. 

As usual the performance across the smaller auction markets was mixed last week, with clearance rates improving in Adelaide and Brisbane, while Canberra, Perth and Tasmania saw clearances rates fall week-on-week.

The Gold Coast region was the busiest non-capital city region last week with 49 homes taken to auction, although only 33.3 per cent sold. Geelong was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with 61.5 per cent of the 32 auctions successful.

"Property management is feeling the effects of disruption – both technical and generational - with a host of new tech businesses reimagining rental and investment experiences.

The INMAN Connect 2018 conference in San Francisco featured a host of startups that are changing business models, making renting more flexible for tenants, providing transparency around a greater range of investment opportunities and removing a lot of the friction, pain and cost from the traditional processes of property management. 

The demand for this, they claim, is coming from millennials, who have high expectations on standards of living, but value experiences over security, and want flexible leases, great locations and easy ways to book and confirm.  

The drivers are big data pushing into tech enabled platforms that give property managers oversight into every element of the property, collate and respond to information in real time and deconstruct the transaction with security.

The days of setting up a 15-minute inspection window for every potential tenant interested in a property are over with the robot from Zenplace. Zenplace is a property management disrupter that uses technology to find tenants and manage rentals more quickly and affordably than traditional agency models. Their latest offer, the ZenBot, is located within each of their properties to rent. Interested parties can then make an appointment to inspect any time, a unique code is sent to their phone to unlock the door and the robot greets them and shows them around. At the other end is an agent who identifies features, and answers questions and if the tenant wants to proceed, they can fill in paperwork immediately on the screen. Zenplace claims the efficiency of not having agents on the road to open properties allows them to do 10 times the number of inspections and attract a better quality of tenant. But if you’ve got stairs, you’ll need two robots. 

2.    Introducing corporate housing

Landlords want good tenants and long term leases. Tenants want shorter leases in good properties and great locations that feel like home. Companies want to be able to attract great talent and get them settled into new roles in new locations quickly and easily. To date, furnished apartments have been the only – rather soulless and expensive - option. Enter Zeus Property Management.

Zeus signs master leases with landlords of 2 years or longer. They design, furnish and maintain the property for corporate tenants who can place employees into properties in good neighbourhoods quickly and easily with more flexibility. For landlords, the benefits are proactive maintenance, low fees, guaranteed rent and great quality tenants. Tenants get to live in great properties for times that suit their work assignments and without the hassle of leases that lock them in and corporates can swap staff in and out.

3.    Deconstructing shared living

Shared houses have historically had a dodgy reputation – a group of near strangers living under one roof, and often one lease, with second hand furniture and dubious standards of hygiene and arguments over the bills. But that was before the Millennials took over the world with their expectations of ease, comfort, flexibility and constant access to wifi. Common offers shared housing for the new generation. Private furnished bedrooms within beautiful shared suites one all-inclusive rate covering your rent, cleaning and essentials and flexible leases. And of course, it wouldn’t be a tech play if your co-tenants weren’t screened for compatibility using big data. Common is currently available in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington and Seattle but expanding quickly.

4.    Investing in holiday homes

Many is the family who have told themselves that their ideal holiday home is “really a great investment” at purchase time, only to find the constant overheads, maintenance and sporadic rent turn the dream into a nightmare. 

But Vacasa is a property management concept that specialises in vacation homes – a supported property management version of AirBnB if you will. It screens travellers, manages guests, promotes bookings, and manages property maintenance to a high standard, driven by a technology platform that adjusts rates in real time using data from local events, seasonal patterns and market demand. Vacasa claims landlords earn 34% more rent on average in their first year. 

In addition, Vacasa works with local agents in each area to help their buyers understand the holiday rental potential of a property by providing the data and insights to support the decision. 

So the next time you fall in love with a cottage by the sea, Vacasa can help you understand exactly how many days it’s likely to be rented, peak times, rates and returns you should expect, as well as advice on renovations or improvements that will affect rents so you can remove any guess work from understanding its investment potential.

"With capital city dwelling values falling, the market is responding with fewer new listings however, total listings remain elevated compared to other recent years when housing conditions were much stronger.

The number of properties advertised for sale is an important indicator to consider when undertaking analysis of the housing market.  When reporting on listings CoreLogic refers to new listings and total listings.  New listings refer to properties that have previously not been advertised for sale over the past six months whereas total listings include new listings and re-listings that have been advertised ongoing.  CoreLogic listings data comes from many sources, given that the same property may be listed a number of times from different sources.  The data presented counts a listed property only once.  CoreLogic’s listings counts are based on a rolling 28 day count of listings. 

The charts contained within this Pulse show listings across each of the past seven years.  The x-axis represents the time of year and the y-axis shows the number of properties listed for sale.  By presenting the data like this you can compare where listings are at any point in time to the corresponding time in other years. 

The other point to note about the listings data is that it tends to be highly seasonal.  Listings fall dramatically during Christmas and New Year and then pick up through autumn.  They then tend to fall during Winter and then rise substantially coming into Spring and remain elevated until late in the year.

Combined capital cities - Over the 28 days to 22 July 2018 there were 21,849 new properties listed for sale and 108,436 total properties listed for sale.  The number of new listings was -6.7% lower than the previous year and total listings were 7.2% higher.  New listings are lower than they’ve been at this time of year, any year since 2012.  Total listings are higher than they’ve been at this time of year since 2012.

Sydney

There were 5,601 new properties listed for sale over the past 28 days which was -13.1% fewer than a year ago but slightly higher than the number in 2016.  There were 26,103 total properties listed for sale which was 21.7% higher than last year and the most for sale since this time in 2012 when CoreLogic was tracking 29,366 properties on the market.

Melbourne

Over the past 28 days there were 6,821 new properties listed for sale and 30,029 total properties for sale.  Compared to a year ago new listings are -4.8% lower and tracking at the lowest level for this time of year since 2014.  Total listings are 10.5% higher than a year ago and are also the highest they’ve been since 2014.

Brisbane

The 3,789 new properties listed for sale is -3.2% lower than a year ago and the fewest new listings since this time of year in 2012.  There are 19,738 total properties listed for sale which is 1.2% higher than a year ago and the highest at this time of year since 2012.

Adelaide

Over the past 28 days there were 1,646 new properties listed for sale and 7,798 total properties listed for sale.  New listings are -8.5% lower than a year ago and the lowest they’ve been at this time of year any year since 2012.  Total listings are -2.8% lower than they were a year ago and the lowest they’ve been at this time of year since 2014.

Perth

With 3,007 newly listed properties over the past 28 days, new listings are -1.0% lower than a year ago and haven’t been this low since 2012.  Total listings are somewhat different with 20,618 listings which is 1.7% higher than last year but lower than 2016 and higher than every other year since 2012.

Hobart

Over the past 28 days there were 344 new and 951 total properties listed for sale.  The 344 new listings was up 8.5% on a year ago and the highest at this time of year since 2013.  The 951 total properties listed for sale is -23.6% lower than a year ago and sitting at an historic low level.

Darwin

There were 176 new properties listed for sale and 1,446 total properties for sale over the past 28 days.  New listings are -3.3% lower than a year ago and while they are slightly higher than in 2016 they are lower than every other year since 2012.  Total listings are -11.8% lower than a year ago and are lower than they have been over each of the past 3 years.

Canberra

Over the past 28 days there were 465 new properties listed for sale which was -18.4% fewer than a year ago and the lowest number of new listings at this time of year since 2016.  There were 1,753 total properties listed for sale which was -4.9% lower than a year ago and the lowest at this time of year compared to each year since 2012, except for 2016.

Across most capital cities the number of new listings is lower than they were a year ago.  This is most likely a response to reduced demand for housing currently, as a result potential vendors are holding off bringing stock to market.  At the same time, in softening markets such as Sydney and Melbourne, total listings are much higher than over recent years highlighting that although fewer new listings are entering the market the stock that is for sale is proving more difficult to sell.

The real litmus test for the housing market will be what happens in Spring, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.  If, as usually occurs, new listings ramp-up and a lot more stock becomes available for sale this could create further downwards pressure on values.  Don’t be surprised though if with tightened credit and an already weakening housing market that Spring this year is a lot more muted than what we’ve seen over recent years.

"In previous instances when value growth has slowed or started to fall in Sydney and Melbourne the experience has often been that value growth has ramped-up in other capital cities.  This makes sense given that as affordability deteriorates in certain areas of the country people start to turn their attention elsewhere.  

This week’s blog takes a look at the comparative value of housing in other capital cities and nearby markets relative to in Sydney and Melbourne.

 
Sydney is the nation’s most expensive capital city housing market currently with the median dwelling value in June 2018 recorded at $870,554.  The premium for the median dwelling value in Sydney relative to the other national capital cities is: 21% for Melbourne, 76% for Brisbane, 98% for Adelaide, 89% for Perth, 99% for Hobart, 101% for Darwin and 48% for Canberra.  With dwelling values in Sydney now falling, the premium is reducing however, the cost of housing in Sydney relative to other capital cities is generally significantly higher than the long-term averages.  In fact only Melbourne (42%) and Hobart (103%) have a current differential which is lower than the long-term average.

 
Of course, people that potentially migrate out of Sydney don’t necessarily only choose to go interstate, they may also migrate intrastate.  The above chart highlights the value differential over time between Sydney and those regions adjoining the city as well as the Capital Region (adjoining Canberra) and Richmond-Tweed (adjoining South-East Queensland).  The premium for Sydney dwellings compared to those in the other regions highlighted is currently: 105% for Capital Region, 176% for Central West, 113% for Hunter Valley exc Newcastle, 29% for Illawarra, 52% for Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, 64% for Richmond-Tweed and 47% for Shoalhaven.  Although values have increased in regional NSW over the past year, the rate of growth has slowed substantially, particularly within Illawarra, Newcastle and Lake Macquarie and Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven.  These three regions have been seeing strong value growth over the past five years and they are also the only three regions in which the value differential is lower (substantially so) than the long-term average.

 
Looking at the value differential between Melbourne and other capital cities, except Sydney, Melbourne’s median dwelling value of $716,774 is higher than all other capital cities.  The premium for Melbourne is currently recorded at: 45% for Brisbane, 63% for Adelaide, 55% for Perth, 64% for Hobart, 65% for Darwin and 22% for Canberra.  The value differential for Melbourne to all these capital cities is greater than the long-term average.  In fact, notwithstanding the recent slight reductions due to Melbourne value falls, the value gap between Melbourne and Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide and Melbourne and Darwin is the largest it has ever been.  

 
The above chart looks at the dwelling value premium for Melbourne relative to the major regional areas adjoining the capital city.  Melbourne retains a significant premium in terms of housing costs relative to these areas.  What is very different to what was shown in the chart for Sydney and Regional NSW areas is that outside of Geelong, the housing cost premium in Melbourne remains well above the long-term average.  This suggests that while value growth has been rippling out of Melbourne to Geelong for some time, it has only just started to spill-out into the other three regions recently.  The current premium for Melbourne dwellings relative to the other regions is: 99% for Ballarat (80% long-term average), 100% for Bendigo (74% long-term average), 29% for Geelong (40% long-term average), 123% for Latrobe-Gippsland (89% long-term average). 

There are some explainable reasons why dwelling values in Sydney and Melbourne have risen so substantially over recent years.  These include but are not limited to: strong rates of migration to the cities, dramatically increased foreign investors, low mortgage rates, increased demand from investors and much stronger economic conditions than elsewhere in the country.  The latest data shows a pull-back in net overseas migration, slowing interstate migration to NSW and Vic, foreign investment has reduced, fewer local investors and reduced availability of credit for housing despite still low mortgage rates.  Sydney and Melbourne still have comparatively strong economies but we have started to see the economic performance elsewhere improve.  Sydney and Melbourne have also seen a dramatic reduction in housing affordability over recent years as dwelling values have increased much faster than household incomes.  The value gap between Sydney and Melbourne and other regions doesn’t necessarily mean that value growth will pick-up elsewhere where dwelling values are much lower.  However, if other areas of the country can improve their economic performance, the lure of much more affordable housing may be enough of a lure to see an increasing number of Sydneysiders and Melbournians to migrate away from these two cities to other areas of the country.

"Auction volumes remain low week-on-week while the preliminary clearance rate improves across the combined capital cities.

Auction volumes increased slightly over the week with 1,246 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, up from 1,178 last week. The preliminary clearance rate was recorded at 60.6 per cent this week, after finalised clearance rates have held between 52.0 - 52.6 per cent for the last 3 weeks. Although the clearance rate tends to revise down over the week as final results are collected, we still expect there to be a modest improvement week-on-week.

 

Melbourne was the busiest city for auctions this week, with 612 homes going under the hammer, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 62.3 per cent, compared to last week when 56.2 per cent of the 559 auctions were successful. Over the same week last year, there were 833 auctions held in Melbourne, returning a clearance rate of 73.8 per cent. 

There were 400 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 61.3 per cent. In comparison, last week there were 408 auctions held and a final clearance rate of just 46.9 per cent, the lowest clearance rate the city has seen since December 2012. This time last year, 70.3 per cent of the 625 auctions held were successful. 

Auction results by property type

Across the smaller auction markets, the highest preliminary clearance rate was recorded in Adelaide where 75.0 per cent of the 48 reported auctions were successful.

"Auction activity is expected to remain relatively subdued this week with 1,155 homes scheduled for auction across the combined capital cities, similar to the 1,178 auctions held last week, although lower than this time last year when 1,748 homes were taken to auction. 

Looking at the individual capital cities, auction volumes are similar week-on-week with Melbourne and Tasmania set to see an increase in the number of homes taken to auction while Canberra is expecting no change in auction volumes. 

Melbourne is set to be the busiest auction market this week, with a total of 569 homes scheduled for auction, similar to last week when 559 auctions were held across the city but lower than 12 months ago when 833 homes went under the hammer in Melbourne.

In Sydney, 386 homes are currently scheduled for auction this week, down from 408 last week and lower than the same week last year when 625 auctions were held across the city. 

The busiest suburbs for auctions this week are all in Melbourne. Topping the list with 16 scheduled auctions is Reservoir, followed by Bentleigh East with 13 and Glenroy with 11, while Craigieburn and Mount Waverley will host 10 auctions each this week.

Summary of last week's results

Last week saw 1,178 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, returning a clearance rate of 52.0 per cent after the previous week recorded a clearance rate of 52.6 per cent across 1,411 auctions. Over the same week last year, 1,627 homes were taken to auction and the clearance rate was a stronger 69.4 per cent.

Melbourne’s final clearance rate came in at 56.2 per cent across 559 auctions last week, similar to the previous week when 631 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 56.1 per cent was recorded. This time last year auction volumes were higher across the city with 756 homes going under the hammer returning a clearance rate of 74.9 per cent. 

Sydney’s final clearance rate dropped to 46.9 per cent last week across 408 auctions, the lowest clearance rate the city has seen since December 2012. In comparison, 552 auctions were held across Sydney over the previous week returning a clearance rate of 50.1 per cent while this time last year, 609 homes went under the hammer, returning a clearance rate of 69.2 per cent.

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates improved everywhere except Brisbane. In terms of volumes, Adelaide was the only city to see an increase with an additional 8 homes taken to auction over the week. 

Of the non-capital city markets, the Hunter region recorded a 70.6 per cent final auction clearance rate across 17 results, followed closely by Geelong where 70.4 per cent of the 27 auction results were successful.

"Over the past decade there has been a significant change in house and unit values throughout each of Australia’s largest sub-state regions (best known as SA4).

Our findings found that over the 10 years to June 2018, national dwelling values have increased by a cumulative 43.9% with the combined capital cities recording an increase of 52.6% and the combined regional markets recording growth of 16.6%.

Houses values increased by 46.9% nationally over the past decade with combined capital city values growing at a faster pace (56.2%) than the combined regional markets (20.0%) Of the 88 regions SA4 national regions, 73 areas recorded an increase in dwelling values over the past decade with the remaining 15 recording falls.  No SA4 regions of NSW, Vic, Tas, NT or ACT have recorded a decline in values over the past decade.  Meanwhile, a majority of the WA SA4 regions have recorded declines in values over the past decade.

The region to record the greatest increase in house values over the past decade was the South West region of Sydney where values increased 112.9% over the period.  An additional five SA4 regions have seen house values double over the past decade, they were: Parramatta in Sydney (107.4%), Inner South West of Sydney (106.6%), Outer South West of Sydney (103.3%), South East of Melbourne (102.7%) and the West region of Melbourne (102.3%).

The regions of the country in where house values recorded the largest decline over the past decade were: 

Outback (North) in WA (-38.3%)
Outback (South) in WA (-34.0%)
Mackay-Isaac-Whitsunday in Qld (-27.3%)
Central Queensland (-26.8%) 
Townsville (-23.6%)

Only 3 capital city SA4 regions, all of which are in Perth, have recorded house value falls over the past decade.  

Value growth in NSW and Vic has been substantially stronger than growth elsewhere.  In fact, the regions of NSW (Riverina) and Vic (North West) that recorded the weakest conditions over the decade have seen value growth well in excess of the best performing WA region (Perth-North West).

Outside of NSW and Vic, the regions with the strongest value growth across the remaining states and territories over the decade were: Brisbane-South (30.2%), Adelaide-West (20.3%), Perth-North West (2.2%), South East in Tas (43.9%), Outback in NT (35.2%) and ACT (30.3%).  

Illawarra in NSW recorded the greatest increase in house values of all regional markets over the past decade with values increasing 86.8%. Illawarra recorded the 15th highest rate of house value growth over the past decade nationally. 

The remaining regional markets that recorded relatively large increases in house values were: 

Geelong (79.6%)
Southern Highlands 
Shoalhaven in NSW (77.9%)
Newcastle and Lake Macquarie (68.6%) 
Bendigo in Vic (63.3%)

Looking at unit values, nationally throughout the past decade, units increased by 34.2% which is lower than the 46.9% increase in house values.  Unit value growth in the combined capital cities (42.0%) and combined regional housing markets (0.4%) was similarly lower than that for houses (56.2% and 20.0% respectively).

Of the 88 SA4 regions across the country, 53 have recorded an increase in unit values over the past decade with the remaining 35 recording a fall.

The South West region of Sydney recorded the greatest increase in house values of all SA4 regions (112.9%) and it has also recorded the greatest increase in unit values (98.0%).  While seven regions of the country have recorded a doubling of house values over the past decade, not one region has seen unit values double over the same period.  Only the Outer South West region of Sydney (81.0%) and Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs (78.2%), along with Sydney’s South West have recorded decade unit value growth of more than 75%.  By comparison, over the past decade, 24 regions of the country have recorded house value growth in excess of 75%.

Unit values have recorded the largest declines over the past decade in: 

Outback (North) WA (-73.3%), Outback (South) WA (-65.7%)
Darling Downs-Maranoa in Qld (-52.9%)
Central Queensland (-45.8%) 
Townsville (-45.6%) 

For the regions where unit values dropped, 15 were capital city regions with the remaining 20 located in regional areas of the country.  The capital city unit markets that recorded the greatest unit value falls were: Darwin (-26.0%), Ipswich in Qld (-23.5%), Logan-Beaudesert in Qld (-22.1%), Moreton Bay-South (-20.5%) and Perth-Inner (-19.5%).

Outside of NSW, the regions of each state and territory to record the greatest increase in unit values over the past decade were: Melbourne-Outer East (63.1%), Outback region of Qld (28.7%), South East region of SA (41.0%), Wheat Belt region of WA (54.9%), South East region of Tas (63.3%), Outback region of NT (28.7%) and ACT (11.6%).

Outside of the capital cities, the regional markets that have recorded the greatest increase in unit values over the past decade were: South East in Tas (63.3%), Illawarra in NSW (60.2%), Far West and Orana in NSW (55.7%), Wheat Belt in WA (54.9%) and Bendigo in Vic (46.2%).

The growth in house and unit values over the past decade has been characterised as very much slanted to strong growth in Sydney and Melbourne and weaker conditions elsewhere.  

While the last 10 years is not predictive of the future, dwelling values are already falling in Sydney and Melbourne and regional markets are currently outperforming capital cities.  

With housing in a downturn in Sydney and Melbourne and affordability stretched, at this point it seems unlikely the returns of the past decade will be replicated over the next 10 years.

"There is no doubt that the Brisbane apartment market has been doing it tough.  High supply levels across key inner city suburbs coupled with soft economic conditions, relatively low investment activity and soft rental conditions have resulted in Brisbane unit values consistently falling.  In fact, based on CoreLogic’s hedonic index results for June ‘18, Brisbane unit values were 10.6% lower than their previous peak, which was more than ten years ago in March 2008.

While high supply levels persist, Brisbane’s construction cycle for units has been winding down for almost two years.  As at March this year, there were 22,900 units underway across Queensland, with the majority of these projects based in Brisbane; 30% below the September 2016 peak when 32,550 units were being built.

As construction winds down, population growth is ramping up, providing additional demand for housing.  Queensland is leading the nation for interstate migration, with residents arriving from other states and territories reaching the highest level since December 2005.  

CoreLogic indices have already shown some early signs of a recovery across the Brisbane unit market.  Unit values are up 1.2% over the first half of 2018, outperforming the detached housing sector where values have remained virtually flat (+0.1%) and annual growth has moved back into positive territory.  

 
Buyers are likely to be attracted to the fact that unit prices are currently roughly equivalent to what people were paying in mid-2007.   There is also the strong rental yield, which is averaging 5.3% gross across the Brisbane apartment market; 153 basis points higher than Sydney yields and 132 basis points higher than Melbourne yields.  The higher yield, lower entry point and potentially stronger growth prospects may pique the interest of investors, especially considering the dimmer prospects for value growth in Sydney and Melbourne as these markets move through their down phase.

Prospective buyers should still use some caution, particularly around the inner city markets where supply levels remain high.  Buyers are certainly in the driver’s seat, so vendors will need to be realistic about their price expectations and expect some tough negotiation to be had.

"This week’s blog takes a look at the performance of dwelling values across the most populous coastal housing markets nationwide.

While overall regional housing markets have recorded greater value growth over the past year (+2.2%) than the combined capital cities (-1.6%), value growth in regional markets is slowing.  This is particularly apparent across some of the more populous coastal markets of NSW.  In this week’s blog we look at the change in dwelling values over time across the major coastal housing markets outside of the capital cities and provide an update on how they are tracking.

Although dwelling values in across the Illawarra region of NSW increased by 1.4% over the past three months, values have risen by just 1.1% over the past year.  The 1.1% annual increase in values is substantially lower than the 17.6% increase a year ago.  In fact, the annual growth rate over the most recent 12 month period is the slowest since April 2013.  The Illawarra market is showing a similar slowing trend to that which has been experienced in Sydney and values are already -0.3% lower than their September 2017 peak.

Dwelling values on the Mid North Coast of NSW, which stretches from the Great Lakes region north to Nambucca, have increased by 0.9% over the past three months and are 2.0% higher over the past year.  The 2.0% annual rise in values is much lower than the 9.6% increase a year ago and the slowest annual rate of growth since August 2013.  Although values are still increasing, the growth trend is clearly softening.

The accompanying chart highlights that there is a rapid deceleration in growth occurring in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie region of NSW.  Over the past quarter, values have increased by 0.1% and they are 4.1% higher over the past year.  Like other regions of NSW, the slowdown in value growth over the past year has been substantial; a year ago the annual growth rate was tracking 15.0%.  Dwelling values in the Newcastle Lake Macquarie region are currently -0.3% lower than their April 2018 peak.

Although Richmond-Tweed is in NSW, it tends to be more closely linked with the performance of the adjoining Gold Coast housing market.  Values are still increasing, up 0.2% over the quarter and 1.6% higher over the year however, growth has slowed markedly from an 11.5% annual increase a year ago.  The annual rate of growth has bounced slightly higher lately due to a moderate pick-up in value growth over the past quarter.

Geelong in Vic has seen the most rapid growth in values of all regional markets in the country over the past year.  Over the period, values have increased by 11.0% and the rate of growth is slightly higher than the 10.7% increase a year ago. It is interesting to note that the quarterly rate of growth in values has slowed over the past three months; while the pace of capital gains remains rapid, there are some early signs that growth conditions are starting to moderate.

The Cairns housing market has seen very little growth in dwelling values of late.  In fact, over the past decade, values have fallen by -5.4% and the market remains -9.2% lower than the January 2008 peak.  Over the past three months, values have fallen by -0.6% and over the past year they are -1.0% lower.  12 months ago, Cairns dwelling values had increased by 0.8% indicating that overall housing market conditions have recorded a subtle slowdown over the past year.

Gold Coast’s housing market has seen value growth slow significantly over the past 12 months.  A year ago, values were rising at the annual pace of 6.5% while over the past year, values have increased by only 1.4%, their slowest annual rate of growth since May 2013.  Values are -0.1% lower over the quarter and were -0.4% lower over the past month.   Although recent growth has not been at the heights seen in regional NSW housing markets and Sydney and Melbourne, the annual rate of value growth peaked at 7.1% in December 2015.

The Sunshine Coast is the strongest housing market in Qld for value growth with values rising by 1.1% over the past three months to be 5.5% higher over the past year.  Although values were 5.5% higher over the year, this was a slight slowdown on the 5.9% increase in values over the previous year.  Although values are continuing to climb, it is occurring against a back-drop of quite weak growth over the past decade with values only 12.9% higher over the period.

The Townsville housing market has been very weak over recent years.  Over the past decade, values have fallen by a total of -26.9% and they are currently -29.8% lower than they were at their most recent peak in December 2007.  The rate of decline in the market has steadied recently with values -0.6% lower over the past three months and -5.5% lower over the past year.  Although the declines are showing signs of steadying, the annual change in values has fallen from no change a year ago.  Once this market does eventually begin to see growth again, it will likely take a long time for values to return to their previous peak levels.

The Wide Bay region of Qld which includes, Bundaberg, Maryborough, Gympie and Hervey Bay has seen values increase by just 0.3% over the past year.  Like many of the Qld regions listed, values have fallen over the past decade, down 14.2% and they are currently -14.6% lower than their May 2008 peak.  Over recent years, the market has been fairly flat however, the rate of annual growth has slowed from 1.6% a year ago.


The regions highlighted are many of the most populous regional housing markets and in most instances the rate of value growth, much like we’re seeing in major capital cities, is slowing.  The expectation is that regional markets as a whole will continue to outperform capital cities but we would expect that the rate of growth will continue to ease.  Some of the coastal markets such as Geelong and Sunshine Coast are expected to see values continue to rise while the expectation is that the major coastal markets in NSW will continue to see value growth slow.  
 
This is anticipated slowdown is due to a number of factors.  While tighter credit conditions are having the most visible impact on Sydney and Melbourne, the effect is national, with prospective borrowers facing stricter lending policies.  Satellite cities such adjacent to Sydney and Melbourne have benefitted from a ripple of demand – with migration away from NSW accelerating and housing prices in Newcastle and Lake Macquarie and Illawarra relatively expensive, the ripple of demand into Sydney’s surrounding areas may be dissipating.  Conversely, Victoria continues to see rapid pop growth from both overseas and interstate which is likely fueling a continued spillover of demand into the cities peripheral to Melbourne.  Sea change is likely being boosted by the wealth effect and strong equity from Sydney and Melbourne home owners, as values decline in these cities and credit conditions remain tight, it may be that demand for holiday homes and lifestyle properties starts to ease.

"Have you considered how much your property might earn, if you rented it through Airbnb?

Launching in 2008, Airbnb operates an online marketplace for short-term rentals. In this short time frame, the popularity of short-term rentals - finding a home away from home has grown exponentially. Now, Airbnb is home to over 4.5 million listings in 191 countries and over 65,000 cities!

We’re excited to partner with an Airbnb data & insights company, AirDNA. Together with AirDNA, we are bringing to the Australian property market the first automated valuation model for short-term rentals. 

Known as Rentalizer, the Airbnb Automated Valuation Model has been fine tuned with access to the 4.5 million listings globally on Airbnb. The model uses market characteristics, property features and comparable properties to accurately predict what a property can earn as a holiday rental.

Example Airbnb Rental Estimate

AirDNA has spent the last three years helping real estate investors around the world understand what makes the market tick in their area and how to reap the highest return on their listing in the wildly popular sharing economy.

By collecting and analyzing the last three years’ worth of booking data, AirDNA can monitor how much hosts are earning from their properties listed on Airbnb. Through this volume of rentals, they’ve seen regular apartments and houses making spectacular incomes of tens of thousands of dollars per year. 
AirDNA Rentalizer is integrated into onthehouse, so you can go and find the estimated holiday rental income by searching any property on onthehouse.com.au. You’ll find the link to Rentalizer under the Property History section on the Property Report page. Click on the button “How much could I earn” to get your Airbnb rental estimate.


According to Airdna, investors looking to buy a property to rent on Airbnb often think that purchasing a property close to home is the most sensible decision – you know the market, it’s easy to get to, you have friends that are making a little spare cash renting out their place.

Yet on the contrary, they believe that purchasing a property far from where you live forces you to make your investment a passive one, and will give you significantly higher returns as you have the whole nation to pick from to get the best returns.

If you’re unable to manage the Airbnb Rental yourself, there are a number of options available in Australia. Have a look on Google, and consider the pricing of having a short term property manager and the costs associated. You will be pleasantly surprised.

"In this week’s article we delve into how national housing markets have performed in terms of value growth in the 2017-18 financial year and how it stacks up against previous years.

The first chart highlights the change in dwelling values nationally across each financial year from 1997-98 t0 2017-18.  In the most recent financial year, dwelling values fell by -0.8% which was the largest fall in values over a financial year since 2011-12 (-3.0%).  The fall in values over the year was a significant contrast to the 10.2% increase in values over the 2016-17 financial year.

Dwelling values fell by -1.6% over the 2017-18 financial year across the combined capital cities.  This represented the largest fall since 2011-12 (-3.0%) and it was a substantial slowdown compared to the 11.1% increase in values over the 2016-17 financial year.  Last financial year was one of only four financial years over the past two decades in which capital city values have fallen.

Although combined regional market dwelling values increased by 2.2% over the 2017-18 financial year, the rate of growth was much slower than the 6.4% the previous year.  Regional dwelling value growth last year was the slowest it has been since 2012-13 when values increased by just 0.9%. Regional markets have only seen three years out of the past 20 in which values have fallen over the financial year.

Sydney dwelling values fell by -4.5% over the 2017-18 financial year which was their largest financial year fall in over 20 years.  In fact, looking at data which goes back to 1980-81 financial year, this is the weakest financial year for growth in Sydney dwelling values over that period.  The slowdown in Sydney dwelling value growth is stark when considering that a year earlier values had increased by 16.4% over the financial year.  


Dwelling values were 3.2% higher over the 2017-18 financial year in regional NSW.  Like Sydney, there has been a significant slowdown in growth over the year compared to the 11.9% increase the previous year.  In fact, the 3.2% increase was the slowest financial year growth since 2012-13.

Over the 2017-18 financial year, Melbourne dwelling values increased by 1.0%.  Although values rose for the sixth consecutive financial year, it was the slowest rate of growth out of any of those six years and well down on the 13.0% increase over the 2016-17 financial year.


Throughout regional Vic dwelling value growth actually accelerated throughout the financial year from an increase of 4.8% in 2016-17 to 5.0% in 2017-18.  The 5.0% increase in values over the year was the greatest financial year increase in values since 2010-11 when values rose by 6.1%.

Growth in Brisbane dwelling values has slowed over each of the past two financial year with an increase of 1.1% in 2017-18.  The change in values over the most recent financial year is the lowest since values fell by -3.6% over the 2011-12 financial year.  Although the rate of value growth slowed, values have increased over each of the past six financial years.


Regional Qld dwelling values rose by 0.3% over the 2017-18 financial year compared to a 3.5% rise the previous year.  Although values barely moved, values in regional Qld have now risen over each of the past six financial years.  This has occurred despite the drag from ongoing value falls in many tourist and resources linked regions of the state.

Adelaide dwelling values increased by 1.1% over the 2017-18 financial year, marking the 5th consecutive year in which values have increased. Although values increased over the year, it was the slowest rate of change for the city since values fell -0.4% in 2012-13.


Values in regional SA fell by -0.1% over the 2017-18 financial year.  This marked the third consecutive financial year in which values had fallen however, the rate of decline was the lowest over this period and up from a -0.5% fall in 2016-17.

Perth dwelling values fell by -2.1% in 2017-18 which represented a slowing of value declines from the -2.6% fall in 2016-17.  Although values have now fallen for four consecutive financial years, declines over the most recent year were the most moderate of those four years.


Dwelling values in regional WA fell for the sixth consecutive financial year in 2017-18.  Values declined by -3.3% in 2017-18 which was a steeper fall than the -2.2% the previous year but a much more moderate fall than the -9.5% in 2015-16.

Hobart dwelling values increased by 12.7% over the 2017-18 financial year which was marginally lower than the 12.8% over the previous financial year.  Dwelling values in Hobart have now increased for five consecutive financial years however, the past two years have seen the strongest growth since 2003-04.


Dwelling values in regional Tas increased for the fifth consecutive year in 2017-18, up 5.6%.   Although values increased over the year, the rate of growth was marginally lower than the 6.4% rise in values over the 2016-17 financial year.

For the fifth consecutive financial year, dwelling values in Darwin have fallen, down -7.7%.  The rate of value decline over the past financial year was much greater than the -2.6% in 2016-17 however, it was slightly lower than the -8.0% decline in 2015-16.


In regional NT dwelling values rose by 4.8% in 2017-18 which was a substantial improvement on the -7.0% fall over the previous financial year.  

The rate of value growth in dwelling values in Canberra fell from 7.8% in 2016-17 to 2.3% in 2017-18.  Although value growth slowed over the past year, Canberra dwelling values have now increased over four consecutive years following falls in three of the previous four financial years.


Across most regions of the country, dwelling value growth over the 2017-018 financial year slowed compared to the previous year.  Unlike previous downturns, the slowing of value growth was not precipitated through movements in the cash rate.  Independent increases to the cost of borrowing, particularly for investors, tighter credit conditions and a lack of real wage growth which has led to reduced affordability are some of the main drivers of the weakening housing conditions.  Looking forward to the 2018-19 financial year, the factors which contributed to the slowing growth in 2017-18 seem unlikely to be removed over the coming financial year which may result in even weaker value changes over the coming year.

Date posted: 10 July 2018",2021_04_23,10-Jul-18,N/A,How Did The Property Market Perform In The 2017-18 Financial Year?
"The latest housing credit data released by the Reserve Bank showed that the expansion of housing credit continued to slow in May 2018.  Housing credit growth is slowing as new housing finance commitments fall as do dwelling values nationally.  Given the slowing expansion of housing credit and falling demand for new finance it seems likely that falls in dwelling values will continue.

 
In May 2018, total housing credit expanded by 0.4% to be 4.8% higher over the year.  The 0.4% monthly expansion in credit was the slowest since January 2013 while the 4.8% annual rise was the slowest annual rise since February 2014.  The two charts above highlight that growth in credit is in a slowing trend both monthly and annually.

 
Monthly data shows that owner occupier credit is in a slowing trend while annual owner occupier credit growth is just beginning to shift lower.  In May 2018, owner occupier credit expanded by 0.6% over the month which was its slowest rate of monthly expansion since December 2016.  On an annual basis, owner occupier housing credit has increased by 7.9% and has now been falling for three consecutive months.

Investor housing credit was unchanged in May and as the above chart shows it has been in a clear slowing trend for some time.  The last time there was no change in investor credit on a monthly basis was December 2015 however, it has been extremely rare over the past two decades for investor credit to not be expanding.  On an annual basis, investor housing credit increased by just 2.0% in May 2018 which was the slowest rate of credit growth on record.

The above chart shows how since macroprudential policies have been in use, the monthly change in investor credit growth has been very closely correlated with the monthly change in national dwelling values.  Given that credit has become tighter and there is little sign of loosening, it seems likely that investor credit demand will remain soft and as a result value growth across the housing market will continue to be dampened.

With tight credit and fewer investors the outlook for the housing market over the coming months appears to be one whereby current conditions continue. What this means is we would expect further value falls in Sydney and Melbourne, the most expensive and investor-centric markets, and quite moderate growth in the other markets where properties are more affordable and investors are less prevalent.  The trend of softening demand from the investor segment also seems likely to persist over the coming months as accessing credit is difficult accompanied by low rental yields and limited value growth potential currently in the market.

"Preliminary auction results show 55.9 per cent of homes sell this week as fewer auctions are held across the capital cities.

The combined capital cities saw fewer homes taken to auction this week with a total of 1,400 held, down from the prior week when 1,671 auctions took place. The lower week-on-week activity returned a preliminary auction clearance of 55.9 per cent, which is higher than the previous week’s 52.6 per cent final clearance rate; although we expect as more results flow through the final auction clearance rate could be lower relative to last week. 

The weighted average has remained within the mid-50 per cent range for each of the last 8 weeks, while one year ago 65-70 per cent of homes were selling over the same period.  Although the capital city weighted average is substantially lower than a year ago, auction results are holding stronger relative to the 2010-2012 downturn in home values when the capital city clearance rate held below 50 per cent between mid-2011 and early 2012.

 

There were 632 Melbourne homes taken to auction this week, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 58.2 per cent. Last week, 791 auctions were held across the city with a lower 57.2 per cent success rate.

In Sydney, 55.1 per cent of properties sold this week, up from last week when final result saw less than half of Sydney homes successful at auction (49.7 per cent). However, there were fewer auctions held this week compared to last, with 544 homes taken to market down from the 634 auctions last week as of final figures.

Across the smaller auction markets, Canberra returned the strongest preliminary clearance rate of 64.7 per cent while only 30.8 per cent of homes sold in Perth. 

Auction results by property type


Interestingly, while the main capital city markets have seen clearances rates trend lower this year, the sub-region of Geelong has been a stand out performer, with an average clearance rate of 78.6 per cent over the year-to-date.

Parramatta saw a 0.2% change in median sales price in the last 12 month and has a median sales price of $651,340. 

The lowest number of property sales across the list was 652 in Hoppers Crossing in Victoria. 

The median sales prices of the suburbs ranged from $483,750 in Werribee, Victoria being the lowest to $689,000 in Berwick, as the highest. The lowest median sales price is in Werribee in Victoria and the highest is in Berwick in Victoria.

Eight of the top ten hottest selling suburbs were housing property markets while the other two were for unit property markets.

"When it comes to property, onthehouse.com.au latest ‘Top Ten in Ten Years’ report provides some revelations.

onthehouse.com.au (a CoreLogic business) looked at the top ten performing suburbs in each state in Australia over the last ten years, analysing both houses and units, based on the median value data in May 2018. That figure was then compared to the median value ten years beforehand (May 2008) and the results? Well…hindsight is such a wonderful thing isn’t it! 

Imagine the power of ten years’ worth of property trends in advance. 

If you had a spare $1,106,358 in your pocket in May 2008, you’d be hot-footing it to the NSW suburb of Strathfield to buy a house which would go on to achieve a 172.6% lift in value over the following decade to be Australia’s top median value of $3,015,932 in May 2018. 

However, that 172.6% lift is nothing compared to what a house in the unassuming suburb of Derrimut (in Melbourne’s Brimback), could deliver: a whopping 257.9% lift (soaring from $183,352 to $656,196): now that’s an impressive return! 

What’s behind Derrimut’s stratospheric growth? Well, ten years ago, the suburb was  brand new, and growth has since been swift - with commuter links ensuring good access to the CBD, many amenities (including recreational and educational facilities), plus plentiful green spaces and parks, it’s popular with families and young professionals. 

A new golf course with beautiful vistas is much loved, and the closeness to surrounding suburbs of Sunshine, Cairnlea and Caroline Springs is appreciated. It’s also just a short drive to Altona Beach. 

If you preferred units in 2008, and you wanted to come out with the top median value growth, you’d stay in Sydney where in Bondi Junction  the median value would grow from $507,503 to a stellar $1,287,022 - representing a 153.6% ten year lift. Biggest percentage rise for units is still in Sydney, but this time it’s Rushcutters Bay, which provided a 180% lift (that’s right!) from $286,824 to $802,981. 

Intrigued? The Top 10 performing suburbs in each state (by % growth and median value) follows, and you can download the full report with each State’s Top 10 breakdown.

ACT: 

In ACT, the top performing suburb over ten years was Mawson (where units grew 73.6%, lifting the average median value from $288,983 to $501,556).

The next best performer was houses in O’Connor, with a 70.8% ten year change in values, from $620,447 to $1,059.701 (which also represents ACT’s top median value in 2018).  Third place went to houses in Downer (60.7% growth). Looking beyond the percentages, while the top median value in May 2018 for ACT went to O’Connor’s houses, the highest median value for ACT’s units were in Canberra city ($569,598 from $426,135 ten years beforehand). 

NSW: 

The top performing NSW suburb over ten years was Sydney’s Rushcutters Bay (where units grew 180%, lifting the average median value from $286,824 to $802,981).  Second place goes to Sydney’s Warwick Farm (Liverpool), where units enjoyed a 176.6% ten year change in values, to $454,546 (from $164,318). Strathfield came in third, with median value for houses climbing 172.6% over ten years to reach $3,015,932 (from $1,106,358). This also represented the top median value for NSW houses. NSW’s top median value units are found in Sydney’s Bondi Junction ($1,287,022 from $507,503 ten years beforehand). 

NT: 

With relatively passive ten year growth compared to larger markets, a minimal number of suburbs met the criteria for analysis. But of those that did, the top performing NT suburb over ten years was Gillen in Alice Springs (where houses grew 43%, lifting the average median value from $319,154 to $456,233).  Durack’s houses came second, with a 21.9% ten year change in values, to $612,756 (from $420,597). This also represented the top median value for NT houses. Units in Larrakeyah came in third, with median value of $477,736 climbing 18.6% over ten years, and also representing NT’s top median value units. 

QLD:

All of Queensland’s top 10 performing suburbs for houses were in the Brisbane main capital city region, but just one of the capital suburbs made the top 10 list for units, which was completely dominated by The Gold Coast.  The top QLD performer over the last decade was Underwood in Brisbane’s Logan, where houses grew 65.6% in median value to reach $601,345 (from $363,048). Houses in Brisbane’s Ashgrove came second with 53.4% in median value to reach $1,019,808 (from $664,792).  The top median value for QLD’s houses is in Hawthorne with a median value of $1,274,810. The top median value for QLD’s units is in The Gold Coast’s Paradise Point, where the median value grew 44% to reach $576,240 (from $400,142 ten years beforehand). 

SA:

In South Australia, houses were the best performer - with Grange topping the list at 49.4% growth in median value to reach $732,554 (up from $490,309). This is also the top median value for houses. For units, the top performer was Norwood, with 35% growth to reach $517,731 (from $383,483) - also the top median value for units.  

VIC: 

In a result that won’t surprise anyone, all of Victoria’s top house and unit suburbs were in the Melbourne Capital City region, where Derrimut houses topped the list with the highest growth over ten years (257.9% - Australia’s highest growth rate). The top median value for houses is at Ashburton in Boroonda where values grew 153.9% to reach $1,905,114. Units in Altona North came in at second place with 164% growth to reach a median value of $655,491. 

WA:

Houses in Perth’s suburb of Wattle Grove recorded the highest growth of 89.7% to reach a median value of $506,235. The aptly named suburb of ‘Success’ (also in the capital city) reached second place with 83.7% to achieve a median value of $514,263. But top median value for houses goes to Darch in Wanneroo at $574,909 (resulting from 68.3% growth). The top performing suburb for units was West Leederville, with 48% growth resulting in a May 2018 median value of $470,316. The top median value for WA units can be found in South Perth ($575,287).

"CoreLogic Interest rate comments with Tim Lawless, head of research: 

Economic conditions remain reasonably stable, housing market growth continues to slow, household debt is at record highs, and inflation remains around the lower end of the RBA target range. With this scenario as a backdrop, the hold decision today from the RBA was widely anticipated.  It is looking increasingly as if the cash rate will hold at record lows throughout 2019; this is the view of financial markets where the ASX cash rate yield curve indicates the cash rate will remain on hold until at least November 2019. 

However, focus is now moving to mortgage rates, where we are increasingly seeing upwards pressure from overseas funding costs. Already, smaller banks and non-banks, who are generally more exposed to wholesale debt costs, are pushing interest rates higher for select mortgage products. 

Larger banks, who are more reliant on domestic deposits to fund their home loans, have less exposure to higher funding costs. However it is likely margin pressures are becoming evident across the big end of town as well.  Despite these early signs of some upwards pressure on mortgage rates, average variable rates remain almost 120 basis points below their decade average of 6.4%. Borrowers, particularly owner occupiers with principal and interest loans, should continue to expect a low mortgage rate over the medium term

"Dwelling values are falling and fewer transactions are occurring across the housing market which should create alarms for market participants such as agent, lenders, state governments and brokers that are reliant on housing turnover.

Despite dwelling values having only recently started to fall, the number of settled transactions in the housing market has been trending lower since peaking in 2015.  It is important to note that off-the-plan sales are not counted until completion and they are counted at their contract date.  What this means is that there will be some upwards revision to recent sales volumes given the high volume of units currently under construction.

Nationally, there were 465,788 settled house and unit sales over the 12 months to May 2018.  The annual number of settled sales was -7.7% lower over the year.  The monthly data shown in the chart points to a declining trend in transactions with settled sales now sitting lower than the decade average.

Over the 12 months to May 2018 there were 84,699 settled house and unit sales in Sydney.  Although the monthly data points to a slight rebound in transactions recently, likely the result of a surge in first home buyers since July last year.  Annual sales were -13.5% lower over the past 12 months.  House sales were -11.4% lower over the year and unit sales were -16.0% lower.  Monthly sales volumes have consistently been lower than the 10 year average since May 2017.  While there is likely to be some revision as unsettled sales flow through, it remains likely that ultimately sales volumes are lower over the year.

Settled sales transactions have been trending lower for a number of years in Melbourne which is partly to do with high volumes of units under construction but also strong demand and relatively low supply of housing for sale.  With values now falling, the 83,444 settled sales over the past year was -12.9% lower than the previous year.  House sales are 13.2% lower and unit sales are down -12.4%. Like Sydney, it seems unlikely that once all off-the-plan properties are completed and settled that transaction volumes will be higher than a year ago.

Over the 12 months to May 2018 there were 48,050 settled house and unit sales in Brisbane.  On an annual basis, transaction volumes across the city were -12.1% lower over the year.  House sales have fallen by -8.3% over the year while unit sales have recorded a much greater fall of -19.8%.  As the chart shows, monthly sales volumes have been trending lower for a number of years and are now slightly lower than the decade average.  Volumes, particularly for units, are likely to see some moderate revision over the coming years but are likely to remain lower than they were a year ago.

Over the past 12 months there were 27,705 settled sales in Adelaide which was 2.5% more sales than over the same period in 2017.  Annual house sales were 0.5% higher over the year while unit sales recorded a much greater 85% increase.  Adelaide is one of only two capital cities in which annual sales were higher over the year and it is also one of the few cities in which monthly transaction volumes are currently above the decade average.

Perth’s housing market has been in a downturn since 2014 however, there are some early signs that transaction are lifting, albeit for a very low base.  Over the past 12 months there were 30,393 settled sales which was 1.4% higher than the previous year with house sales 1.0% higher and unit sales 3.4% higher.  As the housing market slowly shows signs of improvement sales volumes may continue to climb.

Although dwelling values in Hobart are increasing at a much faster pace in Hobart than any other capital city, transaction volumes are falling.  This is largely due to strong demand and little supply of stock available for sale (advertised listings are currently around record lows across Hobart).  Over the past 12 months there was 4,915 dwelling transactions in Hobart which was -7.4% fewer than the previous year with house sales down -7.3% and unit sales -7.9% lower.  Monthly sales are currently only marginally higher than the decade average.

Darwin has recorded 2,018 dwelling sales over the past 12 months which was -5.8% fewer than the previous year with house sales -7.7% lower and unit sales down -2.1%.  Like Perth, Darwin has been in a downturn for a number of years but has seen an increase in transactions over recent months with last month’s sales close to the decade average.

Monthly transaction in Canberra are sitting right on their decade average however, the chart shows that sales have been trending lower for over a year.  Over the past 12 months, there were 8,310 settled sales which was -10.0% lower than the previous year with house sales down -3.0% and unit sales -16.5% lower.  With value growth slowing it is reasonable to expect fewer sales over the short-term.

With dwelling values now falling and tighter credit conditions it is reasonable to anticipate that transaction volumes will continue to trend lower.  For sellers this means they will need to be realistic about their price expectations as buyers become more empowered.  As a result sellers will need to ensure their marketing strategy is finely tuned and set appropriate prices in order to achieve a sale.  Fewer sales means less turnover, which in-turn means less commission and less stamp duty revenue for state governments.

"The final week of June returns a 56.7 per cent preliminary auction clearance rate with fewer homes taken to market week-on-week.

The last week of June saw fewer homes taken to auction, with 1,669 auctions held across the combined capital cities, down from the 1,849 held over the week prior. The lower week-on-week volumes returned a slightly improved preliminary clearance rate of 56.7 per cent, contributing to a year-to-date average of 60.5 per cent for the first six months of 2018 based on preliminary figures. A very different result to the first half of 2017, when an average of 72.5 per cent of homes were selling over the corresponding period.  The 2018 auction market so far has demonstrated the weakening property market, with the success rate of auctions continuing to fall through the first half of the year; returning the lowest weekly clearance rates seen since 2012 as property values decline in turn.

The unit market returned a preliminary clearance rate above 60 per cent this week, taking the average over the first six months of 2018 to 65.1 per cent; maintaining strength relative to the detached house market where an average of 59.5 per cent of houses cleared over the year-to-date, albeit houses account for a significantly higher proportion of overall activity.

There were 795 Melbourne homes taken to auction this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 60.3 per cent, increasing only slightly on last week’s final clearance rate of 59.9 per cent when a higher 941 auctions were held. 

Sydney’s preliminary clearance rate improved this week, with 56.4 per cent of auctions successful across a relatively steady volume of auctions week-on-week, with 631 held. Last week a similar 641 auctions took place returning a final auction clearance rate of 50.1 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Canberra was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with 65.6 per cent of auctions successful, while only 25 per cent of auctions cleared across Perth.

"The combined capital cities are expected to see a lower volume of auctions this week with CoreLogic currently tracking 1,557 auctions, down from 1,849 last week. 

Melbourne is the busiest city for auctions again this week, with 735 auctions being tracked so far, down from 941 last week. Sydney has 606 auctions scheduled this week, down from 641 last week. 

Perth is expecting to see a slight increase in auction volumes this week, with 33 auctions scheduled, up from 29 last week, while volumes are down across the remaining cities.

Over the same week last year, 2,001 homes went under the hammer across the combined capital cities, returning a clearance rate of 67.3 per cent. 

Three of the four busiest suburbs for auctions are in Melbourne this week. Craigieburn tops the list with 22 homes scheduled for auction, followed by Epping (13) and Preston (12). Randwick in Sydney also features in the top 4 suburbs this week with 13 homes set to go under the hammer.

Summary of last week's results


Last week, a total of 1,849 auctions were held across the combined capital cities, returning a final clearance rate of 55.5 per cent, increasing from the previous week when 52.4 per cent of the 2,002 auctions held were successful, the lowest clearance rate seen since late 2012. This time last year, the clearance rate was 66.5 per cent across 2,355 auctions.


Melbourne’s final clearance rate was recorded at 59.9 per cent this week across 941 auctions increasing from 56.2 per cent across 992 auctions over the previous week. One year ago, 1,047 auctions were held across the city and a clearance rate of 70.7 per cent was recorded.

Sydney’s final auction clearance rate was recorded at 50.1 per cent across 641 auctions last week, increasing slightly from 49.4 per cent across 708 auctions over the previous week. Over the same week last year, 939 homes went to auction and a clearance rate of 68.2 per cent was recorded.

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates improved everywhere except Tasmania, however only 3 auctions were held there over the week.

Of the non-capital city auction markets, Geelong returned the highest final clearance rate, with a success rate of 71.4 per cent across 26 auctions.

"The latest private sector credit data from the Reserve Bank (RBA) shows that the expansion of housing credit continues to slow with both owner occupier and investor credit growth tracking lower in April.

The RBA recently released private sector credit figures for April 2018 and the data reiterates the ongoing slowing of demand for housing credit. Over the month, housing credit expanded by 0.4% which, when rounded, was the slowest monthly expansion in housing credit since June 2013. Over the past 12 months, housing credit has increased by 6.0% which is its slowest annual increase since March 2014. The first two charts show how in 2008 and 2013, when dwelling values were falling, the expansion of credit also slowed.

Monthly Change in Total Housing Credit

Housing credit expansion is slowing for both owner occupiers and investors. Over the month, owner occupier credit increased by 0.6% while investor credit expanded by just 0.1%. Over the month, owner occupier credit expanded at its slowest monthly rate since December 2016 and investor credit expanded at its slowest pace since March 2016. In the recent housing market downturns, it has typically been investor credit growth that has slowed much more than owner occupier. Given that investors have been a substantial driver of housing demand over recent years, it is reasonable to expect that investor credit growth will slow further from here as values in the most investor-centric markets (Sydney and Melbourne) continue to fall.

On an annual basis, it is clear that the slowdown in investor credit growth is entrenched, while owner occupier housing credit has also slowed, but is holding firmer. Owner occupier credit expanded by 8.0% over the past year, its slowest annual expansion since January 2018 while investor credit grew by just 2.3% which is its slowest rate of annual growth since September 2016.

As at the end of April 2018 there was $2.827 trillion in credit outstanding to Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), Of this $2.827 trillion, $1.755 trillion or 62.1% was to residential housing with a further 32.5% to business and 5.4% for other personal credit. Although it has only occurred over the past two months, after trending higher for many years, the share of total credit that was for housing has edged lower. In previous housing market downturns, the share of outstanding credit to housing has fallen. Given this, the expectation is that the share of total credit for housing will continue to decline over the coming months as values continue to fall.

Share of Total Outstanding Credit to Australian ADIs
by Type

Source: CoreLogic, RBA

The slowdown in housing credit growth is being driven by a range different factors. Firstly, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) introduced a 10% speed limit on investor credit in December 2014 which has resulted in a slowing of investor credit growth. Although APRA have announced that this cap will be removed shortly it is unlikely that investor credit growth will accelerate in a meaningful way. Secondly, loan serviceability is now being calculated across the board based on an interest rate of at least 7% which has made accessing credit for some more difficult. APRA has also implemented a cap on interest-only lending of 30% of all new mortgages, this has led to a substantial drop in demand for this product which was largely used for investors. Finally, lenders are now typically charging premiums of 60 basis points on interest rates for investors compared to owner occupiers with premiums typically in excess of 100 basis points for investors with interest-only loans.

Although the 10% speed limit is set to be lifted from July 1st, the likelihood of a rebound in housing credit remain low. The 30% cap on interest-only lending has a much more broad based dampening effect on investor activity. Add to this the fact that APRA is now focusing more on minimising debt to income ratios higher than 6 and maintaining a focus on keeping low deposit lending to a minimum and banks are stepping up their scrutiny on borrower expenses and incomes. The net effect is likely to be further tightness in housing credit which will continue to constrict housing market activity and reduce prospects for price appreciation.

"According to the CoreLogic Home Value Index, national dwelling values were -1.1% lower than their peak in May 2018. The declines were primarily driven by recent weakness in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets however, a number of other cities also have values which remain below their peak. This week’s blog presents the recent periods in which dwelling values have fallen across each capital city and how long values have taken following these falls for values to eclipse their previous peak.

Peak to Trough Declines
Sydney

There has been a number of periods of decline in Sydney over the past 38 years with the greatest fall recorded between 1988-91 when values fell by -11.6% in 28 months. Following that period of decline it took 65 months (until 1994) for values to eclipse their previous peak. Other downturns have typically resulted in more moderate falls in values and a much quicker recovery to the previous peak.

Over recent years, Melbourne has seen six periods of sustained downturn in dwelling values, the largest of which was between 2008 and 2009 in which values fell by -9.4% in 12 months. The longest downturn was between 1989 and 1992 in which values fell -8.3% over three years. This downturn was also the one which resulted in the longest period for values returning to their previous peak with values remaining below their peak for 91 months between 1989 and 1997.

Although Brisbane dwelling values currently sit at a peak, there have been four recent periods of decline, the largest of which between 2010 and 2012 saw values fall by -10.6% from their peak. This same downturn resulted in the longest period in which values were below their peak, stretching for 61 months between 2010 and 2015.

Over recent years, there have been three sustained downturns in values across Adelaide, the greatest of which saw values fall by -8.0% over 28 months between 2010 and 2012.  Although values fell by -8.0% in 28 months during this downturn, they remained below their previous peak for 57 months between 2010 and 2015.

Over recent years Perth has experienced a number of downturns in the housing market. The downturn between 2008 and 2009, although short-lived, resulted in the greatest overall fall in values with a decline of 11.0% in 13 months. The current downturn has seen values fall by -10.8% from their peak which occurred in 2014. Based on the data it will likely take some time for values return to their 2014 peak.

Hobart dwelling values are currently rising at a much faster pace than any other capital city in the country. Nevertheless, Hobart has seen a number of periods over recent years in which values have declined. The period between 2010 and 2012 saw the largest of these declines with values falling by -10.5% over 27 months. Following this 27 month decline in values, values took until 2016, 74 months after the peak to return to this peak.

The historic data for Darwin is nowhere near as long as it is for other capital cities, nevertheless, over the period there has been two periods of sustained downturns in values. The current downturn has seen values in Darwin fall from their peak by -22.3% over 45 months. Values have increased over the past two months however, they remain a long way (-21.3%) from their previous peak and will take some time to get back to those levels of 47 months ago.

Canberra has witnessed a number of periods in which dwelling values have fallen over recent years. The greatest value declines from the market peak to trough occurred over 35 months between 1994 and 1996 in which values fell by -14.7%. While the declines were greatest between 1994 and 1996, the downturn in which values took longest to return to peak occurred between 2010 and 2016. During this period, values fell by -7.2 from the peak over 51 months and took a total of 75 months to return to eclipse the previous peak.

A noticeable trend across most downturns in most cities is that the period in which values decline is generally a lot longer than the period from the maximum decline to the return to the previous peak. What this means is that the rebound following the decline is typically faster than the decline. Of course there are some notable exceptions to this namely Sydney between 1988 and 1994, Melbourne between 1989 and 1997, Brisbane 2010 to 2015, Perth 1994 to 1997, Hobart 2010 to 2016 and Canberra 2003 to 2006.

Periods of decline in the housing market are not uniform and as such it is difficult to predict exactly how long values will fall for and then how long a recovery will take. What we do know is that monetary and fiscal policy can impact on the market stopping declines and leading to a rebound, and vice versa. For example in 2008 as dwelling values were falling, the cash rate was cut substantially by the RBA and the federal government introduced the first home buyers grant boost which quickly reversed the declines. In 2010, value falls were bought on by the removal of first home buyer stimulus and higher interest rates, these falls were reversed by cutting interest rates. More recently in 2015-16 values began falling on the back of tighter lending policies, particularly to investors, yet these declines were reversed with two 25 basis point cuts to interest rates accompanied by an improvement in lender appetite for investor loans.

Commentary from the RBA at the moment seems to intimate that there is little prospect of a cut to the cash rate and they do seem unperturbed to-date with the declines in Sydney and Melbourne dwelling values. Given this, we expect values to continue to fall over the short-term but movements such as a change in mortgage rates or easing of macroprudential controls could reverse things. Of course, values could also continue to fall for some time and the market could go through a natural correction with buyers returning to the market at the point in which they consider it to be fair value. Only time will tell how this plays out.

"The CoreLogic hedonic decile series splits the market into 10 even segments based on the value of properties providing a more detailed view on how dwelling values are tracking across each city. This week, we compare growth across the most affordable 10% of properties (1st decile) and the most expensive 10% (10th decile).

Over the past 12 months, dwelling values have fallen by -0.4% nationally. While most people are aware of differing value changes city-to-city within a geography, properties within different value bands can also see quite different changes in values. While national dwelling values are -0.4% lower over the past year, the most affordable 10% of properties have seen values rise 1.8% while the most expensive 10% of properties have recorded a fall of -5.0%.

Annual Change in Values
Combined Capital Cities


Across the combined capital cities, dwelling values have fallen -1.1% over the past 12 months. Looking at the 1st decile, values have increased by 1.3% over the past year while across the 10th decile values have fallen by -5.7%. What is noticeable from the chart is that when values have gone into a downturn over recent years, declines across the most affordable properties have been significantly smaller than the declines across the most expensive properties. The opposite is generally the case during the growth phase, where the most expensive properties have generally outperformed the broader market.

Combined regional market values have increased by 2.2% over the past year with the most affordable properties recording growth of 4.9% and the most expensive recording a rise of 2.1%. The most affordable 10% of properties have consistently outperformed growth across the median and the 10th decile over recent years. In fact over the 20 year period shown the most affordable 10% of properties have never recorded an annual decline in values.

Annual Change in Values
Combined Regional Markets


Sydney has seen the largest declines of all capital cities over the past year with values -4.2% lower. Across the 1st decile, values are 1.0% higher while the 10th decile has recorded value falls of -7.3%. Over recent downturns, the declines across the most expensive properties have been much greater than those across the most affordable. For example in the 2008 downturn, the 1st decile recorded peak to trough falls of -2.1% while the 10th decile saw values fall -14.3%. Similarly in the 2010-12 correction, the 1st decile saw values continue to rise while the 10th decile saw values fall -9.9%. The surge in first home buyers taking advantage of stamp duty concession is likely helping to keep a floor under housing demand across the more affordable valuation bands which is supporting the stronger conditions across the lower valued end of the market.

Annual Change in Values
Sydney


Over the past year, Melbourne dwelling values have increased by 2.2% with the 1st decile recording an increase of 10.3% while the 10th decile has seen value fall -3.5%. Like Sydney in recant downturns the most expensive properties have fallen much more than the most affordable. During the 2008 downturn, values across the 10th decile fell -17.5% while values in the 1st decile continued to grow. During the 2010-12 downturn, the 1st decile recorded peak to trough falls of -6.0% compared to a -12.7% decline across the 10th decile. Similar to Sydney, first home buyers have become more active since July last year, likely supporting stronger housing market conditions at the more affordable price points.Over the long-term, values of the most affordable properties in Brisbane have increased at a much faster pace than the median and the most expensive 10%. Over the past year, dwelling values are 0.9% higher however, the 1st decile has recorded an increase of 1.1% compared to a 0.5% increase across the 10th decile. Like Sydney and Melbourne, during the 2008 downturn, the 1st decile recorded a more moderate decline (-6.6%) than the 10th decile (-11.5%). Where Brisbane differs is during the 2010-12 downturn, the 10th decile actually reordered a slightly more moderate fall (-11.9%) than the 1st decile (-12.6%).

Although Adelaide values are still rising, the 10th decile has actually recorded a decline in values over the past year while 1st decile values have continued to rise. Over the past 12 months, 1st decile values have increased by 1.1% while 10th decile values have fallen by -1.1%. Like most other capital cities, in recent downturns the 10th decile has recorded much larger value falls than the 1st decile. During the 2008 downturn values fell 1.6% across the 1st decile compared to -6.9% across the 10th and in the 2010-12 downturn 1st decile values fell -5.9% compared to a -12.0% fall across the 10th decile.

Over recent years, values across the 10th decile have typically underperformed in terms of growth compared to the median and compared to the most affordable properties. The performance has changed somewhat over the past 12 months with the 1st decile recording a fall in values of -2.8% while the 10th decile recorded an increase in values of 2.1%. The Perth housing market has been consistently weak over recent years, over the past decade, values have fallen by -4.9% with the 1st decile seeing values increasing 12.4% while to 10th decile has seen values fall -14.5%.

Hobart dwelling values are currently rising faster than any other capital city in the country however, values across the 1st decile are rising at a more rapid pace than those across the 10th decile. Over the past 12 months 1st decile values have increased by 18.4% while 10th decile values have increase by a substantial, but much more moderate rate of 9.4%. Over the past decade, 1st decile values in Hobart have risen by 53.3% while 10th decile values are up by less than half of that at 21.3%.

Since their peak in May 2014, dwelling values in Darwin have fallen by -21.3%. Over the past 12 months, values across Darwin’s first decile have fallen by -5.3% compared to a decline of more than double that (13.5%) across the 10th decile. The chart highlights how outside of a short period in 2016, the 1st decile has consistently recorded stronger value growth than the median and the 10th decile. Compared to their historic peak, 1st decile values are -24.9% lower whereas 10th decile values are -35.0% lower.

Historically, the 1st decile properties in Canberra have recorded much greater increases in values than the 10th decile. Over the past year, the long-term trend has held true with 1st decile values 2.1% higher and 10th decile values increasing by 2.0%. Throughout the recent housing market downturns, the 10th decile has typically experienced greater value declines than the 1st decile. In the 2008 downturn, 1st decile values fell by -2.3% compared to an -8.0% decline across 10th decile values. Similarly in the 2010-12 downturn, falls across the 1st decile were fairly moderate (-2.8%) compared to much greater falls across the 10th decile (-14.5%).

The data overwhelmingly shows that over the long-term values at the more affordable end of the housing market have increased at a faster pace than the most expensive properties. Furthermore, the data also highlights that when there is a housing market downturn lower-valued properties typically experience much more moderate declines than the higher valued housing stock. This is most likely due to the fact that there is a dearth of really affordable and really expensive housing stock however, affordable housing is a necessity whereas expensive housing isn’t so when times get tough, demand for high-valued housing proves fickle and subsequently the declines tend to be much greater. With values now falling in Sydney and Melbourne, much greater value falls are already being experienced at the top-end of the market and this trend is expected to continue as values continue to recede.

"The preliminary clearance rate increased to 58.7 per cent this week, after last week saw the final clearance rate revise down to just 52.4 per cent. Auction volumes were lower over the week with 1,842 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, down from 2,002 last week. While the preliminary clearance rate tends to revise lower over the week as the remaining results are captured, the final clearance rate should still show an improvement week-on-week.


Melbourne was host to 946 auctions over the week, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 62.3 per cent, compared to last week when 56.2 per cent of the 992 auctions were successful. Over the same week last year, there were 1,047 auctions held in Melbourne, returning a clearance rate of 70.7 per cent. 


There were 635 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 55.3 per cent. In comparison, last week there were 708 auctions held and a final clearance rate of 49.4 per cent was recorded, while this time last year, 68.2 per cent of the 939 auctions held were successful.

Across the smaller auction markets, Brisbane was the busiest city with 112 homes going under the hammer, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 43.7 per cent.

"As the housing market transitions from one in which values are growing to one where values are declining, in this week’s blog we take a look at the suburbs that have experienced the greatest change in listings over the year.

With dwelling values now falling, led by a rapid slowdown in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets, these two cities have also experienced a lift in listings.  In most other cities the number of properties for sale has been relatively steady while Hobart has experienced a substantial fall in stock for sale over the past year.

In this week’s Pulse we look at the suburbs with the greatest annual change in listings based on properties advertised for sale over the 12 months to May 2017 and 12 months to May 2018.  We have only looked at suburbs with at least 50 listings in each period.

The major regional town of Katherine in the NT has experienced the greatest increase in properties listed for sale over the year (97.8%).  The mining town of Clermont in Qld has seen the second largest increase with listings 80.3% higher.

Suburbs with the greatest 12 month change in the
number of properties listed for sale
 

The first table shows the top 5 for each state and territory, despite listings trending lower in regional markets, suburbs located outside of the capital cities dominate the list making up 25 of the 40 suburbs listed.  Despite the mining downturn having been in place for a number of years the list of suburbs in Qld and SA is dominated by mining regions. Suggesting, suggesting owners may be more willing to sell as conditions level out or more distressed assets are hitting the market.  NSW shows a dominance of Sydney suburbs while in Vic the list completely consists of regional suburbs, as does the WA list.  Only one of the suburbs listed for Tas has more properties advertised for sale than they had a year ago which highlights the tightness of stock for sale across the state.  In NT, regional areas dominate the list. 

Suburbs with the greatest 12 month fall in the
number of properties listed for sale
 


Although regional areas are typically seeing larger declines in stock for sale than capital cities, capital cities account for 25 of the 40 suburbs listed in which property listings have fallen the most over the year.  Although this is the case, Tallwoods Village in regional NSW has seen the greatest fall in listings over the year, down -61.3%.

In NSW, regional areas have typically seen the greatest fall in listings.  Given that listings are substantially higher than they were a year ago this is unsurprising.  For Vic, Hadfield is the only capital city suburb listed with regional areas dominant.  This is reflective of the much stronger value growth being experienced in regional markets.  In all other states and territories except Tas the capital city markets dominate the list.  In Tas, the volume of listings has tightened throughout the state.  

Overall as the housing market is slowing, the number of properties for sale is climbing in Sydney and Melbourne, providing for less urgency amongst buyers and more time to negotiate.  As stock levels rise, buyers become more empowered and vendors may need to rethink their pricing expectations and marketing strategies.  Elsewhere stock levels are tightening and we would expect these trends to continue.

"The top 5 busiest suburbs for auctions this week are all in Victoria; not surprising given Melbourne is set to be the busiest auction market. Topping the list with 17 homes scheduled for auction is Reservoir, following closely is Craigieburn with 16, Glen Waverley and Richmond each to host 13 and South Yarra with 12.

Upcoming Auctions

Auction activity is set to rise across the combined capital cities this week, with the number of homes scheduled for auction more than doubling over the week after last week’s Queens’s birthday long weekend slowdown. CoreLogic is currently tracking 1,886 capital city auctions this week, rising on last week when final figures showed 904 auctions held.

Auctions This Week

Melbourne is set to be the busiest auction market this week, with a total of 932 homes scheduled for auction, increasing on last week when a very subdued 275 homes were taken to auction.

Volumes are also set to increase across Australia’s second largest auction market Sydney, with a total of 680 homes scheduled to go under the hammer this week, up on the 415 auctions held last week.

Across the smaller markets, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth are all expected to see a considerable increase in activity this week, while volumes across Brisbane are set to remain relatively steady, with Tasmania the only auction market set to see a fall in auction volumes over the week.

Summary of Last Week's Results
Capital City Auction Statistics (Final)


Last week saw the combined capital city auction market slowdown ahead of the Queen’s birthday public holiday, with only 904 homes taken to auction last week. The lower volumes did little to improve clearances rates last week with the weighted average declining further returning a 53.8 per cent final auction clearance rate; the fifth consecutive week of falls across the combined markets. A very difference result to what was seen one year ago, when a much higher 67.8 per cent of homes cleared at auction over the same week (1,279 auctions).

Weekly Clearance Rate, Combined Capital Cities


Sydney was the busiest auction market last week, outperforming Melbourne in terms of clearance rate and number of auctions. There were 415 Sydney homes taken to auction last week returning a 56 per cent success rate, increasing on the week prior when the final clearance rate dropped to 47.1 per cent; albeit volumes were considerably higher across the city.

The public holiday long weekend resulted in very low activity across Melbourne last week, with a very modest 275 homes taken to market returning a 54.9 per cent final clearance rate, decreasing significantly on the week prior when 1,079 auctions were held and 59.8 per cent cleared.

Brisbane, Perth and Tasmania all saw an improvement in clearance rates week-on-week, while Adelaide and Canberra’s final clearance rate fell.

Geelong was the best performing non-capital city region last week, with a clearance rate of 63.6 per cent across 21 auctions.

"Auction activity is expected to be quite subdued across the capital cities this week, with a total of 814 homes scheduled for auction ahead of the Queen’s Birthday Public holiday this coming Monday; which is resulting in a long weekend for most of the states and territories

Melbourne will see the most significant drop in activity this week, with volumes down 77.5 per cent on last week’s final figures. There are 243 homes scheduled for auction across the city this week, down on last week’s final of 1,079 auctions held.

Sydney is set to be the busiest auction market this week, despite the public holiday slowdown, volumes are expected to fall to a lesser degree, with a total of 377 properties scheduled to go under the hammer, down from the 837 held last week at final results.

Brisbane and Perth are the only auction markets that will not have a public holiday, however the number of auctions scheduled for Brisbane are down on last week, with Perth being the only market to see a rise in volumes this week.

Craigieburn in Victoria is set to be the busiest suburb for auctions this week, with 9 scheduled, albeit activity is substantially lower across the individual suburbs.  Following with 8 scheduled auctions is Marrickville in NSW and Glen Waverley with 7 homes scheduled for auction.

Summary of last week's results

Last week, the combined capital city final auction clearance rate softened further, with only 54.1 per cent of homes selling; marking the 4th consecutive week where the weighted average has declined.   There were 2,281 homes taken to auction across the capitals last week, remaining relatively steady on the week prior’s 2,297 auctions held when a higher 56.2 per cent cleared.  Both volumes and clearance rates have continued to track lower each week over the last 4 week’s compared to the equivalent period last year.

Melbourne returned a success rate of 59.8 per cent last week across 1,079 auctions, increasing slightly on the 59.0 per cent over the week prior when 1,132 auctions were held; a relatively steady week-on-week result across the city. 

In Sydney, a total of 837 homes were taken to auction last week with less than half of these reportedly selling.  A final auction clearance rate of 47.1 per cent was recorded across the city, the lowest seen since early 2016 when activity was less comparable over the January low season, prior to that, clearance rates were last this low throughout the late 2010-2012 market downturn. 

Adelaide and Brisbane both saw an improvement in clearance rates week-on-week, while Canberra and Perth’s final clearance rate fell.

Across the non-capital city regions, the highest clearance rate was recorded across the Geelong region (62.9 per cent).

As usual, Melbourne and Sydney are the two busiest capital city auction markets this week, with 990 and 791 homes scheduled to go to auction; down from last week’s final result which saw 1,132 and 814 auctions held across the cities respectively.

Auction activity is expected to be lower week-on week across Brisbane, Perth and Tasmania, while Adelaide and Canberra are expected to be the only capital cities this week to see.


This week, the busiest suburb for auctions is Reservoir in Victoria, with 20 homes set to go under the hammer, following closely with 17 auctions scheduled each is Port Macquarie in NSW and Bentleigh East in Victoria.

Summary of last week's results


The combined capital city final auction clearance rate fell to 56.2 per cent last week; the third consecutive week where the combined weighted average has progressively declined. There were 2,297 homes taken to market which was only slightly higher than the week prior when 2,100 auctions were held and 56.8 per cent cleared. The last time clearance rates were tracking at a similar level was in early 2013 when volumes were less comparable over what was the January low period (667). 


There were 1,132 Melbourne homes taken to market last week, increasing on the 1,033 over the week prior. The higher volumes saw the final clearance rate drop below 60 per cent, with 59 per cent of auctions successful down on the 62 per cent the previous week.

In Sydney, both auction volumes and the final clearance rate increased last week, with 814 auctions held returning a final auction clearance rate of 56.1 per cent, which was higher than the 54 per cent over the previous week when 672 auctions were held across the city.

Adelaide, Canberra and Perth all saw a week-on-week improvement in clearance rates, while Brisbane and Tasmania’s clearance rate fell.

Across the non-capital city regions, the highest clearance rate was recorded across the Hunter region, with 72.4 per cent of the 54 auctions successful.

"Last week we investigated how close to the city you could find suburbs where the median house value was under $500,000, this week the report looks at the results for units.  Note that distances quoted are measured in a straight line and the distances by road may be much different.

The results highlight that housing options under $500,000 are available much closer to the CBD for units compared with houses. This likely also goes some way to explaining why in Sydney and Melbourne, where house values are falling, the more affordable unit market is holding up better.

Suburbs closest to a capital city GPO with a
median unit value of less than $500,000

Sydney

Lakemba is the suburb closest to the city centre with a median unit value below $500,000. Located just over 12km from the city centre, the median value is $435,314.  Compared to other capital cities, unit values below $500,000 are typically much further away from the city centre.

Melbourne

The Melbourne CBD has a median unit value below $500,000 and most of the suburbs surrounding the CBD also offer units which are typically valued below $500,000.  Compare this to the detached housing market where the suburb closest to the city with a median below $500,000 was 16km away.

Brisbane

Most suburbs in Greater Brisbane have a median unit value below $500,000.  Even within the CBD and surrounds median unit values generally sit below $500,000 offering a much more affordable alternative, particularly in the inner city to houses.

Adelaide

Units are much more affordable than houses throughout the city.  In fact, throughout the whole city there are only five suburbs in which median unit values are in excess of $500,000.

Perth

While most of the suburbs surrounding Perth’s CBD have a median unit value below $500,000 there remains many suburbs with a median value of more than $500,000.  These suburbs are typically along the coast or along the Swan River in some of the more exclusive enclaves.

Hobart

With a citywide median unit value well below $500,000 most of the suburbs across Hobart have a median value below $500,000.  In fact, across the whole city only 3 suburbs have a median unit value of more than $500,000.

Darwin

Only one suburb in all of Greater Darwin has a median unit value of more than $500,000.  As a result, the supply of relatively affordable unit stock is significant, particularly when compared to houses below $500,000.

Canberra

While there was only 1 suburb with a median house value below $500,000 there are substantially more suburbs with a median unit value below $500,000. Many of these suburbs are also quite close to the city centre resulting in a cheaper and more viable housing alternative in these areas.

"This week marks 12 months since the combined capital city auction market last recorded a clearance rate above 70 per cent, with selling conditions progressively weakening over the year as property values fall resulting in fewer homes selling at auction. There were 2,287 homes taken to market this week across the capital cities, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 59.7 per cent, after last week saw the final clearance rate fall to the lowest recorded since late 2013, with 56.8 per cent of properties selling (2,100 auctions). While preliminary results show improvement this week across the slightly higher volume of auctions the revisionary final clearance rate is likely to show less of an improvement.


Looking at results across the individual property types, the unit market has continued to outperform the house market with 64.9 per cent of units selling this week, while only 57.6 per cent of houses sold. While the proportion of units going to market is generally considerably lower, looking at the trend over time, the weakening selling rate is more evident across the larger segment of the market with 18.2 per cent more houses selling one year ago, compared to an 11.7 per cent difference across the unit segment. 

Auction results by property type


Melbourne recorded a preliminary clearance rate of 60.9 per cent this week across 1,132 auctions, falling on last week’s final clearance rate of 62 per cent when 1,033 auctions where held and significantly lower than the 74.2 per cent last year when volumes were also higher (1,366). It is likely Melbourne’s final clearance rate this week will weaken further and fall below 60 per cent as results are collected.


Volumes increased across Sydney this week, with 808 auctions held across the city. The higher volumes returned a 62.7 per cent preliminary clearance rate, increasing on last week when the final clearance rate dropped to 54 per cent; the lowest since late 2017. 

The performance across the smaller auction markets as usual were quite varied, with Adelaide recording the highest clearance rate of 66.7 per cent, while only 31.6 per cent of homes sold in Perth.

Sydney is expected to see the most notable difference in volumes this week; increasing by 15 per cent on last week with a total of 775 homes scheduled for auction. 

Australia’s other largest auction market Melbourne is set to host 1,064 auctions this week, remaining somewhat consistent on the 1,033 auctions held last week at final results. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Tasmania is the only other auction market to see a rise in week-on-week volumes, with Adelaide and Perth down more than 30 per cent on last week, while Brisbane and Canberra’s volumes are down to a lesser degree.

When compared to activity last year, both volumes and clearance rates were tracking considerably higher, with 2,885 auctions held on this same week one year ago when the success rate of auctions were tracking consistently above the 70 per cent mark throughout the first half of 2017; a much different trend to what we are currently seeing.


Craigieburn in Victoria is the busiest suburb for auctions this week, with 19 homes scheduled to go under the hammer, following closely with 18 auctions scheduled is Randwick in NSW, while Victoria’s Reservoir will host 16 auctions.

Summary of last week's results


The combined capital city auction market continues to soften throughout 2018; while volumes have remained relatively steady over each of the last 3 weeks the weighted average clearance rate has continued to decline. Last week, the combined capitals returned a final auction clearance rate at a record year-to-date low of 56.8 per cent, the last time clearance rates were tracking at a similar level was in early 2013.  With 2,100 homes taken to auction last week almost half of these failed to sell, over the same period last year the clearance rate was a much higher 73.1 per cent across 2,824 auctions.  


In Melbourne, the final auction clearance rate increased last week across a slightly lower volume of auctions, with 62 per cent of the 1,033 auctions reported as selling, up on the previous week when the final clearance rate across the city dropped below 60 per cent (59.8 per cent- 1,099 auctions).

Sydney’s final auction clearance rate fell to 54 per cent last week, the lowest recorded since late 2017, with 672 homes taken to auction which was lower than the week prior when 787 auctions were held and a higher 57.5 per cent cleared. 

Across the remaining auction markets, Adelaide was the only capital city to see a rise in clearance rate last week with volumes also increasing across the city.

"With the latest release of lending finance data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, we can now analyse the value of mortgage lending across each of the states and territories up until March 2018.  Housing finance data pointed to a slowing of demand with falls over the month in both investment and owner occupier demand.  It is important to note that the headline housing finance data is seasonally adjusted whereas this data is not.  The charts shown include monthly data and a six month rolling average.

 
In March 2018 there was $12.5 billion worth of housing finance commitments in NSW.  This figure was split between $2.4 billion for owner occupier refinances, $5.0 billion for new lending to owner occupiers and $5.1 billion for investors.  Investors remain the predominant type of borrower in the market, excluding refinances,  accounting for 50.2% of all new lending commitments by value. Despite the tighter credit, investors as a proportion of mortgage demand remain well above the long term average of 37.4%.  Dwelling values have been falling in Sydney since July 2017 and growth is slowing across the rest of NSW.  The recent data shows a clear declining trend in mortgage demand with both new lending to owner occupiers and investor lending falling recently.

 
There was $9.0 billion worth of housing finance commitments in Vic during March 2018.  The $9.0 billion was split between: $2.0 billion for owner occupier refinances, $4.1 billion for new loans to owner occupiers and $2.9 billion for investors.  Refinances are the only segment of lending which has remained relatively steady over recent months.  Excluding refinances, investors currently account for 41.7% of mortgage demand which is well down on the April 2015 peak of 54.7% but well above the long-term average share of 32.1%.

 
The $5.0 billion in housing finance in March 2018 was split between $1.0 billion for owner occupier refinances, $2.6 billion in owner occupier new loans and $1.4 billion in investor lending.  Refinance activity is pretty steady at the moment while investor credit has been trending lower for a long time while owner occupier new lending has also started trending lower over recent months.  In terms of investment, it currently accounts for 34.2% of total new mortgage lending compared to a long-term average of 34.8%.

 
SA had $1.5 billion worth of housing finance commitments in March 2018.  The $1.5 billion was split between $337.1 million in owner occupier refinances, $743.4 million in owner occupier new loans and $398.5 million in investor commitments.  New lending to owner occupiers has remained fairly steady over recent months while owner occupier refinancing and investor lending has been trending lower for some time.  Investors in SA account for 34.9% of lending (ex-refinances) currently compared to a long-term average of 28.3%.  

 
The $2.3 billion worth of housing finance commitments in WA throughout March 2018 was split between: $469.3 million for owner occupier refinances, $1.2 billion for owner occupier new loans and $596.6 million to investors.  Each of the three segments continue to see the value of lending drift lower which mirrors the ongoing weakness in WA housing demand and value declines.  Despite the ongoing decline in investor lending, they accounted for 32.6% of all new mortgage commitments in March 2018 compared to a long-term average of 29.1%. 

 
The $379.4 million in housing finance commitments for Tas in March 2018 was the third highest monthly value on record.  The data was split between $78.3 million for owner occupier refinances, $193.7 million in owner occupier new loans and $107.3 million in investor loans (which was also an historic high).  Demand for each of the three types of loans is rising while owner occupier new loans are the predominant source of demand.  Investor demand is certainly climbing, accounting for 35.7% of new mortgage demand over the month which was the highest share since October 2014 and much higher than the long-term average share of 22.7%.

 

 
The value of housing finance commitments in NT during March 2018 was recorded at $117.7 million and it continues to trend lower. Each of the three segments of lending are seeing a declining trend, over the month there was $19.3 million worth of commitments for owner occupier refinances, $63.3 million for owner occupier new loans and $35.0 million for investors.  Historically, owner occupier new loans and investors have accounted for a similar value of lending each month; investors currently account for 35.6% of total new mortgage lending which is slightly lower than the long-term average (36.1%).

 
The $677.2 million in housing finance commitments in ACT throughout March 2018 was split between: $114.1 million in owner occupier refinances, $353.1 in owner occupier new loans and $210.1 million to investors. Each of the owner occupier segments of lending are relatively steady while investor commitments are trending slightly lower.  Despite it edging a little lower, investors account for 37.3% of total new mortgage lending which is a little higher than the long-term average at 35.2%.

With dwelling values falling, the cost of new mortgages is likely to be less than it was in the past, particularly in NSW and Vic.  We’re also seeing the investor segment slowing and we would expect a further slowdown given the ongoing regulatory focus on interest only lending, mortgage rate premium and that fact that values are falling and rental yields are generally low; all of which make investment a less compelling prospect.  Overall, the outlook for mortgage demand is that it is likely to soften over the coming months, particularly in NSW and Vic while the prospects for a substantial pick-up elsewhere are fairly limited at this stage.

"Most agents - so the story goes - get into real estate because they love property and they love helping people. And the chance to earn a small fortune is pretty alluring too. 

But within just a few short months, they are destined to hate both houses and people - and be broke - burned out by psychotic vendors, ungrateful landlords, feral tenants and disgruntled buyers.

Why does it happen like this? What is it about real estate that brings out all the crazy people? And why does your agency seem to be the one that attracts them as clients?

A look at neurological and behavioural research provides some clues that indicate maybe it is not individual agents or offices that attract the unstable or unbalanced, but that the stress involved in buying and selling property is enough to make pretty much everyone feel unhinged.

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory argues that human psychological wellness is served by the meeting key needs. Until we feel secure at the base levels, we cannot move towards more enlightened behaviour. 


Shelter is one of our basic physiological needs according to Maslow. What does that mean for agents? It means that when humans feel their “shelter” is uncertain, they they feel their very survival is threatened on a subconscious level and are in a constant state of anxiety. Property is a key part of the second layer of needs – part of our safety and security. When property is insecure, this makes us feel endangered and unsafe. 

Selling a property is to walk headlong into these feelings of anxiety and distress that often refuse to be reasoned away. But so too is the feeling triggered for buyers who can’t find a property, or tenants struggling in the search for something suitable to rent. 

Want to know why your vendor is shouting at you? Or a potential buyer just slammed down the phone on you during the negotiation? It’s not because they’re nuts. It’s because subconsciously, there’s a voice telling them “You’re not safe. You have no shelter. You’re in danger!” and that anxiety is affecting their behaviour in a way that can’t always be rationalised away.

This is because new research from neuroscientists at the University of Pittsburgh has identified that anxiety disrupts the decision-making regions of your brain which can make it physically impossible to think clearly in some highly stressful situations, which in turn is likely to affect your behaviour. 

The study found that anxiety affects your prefrontal cortex – the front part of your brain responsible for understanding rules, the consequences of risk, problem solving and decision making. In doing so, it also affects our ability to regulate our emotions and control behaviour. 

So when you’re in the middle of an auction, pushing a vendor to accept the highest offer, when you’re negotiating with buyers who’ve missed out on numerous other properties, when you’re asking someone who has lived in a home for 40 plus years who has been prevaricating to sign the sales agreement – these are all times when our stress responses are in full flight and in fact, our brains are actively incapable of making a good choice or monitoring our behaviour.

But it doesn’t have to be like this. There are things real estate agents can do that can alleviate the stress their customers feel which will in turn improve the behaviour they demonstrate toward you. These include:

1.    Let people know what to do in case of an emergency

Every time you get on an airplane, the crew runs through the safety demonstration. You’ve seen it a million times, but it is based on the fact that in the event of an emergency when your brain is flooded with cortisol and you literally can’t think, you’ll revert to something that has been drummed into you. 

It’s a great approach that more agents could take too – because while there’s no way of avoiding the fact that buying or selling a property is stressful, as a real estate agent with extensive experience, you’ve seen everything before – so share that knowledge with your clients. 

Research from University College London identifies that the unexpected is more stressful, than the expected, even if what’s expected is painful. So explain to your clients what the selling (or buying, or renting) process looks like, where things sometimes go wrong, and how you proactively solve those things when they occur. Make sure you know their auction instructions well in advance and ensure they’ve been planned for quietly and rationally, so you can remind them of that decision, not ask for a new one. Hope for the best but plan for the worst is the mantra. Make solving the stress in advance part of your procedure. 

This has a two-fold affect – it reassures people that what’s happening to them is normal and it tells them that you’ve got their back and they are in good hands which goes a long way to establishing a relationship based on trust.

2.    Help clients take a break from the stressors

What is the most stressful thing about the sale process that is upsetting your vendor? Is it having the property clean in time for each open house? Is it making sure the dog is out of the house? And are there ways that you could give your client a break, even just once – by offering to organise a cleaner, or a dog sitter? 

Research from the American Psychological Association identifies that taking a break from stressors can be hugely beneficial, even if it’s just short term. Even a small gesture such as a voucher for coffees and a snack at the local café during the open tells them that you are noticing their behaviour, have empathy for what they’re going through and you’re there to support them. (and you can meet them for a coffee afterwards and let them know how it went).

3.    Encourage mindfulness

Both Persian and Jewish philosophers are credited with the saying “This too shall pass” – so dealing with stressful situations has been going on for millennia. But rather than enduring, modern psychology has identified that being able to visualise what the end result both looks like and feels like in a positive way is hugely powerful to reducing stress.

Sometimes your clients may resist this – if they’re selling a long-loved family home, the idea of leaving may terrify them and increase feelings of sadness. But encourage them to visualise how exciting it will once the hammer has fallen on auction day and they know how much money is coming in, how lovely their new home is going to be, all the things they will be able to achieve as part of their new chapter. 
 
If you’ve outlined your process for selling (or buying) in detail and your clients know what to expect each step of the way, they’ll find it easier to imagine positive outcomes.

Last week, 2,279 auctions were held and the final clearance rate dropped to 58.2 per cent, the lowest clearance rate seen since December 2015 so it will be interesting to see what happens as the final result are collected early next week. Over the same week last year, auction volumes were higher with 2,824 homes going under the hammer across the combined capital cities, returning a clearance rate of 73.1 per cent. 


In Melbourne, Australia’s largest auction market, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 64.2 per cent was recorded across 1,028 auctions this week, up from 59.8 per cent across 1,099 auctions last week, the lowest clearance rate the city has seen since Easter 2014. One year ago, the clearance rate was a stronger 77.9 per cent across 1,326 auctions. 


There were 669 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 60.8 per cent, compared to 57.5 per cent across 787 last week, and 74.0 per cent across 1,075 auctions one year ago. 

Across the smaller auction markets, preliminary results show that Canberra was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with a 66.2 per cent success rate across 79 auctions.

Over the same week last year, 2,824 homes went under the hammer across the combined capital cities, returning a clearance rate of 73.1 per cent.

All of the busiest suburbs for auctions this week are in Victoria. Reservoir tops the list with 19 homes set to go under the hammer, followed by Bentleigh East and Mount Waverley with 14 auctions each.

Summary of last week's results


Last week, a total of 2,279 auctions were held across combined capital cities, returning a final clearance rate of 58.2 per cent, the lowest clearance rate seen since late 2015. Over the previous week, 2,311 homes were taken to auction and a clearance rate of 62.1 per cent was recorded, while this time last year, the clearance rate was much stronger with 72.8 per cent of the 2,409 auctions returning a successful result.


Melbourne’s final clearance rate dropped to 59.8 per cent this week across 1,099 auctions making it the lowest clearance rate the city has seen since Easter 2014 (58.1 per cent).

"In Australia, we're obsessed with property. It’s in our DNA. The expectation to own our own home like our parents did is a dream shared by everyone- but in 2018, it’s a dream under threat.

Property prices are spiralling. The cost of Melbourne property has doubled over the past decade and now ranks as the 5th most expensive city in the world. Sydney currently ranks as the 2nd. With no end in sight, the dream of home ownership seems increasingly out of reach.

Traditionally young aspiring homebuyers have turned to the bank of Mum & Dad for assistance when saving for a deposit. Shouldering the entire burden may become increasingly prohibitive for parents however in the wave of ever-rising housing prices.

Thankfully, there could be a better way!

Teaming up with family and friends in a co-ownership arrangement can be a great way to establish a firm footing on the property ladder.

The idea of combining resources to take that first step into the property market may not be new – but it’s a concept ready to gain greater traction as property prices continue to rise, and Kohab - a new property platform is on a mission to help Australians own together.

How Does it Work?

Co-buying allows you to split the purchase and statutory expenses such as stamp duty on a property (and associated costs, legal, conveyancing, etc.) making it popular with first-home buyers struggling to save for a deposit.

It also means you enter the property market sooner, increase your buying power, and reduce the ongoing financial commitments.

Kohab suggests a number of reasons why purchasing with your friends or family makes good sense:

You already have an established level of trust in an existing relationship,
You may feel more secure, knowing you have a clear understanding of the other’s goals
Cutting the cost in half, thirds or quarters depending on how many people you buy with directly correlates to the size of the deposit and may even eliminate the need for an expensive LMI product. (Lenders Mortgage Insurance)
Reduction in statutory purchasing expenses, mortgage repayments and other ongoing costs.

Common scenarios of co-ownership with family and friends include:

Single children or a couple joining forces with parents, as a co-living party with co-investor.
Two parties co-living, such as young singles or flatmates looking to switch from renting to co-owning.
Siblings choosing to co-invest together.
Singles or young couples looking to get on the property ladder can also join forces with parents to invest in the house to help them get on the property ladder. The benefits for the co-investor parents is they have the added benefit of not needing to use their own house as collateral and their investment is secure with their names on the title when purchased as tenants in common. The benefits for the couple is they get on the property ladder and start to build equity much sooner.

The title ownership of the property can be split according to their separate interests and the co-living party can Part Own while paying Part Rent (on the value of the property they don't own). Making the investment for the co-investor potentially tax deductible as well as locking in any future capital gain.

“We often find adult children work hard to save for a deposit but this can take many years. The co-investment structure with support from their parents can help kick-start this journey to own a property much earlier.  We also find parents are happy to help but often have concerns that there is no formal arrangements with their children. Kohab offers a great solution” - Ben Peters, Senior Financial Planner, Diamond Blue Financial Services*

Wiping out the “What ifs”;

One of the largest obstacles to co-ownership with family and friends is the fear or concern that there may be a disagreement somewhere down the line and affecting the relationship between the parties.

This is why Kohab offers a defined co-ownership agreement. Click here to download their guide as to what’s in a co-ownership agreement and how it works to protect all parties.

When partnering with family and friends, it’s also important to make a plan to ensure you know what will occur if situations or goals change in the future.

“The correct legal structure gives peace of mind to all co-owners. Knowing the parties have identified and dealt with particular issues with appropriate legal recourse gives co-owners the confidence they need to enter into a productive co-ownership arrangement” - David Reid, Partner at Sparke Helmore Lawyers**”

If both parties decide to co-live in the property, they also need to set some ground rules for privacy, exclusive areas, sharing of resources and other items such as dealing with maintenance and paying bills etc.

For example, if Alex, a young single professional, enters into co-ownership with his brother Daniel, he may see it as a mid-term strategy and the best way to have equity in an appreciating asset. In the future he may wish to marry and, with his wife, buy their own home; or he may simply wish to sell his share to his co-owner brother Daniel or arrange for a third party to take up the ownership opportunity.

So, just knowing why co-ownership is important is not enough. It’s important to think about your needs and wants, to give you a clear vision of what the ownership structure will look like e.g. 50:50 or 60:40 or three ways 30:30:40, etc. Once you are clear on what you are looking for, you can talk with your family and friends about their wants and needs and start your journey of Owning Together from the same perspective.

In today’s market of high property prices, you need to think creatively, and it’s essential to have a plan for the future to give yourself the best possible chance of success when embarking on co-ownership. Where do you see the property in five years? Ten years? Is your goal to sell it, are you planning to raise a family - how do you think the value of the property will change over time?

Kohab, through their legal partner Sparke Helmore, has developed exit strategies, so that when the time comes, each party can handle the transition smoothly.

So when a situation arises, like someone wanting to sell, agreed scenarios can be put into effect, such as:

One buys the other out e.g. the children buy out their investor parent(s)
Both can sell on the open market
Find another co-owner
Both stay owning and agree on a Tenant
With preparation and understanding, co-ownership can be a winning move for both you and the family member or friend you partner with.

"This week we look at each capital city across the country and compare how close to the city you can get where houses typically cost under $500,000.

Finding a house close to the city centre for under $500,000 is becoming increasingly difficult.  In this week’s Pulse we look at the five suburbs in each capital city that are closest to the city centre and have a median house value under $500,000.  Obviously the options and distance from the city centre vary greatly across each of the individual capital cities.

Suburbs closest to a capital city GPO with a
median house value of less than $500,000

Sydney 

Bar Point is the suburb closest to the CBD with a median house value below $500,000. Sitting on the Central Coast as the crow flies it is 39.5km away from the CBD. There are only two suburbs within 50km of the CBD with a median house value below $500,000.

Melbourne

Dallas is the suburb closest to the Melbourne CBD with a median house value of less than $500,000. Located 16.1km from the CBD, the typical house costs less than $450,000.  There are only two suburbs within 20km of the CBD with a median house values of less than $500,000.

Brisbane 

Rocklea is the closest suburb to the city with a median house value below $500,000 and it is the only suburb below that price point within 10km of the CBD.  Once you move more than 10km from the CBD there are many options under $500,000.

Adelaide

Hindmarsh is just 3.5km from the Adelaide CBD and has a median house value well below $500,000. The five suburbs listed are all less than 5km from the city centre which highlights the affordability of well-located housing in Adelaide relative to other capital cities.

Perth

Glendalough which is just over 5km from the Perth CBD is the closest suburb to the city centre with a median house value below $500,000.  Relative to other cities there are quite a number of suburbs relatively close to the city centre with a median house value below $500,000.

Hobart 

Montagu Bay which is 3km from Hobart’s city centre is the closest suburb with a median house value of less than $500,000. Hobart remains the nation’s most affordable capital city housing market and, despite strong value growth recently, still has many suburbs with a median below $500,000 quite close to the city centre.

Darwin

Millner (8.1km from the CBD) is the suburb of Darwin closest to the city centre with a median house value under $500,000. Millner is also the only suburb with a median house value within 10km of the city centre.

Canberra

There is only one suburb in Canberra (Charnwood) that has a current median house value below $500,000.  This highlights the lack of affordable options in Canberra despite the fact that it is one of the smallest capital cities.

"Dwelling values, particularly those in Sydney and Melbourne, have been falling now for a number of months.  The latest ABS housing finance data indicates that the impact of these falls is now seemingly being felt in demand for new mortgages.  While the value of lending fell over the month for owner occupiers and investors, the slowdown was much more substantial for investors, and the sharp month-on-month fall follows a downwards trend that has been evident across several rounds of macro prudential measures over the past few years.  This isn’t really a surprise given so much of the lending to investors has been focused on Sydney and Melbourne and these cities are seeing values fall and yields at close to historic lows while investors are also incurring higher mortgage rates than owner occupiers, with additional rate premiums they use interest-only mortgages.

 
In March 2018 there was $31.9 billion worth of housing finance commitments which was the lowest monthly value of commitments since August 2016. Housing finance commitments were split between $21.0 billion to owner occupiers and $10.9 billion to investors.  Owner occupier commitments fell by -1.9% over the month to their lowest value since December 2017.  Investor finance commitments were down by -9.0% over the month, falling to their lowest value since January 2016.  The declining trend in investor housing finance commitments had slowed recently, however, the -9.0% monthly fall was the largest decline since September 2015 when they fell -10.4% over the month as lenders tightened in order to remain under the 10% APRA speed limit in annualised terms.

 
The $21.0 billion worth of finance commitments to owner occupiers was split between: $1.9 billion for construction of dwellings, $1.2 billion for purchase of new dwellings, $6.3 billion for the refinance of established dwellings and $11.6 billion for the purchase of established dwellings.  Each type of owner occupier commitment fell over the month however, year-on-year the value of lending for construction of dwellings was the only owner occupier finance segment that was lower.

  The $10.9 billion worth of investor housing finance commitments in March 2018 was split between $1.0 billion for construction of new dwellings and $9.9 billion for established dwellings.  The value of lending for new construction was -18.9% lower over the month while the value of commitments for established dwellings was -7.9% lower.  

 
Looking more broadly at finance commitments for new housing vs established housing shows a decline over the month for both.  The chart also shows how the established market, of which there are substantially more properties, dwarfs the new housing market.  Over the month there was $4.1 billion worth of commitments for new housing and $21.5 billion for existing housing (excluding refinances).  Commitments for new housing fell by -1.9% over the month while commitments for existing stock were -6.8% lower. 

A month’s worth of data doesn’t necessarily indicate a trend but it was quite a substantial fall in the value of housing finance commitments in March, particularly for investors.  CoreLogic has believed for some time that investment in housing, particularly in the most expensive markets of Sydney and Melbourne, made little sense given stretched affordability, yield compression and little near-term value growth prospects with values currently declining.  Despite this, lending finance data (which will be updated next Tuesday) has continued to show investor activity which is well above average levels in NSW and Vic.  We would expect that the coming release will show a further weakening of demand in these two states.

Over the coming months it is anticipated that mortgage activity, particularly from the investment sector will remain weak relative to recent years.  With APRA recently announcing they will lift the 10% speed limit on investment credit growth from July 1, it will be important to watch the trend in investment credit flows.  

There have been recent reports that lenders are starting to reduce the interest rate premiums on some interest only loans and investment loans, however any reduction in rates could be offset by stricter serviceability testing on borrower expenses and incomes as well as the prospect for renewed focus from lenders to reduce their exposure to high loan to income ratio loans as well as maintaining their reluctance to take on high loan to valuation ratio loans.

"Preliminary clearance rate weakens and auction volumes drop slightly across the combined capital cities.

There were 2,245 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 61.0 per cent, while last week, 2,311 auctions were held and the final clearance rate came in at 62.1 per cent. Over the same week last year, auction volumes were higher with 2,409 homes going under the hammer across the combined capital cities, and the clearance rate was a stronger 72.8 per cent. 


If we look at results by property type, units outperformed the house market this week with 63.6 per cent of units selling at auction, while 59.8 per cent of houses sold across the combined capital cities.


In Melbourne, Australia’s largest auction market, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 61.2 per cent was recorded across 1,090 auctions this week, down from 63.7 per cent across 1,144 auctions last week. One year ago, the clearance rate was a stronger 75.0 per cent across 1,098 auctions. There were 767 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 62.5 per cent, compared to 63.1 per cent across 797 last week, and 74.5 per cent across 960 auctions one year ago. 


Once clearance rates are finalised early next week, its highly likely they will be revised lower, with both Sydney and Melbourne clearance rates potentially falling below the 60% mark.

Across the smaller auction markets, preliminary results show that Canberra was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with a 77.1 per cent success rate across 80 auctions.

"The combined capital cities are expected to see a lower volume of auctions this week with CoreLogic currently tracking 2,055 auctions, down from 2,311 last week. Melbourne is the busiest city for auctions this week, with 1,012 auctions being tracked so far, down from 1,144 last week. Sydney has 696 auctions scheduled this week, down from 797 last week. 

Brisbane and Tasmania are expecting to see an increase in auction volumes this week, with Brisbane tracking 146 auctions, up from 127 last week, while Tasmania currently has 9 auctions scheduled, up from 5 last week.  

Perth has 37 auctions scheduled this week, similar to last week when 39 homes went to auction, while Adelaide and Canberra are expecting fewer auctions week-on-week.

Over the same week last year, 2,409 homes went under the hammer across the combined capital cities, returning a clearance rate of 72.8 per cent. 


All of the busiest suburbs for auctions this week are in Victoria. Reservoir tops the list with 22 homes set to go under the hammer, followed by Camberwell with 18 scheduled auctions, while Brighton and Kew will host 16 auctions each.

Summary of last week's results


Last week, the combined capital cities saw auction volumes fall with a total of 2,311 auctions held, returning a final clearance rate of 62.1 per cent, up from the previous week when the lowest clearance rate over the year-to-date was recorded (60.3 per cent across 2,577 auctions). Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was much stronger with 73.0 per cent of the 1,689 auctions returning a successful result.


Melbourne’s final clearance rate has been fairly stable over the last 3 weeks. Last week’s final clearance rate came in at 63.7 per cent across 1,144 auctions, compared to 63.9 per cent across 1,334 auctions the previous week. This time last year, 792 homes went under the hammer, returning a clearance rate of 77.5 per cent.

Sydney’s final auction clearance rate increased to 63.1 per cent across 797 auctions last week, after falling to 55.8 per cent across 829 auctions over the previous week, the lowest clearance rate recorded across the city all year. Over the same week last year, 592 homes went to auction and a clearance rate of 73.8 per cent was recorded.

Across the smaller auction markets, Canberra was the only city to see an increase in auction volumes with 102 auctions held, up from 92 over the previous week. Clearance rates were varied with Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth recording lower clearance rates week-on-week. 

Of the non-capital city auction markets, Geelong returned the highest final clearance rate of 75.0 per cent across 58 auctions.

"It’s intuitive that housing market conditions would have a close relationship with credit flows; when funds are flowing freely and rates are low, home buyers and investors step up their presence in the housing market and when credit is harder to come by or more expensive, things slow down.

Since 2015, things have become a bit more complex, and the correlation between dwelling value appreciation and housing credit has become tighter; especially when measured against investment credit.

Since macro prudential measures were announced and implemented by APRA, the trends in housing related credit have changed remarkably.  Soon after APRA announced the ten percent annual speed limit for investment lending in December 2014, investment housing finance commitments peaked at 55% of mortgage demand and investment credit growth moved through a cyclical peak rate of annual growth at 10.8%.  Around the same time, the quarterly rate of home value appreciation peaked in Sydney and Melbourne; the two cities where investment has been most concentrated.

As credit policies were tightened in response to the APRA limits, then loosened as lenders overachieved their APRA targets, the housing market responded virtually in concert.  Interest rate cuts in May and August of 2016 helped to support a rebound in the pace of capital gains, however as lenders came close to breaching the 10% limit, at least on a monthly annualised basis, credit once again tightened and the second round of macro prudential, announced in March 2017, saw credit availability restricted further.  

The result of changes in credit availability has been evident across most housing markets, but is very clear in Sydney and Melbourne; dwelling values started to track lower in Sydney from July last year and peaked in Melbourne in November last year. 

More recently, there are some early signs that Sydney’s housing market is already achieving a soft landing, probably earlier than expected.  The monthly rate of decline has eased from 0.9% in December and January to reach 0.6% in February and 0.3% in March.  The easing rate of decline comes as investment credit flows have ticked up a notch and some lenders have announced a reduction in the mortgage rate premiums being paid by investors and interest only borrowers.

Whether the improvement in Sydney’s housing market is temporary or not will be largely dependent on credit policies.  It’s hard to imagine any lender would be aggressively ramping up their share of investment loans, despite the fact that APRA benchmarks have been so comprehensively achieved.  Investment credit growth is currently tracking at just 2.8% per annum and interest only originations were tracking at around 15% in December last year; roughly half the 30% APRA benchmark.  Despite over shooting the benchmarks, considering the Royal Commission is under way and there is a great deal of focus on lending practices, the likelihood is that investment related credit may step up a notch, but not likely enough to cause a sharp rebound in housing market conditions like what we saw through 2016.

"With the release of regional population and migration data for 2016-17, we take a look at where people migrating away from capital cities are ending up moving to.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) recently released regional population growth data for 2016-17.  The data included information on internal migration showing where people were moving to.  Using this data we can determine when people migrate away from a capital city where they are settling.  For this we are looking at internal movements from the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) to other SA4 regions across the country.

Of those people shifting out of Sydney, the most popular destinations were those directly adjacent to the city: Newcastle/Lake Macquarie and Illawarra.  The Australian Capital Territory and Gold Coast also recorded more than 5,000 person arrivals from Sydney over the past year.  Six of the top 10 regions for arrival of former Sydney residents were within New South Wales with the remaining for in ACT, Qld and Vic.

The top 5 regions of arrival for former residents of Melbourne are all within Victoria and they are all directly adjacent to Melbourne. Latrobe-Gippsland (7,259) and Geelong (6,894) have attracted the greatest number of former Melbourne residents over the past year.  7 of the top 10 regions for arrivals of former Melbourne residents were in Victoria with the Gold and Sunshine Coasts in Qld and the ACT accounting for the other three regions in the top 10.


7 of the top 10 regions for arrivals of departing residents of Brisbane are also located in Qld.  The Gold and Sunshine Coasts record a much greater number of arrivals from Brisbane than any of the other regions on the list.  Interestingly, the data also suggests that those migrating away from Brisbane to other areas of Qld tend to remain in the southern areas of the state.  The three regions of top migration from Brisbane that aren’t within the state are Melbourne-Inner, Richmond-Tweed (directly adjacent to the Gold Coast) and the ACT.


A reasonably large number of residents leaving Adelaide move to other regions of SA (noting there are only 3 regional SA4 areas in SA).  The South-East region of the state is the most popular for departing Adelaide residents followed by Barossa-Yorke-Mid North.  Melbourne is also a popular region for those departing Adelaide accounting for 3 of the top 10 regions with the ACT, Darwin, Gold Coast and Parramatta also making the list for regions outside of SA.


It is perhaps a little surprising that the top destinations for departing residents of Perth are within Western Australia and not interstate.  The 4 regional SA4 regions of the state are also the top 4 destinations for those migrating out of Perth.  Regions of Melbourne account for 3 of the remaining 5 locations outside of WA with Darwin, Gold Coast and ACT also making the list.


The most popular region for residents of Hobart that move out of the city is the surrounding South East region.  In fact, the South East has seen double the number of migrants from Hobart than Launceston and the North East in second place.  Note that there are only 3 SA4 regions of Tas outside of Greater Hobart and they are each listed.  Outside of Tas, 4 regions are in Vic (each of which are in Melbourne), 2 regions are in Qld and the remaining region is the ACT.


When residents of Darwin move away from the city, the greatest share of them move to other parts of the Territory outside of the capital city.  Qld is a popular destination from Darwin residents moving away with 5 of the top 10 regions listed within the state and all except for Ipswich being in coastal locations.  The top 10 list also includes one region each in Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide as well as the ACT.


Residents of Canberra that leave don’t have the option to move elsewhere within the territory however, a substantial number of them move to the Capital Region located adjacent in NSW.  7 of the 10 most popular regions for people from Canberra to migrate to are in NSW and 6 of them are in Sydney. Elsewhere in the top 10 Canberrans have migrated to 2 regions of Melbourne and the Gold Coast.


The data shows that overall a significant number of those people that moved away from a capital city over the past financial year moved to an area adjacent to the capital city.  Some of these are coastal/lifestyle markets while also being locations where housing is more affordable.  The reality is the reasons for moving to these locations likely vary somewhat from one in which the residents are seeking more affordable housing or one in which residents are looking for a seachange/treechange.

"The latest annual taxation data shows that state and local government coffers were boosted by $52.5 billion in 2016-17 due to taxes on property.

Each year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) releases taxation statistics and the latest data for 2016-17 was released recently.  Over the 2016-17 financial year, state and local governments collected $52.5 billion in taxes from property with the figure climbing by 5.9% over the year.  The taxation take from property is now more than double what it was in 2005-06.  Property taxes accounted for an historic high 52.8% of all tax revenue for state and local governments, up from 51.9% over the previous year.  


Property taxes are broken down into two broad types, taxes on immovable property and taxes on financial and capital transactions.  Taxes on immovable property include: land tax, municipal rates and other smaller taxes.  Taxes on financial and capital transactions include predominately stamp duties as well as a few other smaller taxes.  Taxes on immovable property were recorded at $29.185 billion over the year with the remaining $23.338 billion being taxes on financial and capital transactions.  Over the year, taxes on immovable property increased by 7.9% while taxes on financial and capital transactions increased by 3.6%.


The table highlights the value of taxation revenue between 2006-07 and 2016-17 across each state and territory for land tax, municipal rates and stamp duty, which are the three largest sources of taxation revenue at the state and local government level.  Probably the most notable change over the period has been the uplift in revenue, particularly from stamp duty, in NSW and Vic which reflects the strength of these housing markets over the past decade relative to other states and territories.

Between 2006-07 and 2016-17, stamp duty revenue in NSW has increased by 115% and it has increased by 114% in Vic.  Revenue from land taxes have doubled over the period in Vic (153%), Qld (123%) and WA (125%) while revenue from municipal rates has doubled over the period in WA (125%) and ACT (184%). 

In NSW, stamp duty revenue accounted for 49.1% of all property tax revenue in 2016-17 up from a recent low of 32.3% in 2008-09.  It is a similar story in Vic where stamp duty revenue accounted for 42.6% of property tax revenue, up from a recent low of 36.5% in 2012-13.  The cyclical nature of housing market transactions makes stamp duty a volatile source of revenue for state governments.  Another way to look at this is in WA where the housing market has been weak for a number of years, stamp duty revenue accounted for just 28.5% of all property related tax revenue in 2016-17 down from a peak of 54.5% in 2007-08.

From here, we are now seeing the combined effect of dwelling values and transaction numbers falling in Sydney and Melbourne along with a number of regional areas of NSW.  Both the NSW and Vic governments have benefitted substantially from stamp duty revenue over recent years and it now appears set to fall over the coming years as the housing market weakens after a number of years of surging values.

With a volatile source of taxation revenue such as stamp duty that taxes the small proportion of individuals that transact property each year, moving away from a transactional tax to a tax on all physical properties seems to make a lot of sense.  Especially considering transaction volumes remain well below their peak and stamp duty revenue growth is largely being driven by higher values rather than a greater number of transactions. Of course the transition to a broad based land tax will be difficult and recent owners may have to be compensated however, a more guaranteed source of revenue for state and territory governments means that they can much better plan for the future rather than being reliant on dwelling values and transactions remaining high in order to boost revenue.

Over the second half of 2017 and into 2018 we have seen residential housing markets weaken with values and transactions falling, particularly in NSW and Vic.  As a result we would expect over the current financial year that stamp duty revenue will fall and as a result so will total property taxation revenue.

"The combined capital cities are expected to see a lower volume of auctions this week. CoreLogic is currently tracking 2,075 auctions, down on final results last week which saw 2,577 auctions held. While a significantly lower 1,689 auctions were held over the corresponding week last year.

Both Melbourne and Sydney, Australia’s two largest markets are set to see fewer auctions take place this week, with 1,035 Melbourne homes currently scheduled to go under the hammer, down from 1,334 last week and 706 auctions scheduled across Sydney, decreasing from the 826 auctions held last week.

All of the remaining capital cities are also expected to host fewer auctions this week.


This week, all of the busiest suburbs for auctions are in Victoria; topping the list with 20 scheduled auctions is Craigieburn. Following closely with 18 auctions is Northcote, while Preston and Reservoir will host 16 auctions each. 

Summary of last week's results


Last week, the combined capital cities saw auction volumes increase with a total of 2,577 held, the higher volumes returned a final auction clearance rate of 60.3 per cent, which was lowest weighted average clearance rate seen over the year-to-date, down on the week prior when 62.2 per cent of auctions were successful (1,799 auctions).  


Melbourne’s final auction clearance rate last week maintained strength across a higher volume of auctions week-on-week, with a total of 1,334 auctions held returning a 63.9 per cent rate of clearance, increasing slightly from the week prior when 63.6 per cent of the 914 auctions held were successful.
 
Sydney’s final auction clearance rate dropped to its lowest level over the year-to-date, with only 55.8 per cent of auctions clearing. There were 829 auctions held across the city, which was considerably higher than the 588 auctions held over the week prior when a much stronger 63.6 per cent cleared. 

All of the smaller auction markets saw an increase in activity last week; clearance rates were varied however, with Adelaide and Tasmania showing a fall week-on-week, while Brisbane and Perth returned stronger results, and Canberra’s clearance rate remained steady.

Of the non-capital city auction markets, Geelong returned the highest final clearance rate of 67.7 per cent across 44 auctions.

"Real estate agents frequently forget how hard buying or selling a house is. There is just so much ‘homework’ you have to do – so much research to make sure you understand how the market is performing, so much to read and so much information that must be digested to keep abreast of – you’d be forgiven for feeling like it’s a major exam you must pass. 

But when an information is presented to you in video, the science shows that humans both understand it more quickly than reading, and find it easier to remember. Plus there’s a host of other benefits. That means that the real estate agents who embrace video are seen by consumers as being more helpful and therefore more trustworthy than average agents and get more mileage from their marketing dollar. 

Here are some more reasons why you agents need video.
1.    Video makes it easier to understand complex data concepts at a glance

A team of neuroscientists from MIT has found that the human brain can process entire images that the eye sees in as little as 13 milliseconds. That’s infinitely faster – and less taxing on your brain – than having to read great swathes of text. Videos that provide an overview on market performance are more likely to be understood and remembered.

2.    The majority of online traffic is now to view video

In 2017, 74% of online traffic was to view video according to Forbes Magazine. By 2019, Cisco estimates it will be 80% demonstrating that video is significantly driving online behaviour.

3.    Four times as many consumers would prefer to watch a video than read about a product. 

According to Forbes Magazine, the joke that most people would prefer to wait for the movie than read the book is absolutely true. But you don’t need Hollywood production values to make video work for you. Even the simplest videos are preferable over long text-based explainers.

4.    Video posts have 135% better reach on Facebook than photos

Research from Socialbakers shows that videos have an average organic reach of 8.7% on Facebook compared to just 2.7% for photos. And when boosted, videos perform even more strongly again ensuring you get more bang for your Facebook buck. 

5.    The use of video in emails more than doubles click-through rates

If your email is like most, it has an open rate of less than 20% and a conversion rate that is around 2%. The action on that? Even lower. Inboxes are so cluttered these days, it’s hard to make your piece of correspondence stand out, but a video both captures attention, and imparts the information more quickly. Major tech case studies show video improves open and click through rates by up to 500%, especially when it is personal 

6.    55% of people watch videos on their phone everyday

Google calls them ‘micro-moments’ – that time on the bus or the train or in a queue when the phone comes out and you look for something to do. Increasingly, we’re watching video on our phones and turning to it to understand what to do, where to go or what to buy next. 

7.    Audiences are 10 x more likely to embed, share, comment and engage with video

According to TechCrunch, 100 million hours of video are watched every day on Facebook, while the Content Marketing Institute reports that 61 of the top 100 companies in the US now embed YouTube videos onto their websites.

"Regional population growth data was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the 12 months to June 2017 recently.  The data provides a lot of detail about population trends; perhaps one of the most interesting pieces of data is the small area migration information.  In this blog, we look at arrivals and departures both internally (ie interstate and intrastate moves) and overseas across the SA2 regions of the country.

 
The above table shows the 25 SA2 regions across the country that recorded the greatest number of internal arrivals over the year.  The list is quite mixed and is clearly dominated by outer regions of Melbourne where there is significant new housing supply.    A number of outer regions of Sydney, Perth and south-east Queensland have also made the list.  While generally it is outer areas of cities on the list, there are a handful of inner city markets also, which highlights the impact of increased unit construction as inner city precincts densify.  


 
Taking a look at the top 25 regions where residents are departing to other parts of the country also makes for quite interesting reading.  While the list of regions for internal arrivals was largely dominated by outer regions of large population centres, a high proportion of the regions listed here are inner-city markets.  Sydney and Melbourne specifically are quite prominent on the list highlighting that an increasing number of residents of these cities are now looking to move elsewhere.  This is supported by broader quarterly demographic data, particularly for NSW, with it showing an increase in interstate departures with Qld the favourite destination.

 


The above table shows the top 25 SA2 regions for overseas arrivals over the most recent year.  The list includes almost exclusively either inner city locations or areas that are close to major universities.  This highlights the fact that education is a major export and is contributing to stronger demand for housing in those regions close to universities and/or in inner-city locations.  Also note that Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast is not adjacent to a university (although Bond University is located further south on the Gold Coast) and it is also the only region listed that isn’t in either Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth. 


The above table details the 25 SA2 regions of the country that have recorded the greatest number of overseas departures.  Interestingly, 23 of the regions listed were also included in the table for top regions for overseas arrivals.  The two regions that weren’t listed on the previous table were: Adelaide and South Yarra-East.  Although 23 of these regions appear on the two lists, for each of those 23 regions the number of overseas arrivals over the past year was greater than the number of departures.  This seems to suggest that both a share of the overseas arrivals that come to Australia to study leave as well as the fact that the more recent overseas arrivals are largely choosing to settle in the same places as other overseas arrivals.

Looking across the four tables shown, it is interesting to note that three SA2 regions appeared within each.  These regions were: Melbourne, Perth City and Waterloo-Beaconsfield.  This would seem to suggest that whether locals or overseas arrivals move in or out of these regions there are others that are very willing to move in.  

Overall the data highlights that residents are showing a preference for shifting to either the outskirts of major capital cities where new housing is being built at lower prices, or inner city areas where new higher density properties are being built.  Residents are moving away inner-city locations, particularly those in Sydney and Melbourne.  Foreign arrivals are largely choosing to move to inner-city locations and those close to universities which highlights the reason for overseas arrivals to Australia.  A large number of overseas departures are also occurring in these regions however, arrivals are outweighing departures.

"The combined capital cities saw fewer homes taken to auction this week, with a total of 2,280 held, down on last week when 2,577 were held.  

The lower volumes saw an improved preliminary clearance rate over the week, returning a 63.5 per cent success rate, increasing on the week prior’s final clearance rate which was the lowest weighted average result seen over the year-to-date with 60.3 per cent of properties selling.


Once again the combined unit market outperformed houses, returning a 67.7 per cent clearance rate, while a lower 61.7 per cent of houses sold.  A similar trend is evident in CoreLogic indices which show the unit market outperforming house values as housing demand slides towards the more affordable segments of the market.


Although the preliminary clearance rate has shown a positive rise over the week, the trend in auction clearance rates, based on the more complete final results, clearly shows a downwards trend in clearance rates.  Auction markets remain more buoyant than December last year, when Sydney clearance rates reached a low point of 52 percent, however the weaker auction results suggest housing market conditions are likely to remain relatively soft. 


Looking at results over the corresponding year-to-date period last year, the capital city auction market was performing quite differently, with an average of 10 per cent more homes selling over the same period last year, while weekly volumes continue to show similar trends. 

Melbourne returned a preliminary clearance rate of 63.5 per cent this week across 1,137 auctions, down on last week when 1,334 auctions took place and a higher 63.9 per cent cleared. In Sydney, 774 auctions were held this week with 66.9 per cent selling, increasing on last week when only 55.8 per cent of auctions were successful across a slightly higher 829 auctions.

Results were varied across the smaller auction markets this week, with Canberra and Perth recording a slight increase in week-on-week volumes, while the remaining markets saw fewer auctions take place. In terms of clearance rates, Canberra was the strongest performer this week with 74.2 per cent of homes selling, while only 18.2 per cent of Perth homes sold.

"With the release of March 2018 quarter CPI data it shows that in inflation adjusted terms, dwelling values are now lower than they were at their peak in most capital cities.

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the consumer price index (CPI), which measures inflation, increased by 0.4% over the March 2018 quarter to be 1.9% higher year-on-year.  With the release of this data, it is also possible to look at inflation-adjusted or real changes in dwelling values across the capital cities.  When looking at these figures, the inflation adjustment means that value growth is lower.

Nationally, dwelling values fell by -1.0% and were -0.7% lower over the past 12 months.  Hobart was the only capital city in which real values increased over the quarter (+3.0%) with Sydney recording the largest quarterly fall (-2.2%).  Over the past twelve months, only Melbourne (+3.4%), Hobart (+10.9%) and Canberra (+1.0%) have seen dwelling values outpace inflation.  The largest decline over the year was recorded in Darwin (-9.3%) followed by Perth (-4.3%) and Sydney (-4.0%).


Over the past decade, only Sydney (+43.3%) Melbourne (+38.7%) and Hobart (+6.4%) have recorded ‘real’ growth in dwelling values.  These figures really highlight how narrow value growth has been in the national housing market has been over the past decade.  It also highlights that low mortgage rates alone have not been the key driver of value growth.  Mortgage rates are the same in Sydney as they are in Perth yet the former has recorded real growth of 43.3% while the latter has seen values fall by -25.0%.


With dwelling values having fallen over recent months, all capital cities, except Hobart, now have real values which sit below their previous peak.

Nationally, values are -2.0% lower than their June 2017 peak and across the combined capital cities values are a slightly greater -2.5% lower.  Let’s take a look at how dwelling values have tracked in inflation adjusted terms across each capital city.

Sydney – values are 5.3% lower than their June 2017 peak.

Melbourne – after peaking in December 2017, values are currently -0.9% lower.

Brisbane – values peaked back in March 2008 and are currently -12.5% lower.

Adelaide – values currently sit -7.4% below their June 2010 peak.

Perth – the city has seen values fall by -28.5% from their peak in December 2006.

Hobart – with values increasing a further 10.9% over the past year, it is the only city where real dwelling values are currently at their peak.

Darwin – real dwelling values peaked in March 2013 and have since fallen by -28.2%.

Canberra – dwelling values are -6.8% lower than their June 2010 peak.


Although the rate of inflation is quite slow and remains below the Reserve Bank’s target range of 2% to 3% annually, value growth is now broadly slower and is expected to remain that way over the coming quarters.  As a result, when looking at inflation-adjusted dwelling values the expectation is that they will continue to fall over the coming quarters.  What this means is that as the cost of other items increases and inflation rises, relatively speaking, the cost of housing will reduce.  This has been occurring in most capital cities for a number of years but is a relatively recent development in Sydney and Melbourne.  The flow-on effect of value falls remains to be seen but it could result in less expenditure elsewhere across the economy, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne which have had strong retail demand over recent years due to the wealth-effect of increasing dwelling values.

"After many years of strong increases in dwelling values, the two largest housing markets, Sydney and Melbourne, have begun to see values fall over recent months.  While values are declining in both cities the speed of the declines vary greatly, both compared to one another and compared to other recent downturns in these housing markets.

 
Since values peaked back in July 2017, Sydney dwelling values have fallen by -3.9% over the following eight months.  If we look at the three previous downturns highlighted in the above chart, in the 2003-06 downturn values had fallen by -5.8% eight months in and went on to decline by -8.2% over 25 months before values started rising again.  In the 2008-09 downturn, values were -4.9% lower eight months in and went on to fall by -7.0% over 12 months.  The 2010-11 downturn saw values fall from their peak to their trough by -3.7% and after 8 months they had fallen by just -1.0%.

 
Dwelling values in Melbourne have not been falling as quickly or for as long as those in Sydney.  After the market peaked in November of last year, values have fallen by -0.7% over the four months to March 2018.  In 2003-04, values fell by a total of -3.0% over nine months and were -1.0% lower after four months of declines.  In 2008-09 values fell for 11 months, they had fallen by -3.9% over the first four months and ended up declining by -9.4%.  In the first four months of the 2010-12 period of value falls values were -2.2% lower before they ultimately fell by -8.4%.  Outside of these recent declines, values recorded a peak to trough fall of -8.3% between 1989 and 1992 with values falling by -2.5% over the first four months of this period.

Two other capital cities, Perth and Darwin, have been recording value falls for some time.  Although their declines are somewhat lengthier and different to recent falls in Sydney and Melbourne, it is valuable to analyse how these declines have evolved.

 
Perth dwelling values increased in March 2018 however, over the period from June 2014 to February 2018 values fell by -11.0%.  There is no guarantee that these declines are over as yet although the pace of these declines has steadied recently.  It is also interesting to note that during the most recent period of value falls the declines began much more moderately on a month-to-month bases than they did in 2006-07, 2008-09 and 2010-11, with the downturn stretching on much longer than any of these previous downturns.  In 2006-07, values fell by -3.7% in five months, in 2008-09 values were -11.0% lower over 13 months and in 2010-11 values declined by -9.1% over 19 months.

 
Darwin has only seen two recent period of market downturn, between October 2010 and September 2011 and from May 2014 to February 2018 (values rose over March 2018).  Again, it should be noted although values have risen over the month it doesn’t necessarily mean the downturn is over.  Over the 11 month downturn in 2010 and 2011, Darwin dwelling values fell by -7.9%.  The more recent downturn saw value declines start slower than those in 2010-11 with the downturn stretching for much longer.  As at February 2017 Darwin dwelling values have fallen by -22.3% from its previous peak in May 2014.

While these charts are interesting to consider they don’t provide any particular guidance as to how deep or elongated the current downturns in Sydney and Melbourne may be.  The weak housing market conditions in Perth and Darwin were largely a symptom of weak economic and demographic conditions, while the current downturns in Sydney and Melbourne are occurring against reasonably strong economic and demographic conditions; the slowdown is primarily being influenced by tighter credit conditions.  

What is interesting is that comparing to Perth and Darwin shows that just because they have started falling slower than other housing market downturns doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t end up as a deeper and longer downturn.  Of course the reverse is true as well but it will be interesting to see how deep and how long these current downturns persist for in Sydney and Melbourne and whether they lead to downturns in other cities and regions too.

"The number of homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities rose this week, with a total of 2,539 held, the higher volumes returned a preliminary clearance rate of 62.5 per cent. Last week, there were 1,799 capital city auctions returning a 62.2 per cent final clearance rate.

The combined capital city auction market has seen a relatively steady performance over the year-to-date, with the average weighted clearance rate continuing to track around the low-to-mid 60 per cent range for most of this year despite the level of activity over each week. 


Combined results split by property type show the smaller segment of the auction market continued to outperform for another week, with 64.4 per cent of units selling at auction while 61.6 per cent of houses sold this week. 


Melbourne saw an increase in clearance rates and volumes this week, with a total of 1,326 Melbourne homes taken to auction returning a preliminary clearance rate of 65.5 per cent, up on the 63.6 per cent last week when a lower 914 auctions were held.  


As volumes rose across Sydney this week, the preliminary clearance rate dropped below 60 per cent for the first time since the first week of February earlier this year.  The preliminary clearance rate showed 59.8 per cent of the 805 auctions held reportedly sold, however this will likely revise lower as results are finalised early in the week.

Each of the smaller auction markets recorded an increase in auction activity this week; the higher activity saw week-on-week clearance rates strengthen across Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth, while Canberra and Tasmania returned lower clearance rates.

"This week, the number of auctions scheduled to take place across the combined capital cities is expected to rise, with 2,342 currently being tracked by CoreLogic, increasing from the 1,799 auctions held last week at final results and similar to the volume of auctions held over the same week last year (2,350).

Both Melbourne and Sydney is expected to see an increase in activity this week, with 1,218 homes scheduled for auction across Melbourne, while Sydney is set to host 737 auctions, increasing on the 914 and 588 auctions held last week respectively.

All of the smaller auction markets will also see a higher volume of auctions this week compared to last.


This week, all of the busiest suburbs for auctions are in Victoria; Hoppers Crossing tops the list with 21 homes scheduled to go to under the hammer, followed by Craigieburn with 18 scheduled auctions, while Port Melbourne, Reservoir and Richmond each have 16 scheduled auctions. 

Summary of last week's results


Last week, the final auction clearance rate increased to 62.2 per cent after the week prior saw the final clearance rate drop to its lowest level seen over the year-to-date, returning a 61.7 per cent success rate. In retrospect both clearance rates and auction volumes across the combined capitals have remained relatively steady over each of the last 3 weeks, with clearance rates consistently in the low 60 per cent range and volumes around the 1,800- 1,900 level.  


Melbourne and Sydney returned an equal 63.6 per cent auction clearance rate last week, both recording an increase on the week prior when 62.4 per cent of Melbourne auctions cleared and a 61.5 per cent success rate was recorded across Sydney.  Looking at volume of auctions, Melbourne recorded a slightly higher volume week-on-week with 914 held, increasing on the 873 the previous week, while Sydney saw a fall in activity with 588 auctions held, down on the 795 auction held the week prior.

The performance across the smaller auction markets were mixed last week, with clearances rates improving in Brisbane and Tasmania, while Adelaide, Canberra and Perth all saw a fall in the final clearance rate over the week.

Of the non-capital city regions, Geelong recorded the highest clearance rate with 85.3 per cent of auctions clearing last week.

"The Reserve Bank’s hold decision was widely anticipated, considering core inflation is only just nudging the bottom of the RBA’s target range at 2.0% and the labour market continues to show plenty of spare capacity with an unemployment rate of 5.5%.  Of course, the heat has also come out of the housing market, with CoreLogic today reporting another slip in national home values in April, largely driven by weaker conditions in Sydney and Melbourne.  Nationally, dwelling values have been moving through a controlled slowdown since October last year which has taken a great deal of pressure away from the RBA to lift rates in order to curb exuberance in dwelling investment.  Housing investment has well and truly slowed without any direct intervention from the RBA, highlighted by the fact that credit growth for housing is tracking at an annual growth rate of just 2.5%.  

Macroprudential policies, which have led to mortgage rate premiums and tighter credit policies, provided the heavy lifting needed to slow down investment activity.   While Friday’s Statement on Monetary Policy will provide better guidance around the RBA’s thinking, financial markets are still betting that the cash rate won’t rise until July 2019.  Chances are that official interest rates are likely to be on hold for the foreseeable future, however it remains likely that the next move will be up, not down.  Importantly, mortgage rates could be under some upwards pressure without any change in the cash rate, considering wholesale funding costs are rising as US interest rates push higher.  

Considering the record high levels of household debt and growing number of interest only loans transitioning to principal and interest terms, higher mortgage rates will test the housing markets resilience.

The results segregated by property type showed that units outperformed houses this week, with 65 per cent of units selling, while the combined houses returned a 62.2 per cent success rate; conversely the house market accounts for a higher proportion of overall auction activity.


Melbourne saw a total of 905 auctions take place this week, returning a 63.8 per cent preliminary clearance rate, which was slightly higher than the 62.4 per cent over the week prior when 873 auctions were held.

The number of homes taken to auction across Sydney fell this week, with 551 held. The lower volumes returned a higher week-on-week clearance rate with 66.4 per cent of properties reportedly selling, increasing on the week prior’s 61.5 per cent final clearance rate when volumes were higher (795).

The performance across the smaller auction markets continues to be quite varied, with Tasmania returning the highest preliminary clearance rate of 75 per cent, while only 19 per cent of auctions were successful across Perth.

"Most agents - so the story goes - get into real estate because they love property and they love helping people. And the chance to earn a small fortune is pretty alluring too. 

But within just a few short months, they are destined to hate both houses and people - and be broke - burned out by psychotic vendors, ungrateful landlords, feral tenants and disgruntled buyers.

Why does it happen like this? What is it about real estate that brings out all the crazy people? And why does your agency seem to be the one that attracts them as clients?

A look at neurological and behavioural research provides some clues that indicate maybe it is not individual agents or offices that attract the unstable or unbalanced, but that the stress involved in buying and selling property is enough to make pretty much everyone feel unhinged.

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory argues that human psychological wellness is served by the meeting key needs. Until we feel secure at the base levels, we cannot move towards more enlightened behaviour. 


Shelter is one of our basic physiological needs according to Maslow. What does that mean for agents? It means that when humans feel their “shelter” is uncertain, they feel their very survival is threatened on a subconscious level and are in a constant state of anxiety. Property is a key part of the second layer of needs – part of our safety and security. When property is insecure, this makes us feel endangered and unsafe. 

Selling a property is to walk headlong into these feelings of anxiety and distress that often refuse to be reasoned away. But so too is the feeling triggered for buyers who can’t find a property, or tenants struggling in the search for something suitable to rent. 

Want to know why your vendor is shouting at you? Or a potential buyer just slammed down the phone on you during the negotiation? It’s not because they’re nuts. It’s because subconsciously, there’s a voice telling them “You’re not safe. You have no shelter. You’re in danger!” and that anxiety is affecting their behaviour in a way that can’t always be rationalised away.

This is because new research from neuroscientists at the University of Pittsburgh has identified that anxiety disrupts the decision-making regions of your brain which can make it physically impossible to think clearly in some highly stressful situations, which in turn is likely to affect your behaviour. 

The study found that anxiety affects your prefrontal cortex – the front part of your brain responsible for understanding rules, the consequences of risk, problem solving and decision making. In doing so, it also affects our ability to regulate our emotions and control behaviour. 

So when you’re in the middle of an auction, pushing a vendor to accept the highest offer, when you’re negotiating with buyers who’ve missed out on numerous other properties, when you’re asking someone who has lived in a home for 40 plus years who has been prevaricating to sign the sales agreement – these are all times when our stress responses are in full flight and in fact, our brains are actively incapable of making a good choice or monitoring our behaviour.

But it doesn’t have to be like this. There are things real estate agents can do that can alleviate the stress their customers feel which will in turn improve the behaviour they demonstrate toward you. These include:

1.    Let people know what to do in case of an emergency

Every time you get on an airplane, the crew runs through the safety demonstration. You’ve seen it a million times, but it is based on the fact that in the event of an emergency when your brain is flooded with cortisol and you literally can’t think, you’ll revert to something that has been drummed into you. 

It’s a great approach that more agents could take too – because while there’s no way of avoiding the fact that buying or selling a property is stressful, as a real estate agent with extensive experience, you’ve seen everything before – so share that knowledge with your clients. 

Research from University College London identifies that the unexpected is more stressful, than the expected, even if what’s expected is painful. So explain to your clients what the selling (or buying, or renting) process looks like, where things sometimes go wrong, and how you proactively solve those things when they occur. Make sure you know their auction instructions well in advance and ensure they’ve been planned for quietly and rationally, so you can remind them of that decision, not ask for a new one. Hope for the best but plan for the worst is the mantra. Make solving the stress in advance part of your procedure. 

This has a two-fold affect – it reassures people that what’s happening to them is normal and it tells them that you’ve got their back and they are in good hands which goes a long way to establishing a relationship based on trust.

2.    Help clients take a break from the stressors

What is the most stressful thing about the sale process that is upsetting your vendor? Is it having the property clean in time for each open house? Is it making sure the dog is out of the house? And are there ways that you could give your client a break, even just once – by offering to organise a cleaner, or a dog sitter? 

Research from the American Psychological Association identifies that taking a break from stressors can be hugely beneficial, even if it’s just short term. Even a small gesture such as a voucher for coffees and a snack at the local café during the open tells them that you are noticing their behaviour, have empathy for what they’re going through and you’re there to support them. (and you can meet them for a coffee afterwards and let them know how it went).

3.    Encourage mindfulness

Both Persian and Jewish philosophers are credited with the saying “This too shall pass” – so dealing with stressful situations has been going on for millennia. But rather than enduring, modern psychology has identified that being able to visualise what the end result both looks like and feels like in a positive way is hugely powerful to reducing stress.

Sometimes your clients may resist this – if they’re selling a long-loved family home, the idea of leaving may terrify them and increase feelings of sadness. But encourage them to visualise how exciting it will once the hammer has fallen on auction day and they know how much money is coming in, how lovely their new home is going to be, all the things they will be able to achieve as part of their new chapter. 
 
If you’ve outlined your process for selling (or buying) in detail and your clients know what to expect each step of the way, they’ll find it easier to imagine positive outcomes.

"With investor activity easing and attractive incentives becoming available in NSW and Vic, there has been a rebound in borrowing by first home buyers over the past year.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) housing finance data includes data on first home buyer housing finance commitments, specifically for owner occupiers.  Over recent years, first home buyer activity has generally been tracking below average, however, each state and territory offers some level of incentive to first home buyers including grants and tax concessions.  Over recent years, some states and territories have increasingly offered stamp duty reductions for buyers with these going live last year in NSW and Vic.  As a result of these incentives and a slowdown in investor demand, activity from the first home buyer segment has climbed over the past year.

The data is not seasonally adjusted so it does show seasonal effects, particularly early in the year.  Nationally, there were 8,782 housing finance commitments in February 2018.  Although the volume of loans was down on levels in late 2017, it was 33.1% higher than the previous February.  As a share of all owner occupier commitments, first home buyers accounted for 17.9% in February 2018 compared to 13.3% the previous year.

 

 

Across the individual states and territories different trends are emerging.  This is probably somewhat due to activity across other buyer types in the market and how recently certain incentives have become available.

NSW  

In February 2018 there were 2,246 first home buyer housing finance commitments compared to 1,105 the previous year which is an increase of 103.3%.  Since the end of June 2017, stamp duty concessions have become available and over the 8 months there have been 18,400 commitments compared to 10,857 over the previous 8 months.  First home buyers now account for 15.1% of owner occupier finance commitments up from 7.5% a year earlier.  The 15.1% is the greatest share since October 2012.

Vic  

There were 2,619 finance commitments to first home buyers in February 2018.  The number of commitments was 38.6% higher than a year earlier.  Vic also saw stamp duty exemptions go live on July 1 last year.  From the end of June there have been 23,996 first home buyer commitments compared to 17,522 over the previous 8 months.  First home buyers accounted for 18.3% of commitments compared to 13.9% a year earlier.

Qld  

Over the month there were 1,839 first home buyer housing finance commitments.  The number of commitments was only marginally higher from a year ago (+3.8%).  First home buyers have been much more active over recent years than in NSW and Vic although, it should be noted investors have been much less active in the Qld market.  First home buyers accounted for 19.3% of the market in February 2018 compared to 17.6% a year earlier. 

SA  

In February 2018 there were 443 first home buyer housing finance commitments.  Although the number was lower than those recorded late last year, it was 17.8% higher than the previous February.  Despite house values being the lowest of any mainland capital city, SA has the lowest share of first home buyer activity of any state or territory with 13.0% of owner occupier commitments going to first home buyers, a year ago they accounted for a 10.5% share so they have risen a little.

WA  

There were 1,185 first home buyer finance commitments in February 2018 which was -0.1% fewer than the volume in February 2017.  WA is the only state or territory in which there were fewer commitments to first home buyers than a year ago.  Despite the fall in volumes, first home buyers account for 25.0% of all owner occupier housing finance commitments compared to 22.2% a year ago.

Tas  

Over the month of February 2017 there were 137 first home buyer housing finance commitments which was 2.2% higher than the previous February.  As a share of all owner occupier housing finance commitments, first home buyers account for 13.9%, up marginally from 13.8% a year ago.  A common commentary is that a lot of younger people are moving to Tas to buy a home because they can’t afford one on the mainland.  Although the number of first home buyers rose over the year, they remain very low which suggests, at least at this stage, first home buyers in Tas are not particularly active.

NT  

While 52 first home buyer commitments in February 2018 is quite a low number, it is 26.8% higher than the previous year despite a sharp monthly fall.  As a share of all owner occupier commitments, first home buyers account for 19.4% compared to 14.7% a year earlier however, the share is currently trending lower. 

ACT  

The 261 first home buyer housing finance commitments in February 2018 was a 177.7% increase in the number from the previous year.  As a share of all owner occupier commitments, first home buyers accounted for 25.6% in February 2018 which was the highest share since October 2009.


The trends in first home buyer activity highlights the sensitivities of this important market segment to both affordability constraints as well as market incentives such as first home buyer grants and stamp duty concessions.

Despite broadly slowing conditions in Sydney and Melbourne, it’s clear from CoreLogic indices that the more affordable end of the housing markets in these cities are still seeing values rise, at least in annual terms – a likely demonstration of stronger demand from first home buyers.  In other cities where affordability constraints are less severe, in the absence of any changes to first home buyer incentives, first time buyers generally remain more active relative to Sydney and Melbourne.    

With demand from the investment segment expected to continue to be weaker than it has over recent years this may afford more opportunities for first home buyers to enter the market.  While this may be some long overdue good news for potential first home buyers, they should continue to exercise caution, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne where housing values peaked last year and affordability constraints are more severe relative to other cities.

After many years of strong value gains in Sydney and Melbourne values are declining at a time in which first home buyer activity is rising.  First home buyers that buy into a falling market may be entering into a negative equity position. 

Outside of the two largest cities, first home buyer volumes may lift over the coming months due to ongoing low mortgage rates and relative affordability compared to Sydney and Melbourne.  In fact, the outflow of people from NSW to other states and territories is continuing to rise which may result in increases in first home buyers elsewhere.

In comparison, 1,839 auctions were held last week and the final clearance rate came in at 62.8 per cent. Over the same week last year, auction volumes were significantly lower due to the Easter weekend with just 493 homes going under the hammer across the combined capital cities, although the clearance rate was a stronger 73.9 per cent. 

 

In Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 64.3 per cent was recorded across 874 auctions this week, down from 68.2 per cent across 723 auctions last week. Over the same week last year, 102 homes were taken to auction across the city, returning a clearance rate of 81.3 per cent.

"This week, CoreLogic is currently tracking 1,690 capital city auctions, decreasing from the 1,839 auctions held last week. While one year ago a significantly lower 493 auctions were held over what was the Easter period last year.

As usual, Melbourne and Sydney are the two busiest capital city auction markets this week, with 795 and 678 homes scheduled to go to auction; down from last week’s final result which saw 720 and 775 auctions held across the cities respectively.

Auction activity is expected to be lower week-on week across each of the smaller auction markets.

All of the busiest suburbs for auctions this week are in Victoria, with Richmond topping the list with 18 homes set to go under the hammer, followed by Mount Waverley with 14 scheduled auctions, while Craigieburn and Reservoir will each host 13 auctions.

Summary of last week's results


Final auction results for last week show that 1,839 residential homes were taken to auction with a 62.8 per cent final auction clearance rate, down from 64.8 per cent over the previous week when significantly fewer auctions were held (670).

Auction volumes rose across Melbourne last week returning a higher final clearance rate, with 723 auctions held and 68.2 per cent selling, increasing from the week prior when only 152 auctions were held and 65.5 per cent cleared.


There were a total of 795 Sydney auctions last week, increasing on the previous weeks 394 auctions. The higher volumes saw the final clearance rate weaken with 62.9 per cent of auctions successful, down on the 67.9 per cent the week prior.

All of the remaining auction markets saw a rise in activity last week; clearance rates however returned varied results week-on-week, with Adelaide Brisbane and Perth showing an improvement across the higher volumes while Canberra and Tasmania both recorded lower clearance rates.

Across the non-capital city regions, the highest clearance rate was recorded across the Hunter region, with 72.5 per cent of the 45 auctions successful.

The first chart shows the ratios of household and housing debt to household disposable income over time.  At the end of 2017, both ratios had increased to record high levels.  The ratio of household debt to disposable income was recorded at 188.6% and the ratio of housing debt to disposable income was 138.9%.  Over the past 12 months, the ratios have increased by 4.4% and 4.3% respectively.


While the ratio of household and housing debt to disposable income has risen to record highs, so has the ratio of household assets to disposable income.  The ratio of housing assets to disposable income is close to its record high.  As at December 2017, the ratio of household assets to disposable income was recorded at 961.5% and the ratio of housing assets to disposable income was recorded at 525.3%.  Both ratios rose over the quarter and were 4.2% and 4.1% higher respectively over the year.


Based on the ratios of household and housing debt to assets, the RBA data shows that the value of household and housing assets is substantially greater than the value of the debt.  At the end of 2017, these ratios were recorded at 19.6% for household debt to assets and 26.4% for housing debt to housing assets.  Each of these ratios was unchanged from the ratios as at December 2016.  It is important to recognize a few things about this data.  Firstly, it is a macro view so there are households in a significantly weaker position (marginal buyers, recent buyers and owners in markets where values have fallen substantially) as well as households in a much stronger position (households that have held their properties for many years).  Secondly, this data looks at all households so includes those that carry no housing debt which is estimated to be around 40% of all households.  Also note that in periods in which dwelling values have fallen (2008 and 2010-12) there have been some sharp rises recorded in these ratios.


Over recent years the value of household assets has been increasing at a more rapid rate than the value of debt.  Over the past year, there has been a deceleration in the increase in household assets while household debt has continued to expand at a fairly consistent pace.  With dwelling values now declining over the coming year(s) the value of debt may expand at a faster pace than the value of assets.


The lending market in Australia is currently evolving.  After very high levels of interest-only borrowing over recent years, recent quarters have seen substantially fewer new interest-only loans written and an increasing number of borrowers voluntarily switching to principal and interest.   This will mean that a higher proportion of borrowers are reducing their debt.  At the same time we have seen dwelling values begin to fall in major housing markets.  Although these falls to-date aren’t substantial, they will likely lead to a reduction in the value of housing assets.  At the same time, these value falls may result in fewer active buyers as they remain on the sidelines.  The result of both of these changes means that both household debt ratios and household asset ratios may see falls over the coming years.

"Article first published on AB+F.

The Sydney housing market has remained a contentious subject over the past 12 months, with 2017 recording its fair share of ups and downs – depending on your perspective of course, says CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless.

Despite the recent slide in dwelling values across the city, CoreLogic data shows property prices are still 69 per cent higher than they were when the market reached a low point in Feb 2012 and, although interest rates remain low, affordability is still a talking point. So how will the current landscape inform government policy, developer activity and consumer behavior in Sydney over the coming year?

Investors

Investors are still active in the market, with the latest ABS housing finance data showing they comprise 51 per cent of new mortgage demand; well above the long run average of 37 per cent. This is despite tougher serviceability criteria and mortgage rate premiums.

That said, the share of investor mortgages across New South Wales has fallen from their peak of almost 65 per cent in 2015, and we could possibly see this decline further in light of slow capital gains and low rental yields in Sydney as well as credit restraints on investment and interest only mortgages.

First homebuyers

On the other hand, first homebuyer activity, as a proportion of all owner occupier finance commitments, rose from 7.5 per cent in early 2017 to almost 15 per cent by the end of last year, indicating a rush from first time buyers to benefit from stamp duty concessions. But despite the increased activity, saving for a deposit is prohibitive for many and this cohort remains a small percentage of all buyers.

To combat this, ‘rentvesting’ – where you rent in your preferred area and buy somewhere more affordable - is likely to become more popular among younger buyers, as is staying at home for longer, or even moving interstate. This already growing trend for domestic migration out of NSW is set to continue as people consider how far their dollar will stretch outside of Sydney.

Rentvesting is likely to become more popular among younger buyers, as is staying at home for longer, or even moving interstate.

Government

In contrast, strong overseas migration rates into Sydney are fueling greater demand for housing. As such, we can expect housing supply to be a priority among government housing policies, including more affordable options.

Taking a long-term view, this is bound to have a greater impact on housing affordability challenges then initiatives such as stamp-duty concessions, which stimulate demand and are likely to simply drive values higher across the more affordable priced areas of the market.

It should be noted that while net overseas migration remains at very high levels, net interstate migration is seeing an increasing number of residents of New South Wales moving to other state and territories.

Developers

Apartment construction has grown to unprecedented levels in recent years, stimulated by demand from local investors and foreign buyers. As these groups are no longer buying at the levels they were, this should influence an easing in high rise unit construction across NSW – mirroring a trend that has been emerging in Victoria and Qld since late 2016.

Instead, we can expect to see developers shift away from high-rise construction towards medium density options, building town houses and terraces that meet the needs of families. Medium density housing stock located close to the city and along transport spines are currently under supplied and will be highly sought after.

While the cash rate isn’t likely to rise this year, mortgage rates could still push a little higher due to increased funding costs on capital markets.

Lenders

While the cash rate isn’t likely to rise this year, mortgage rates could still push a little higher due to increased funding costs on capital markets. Sydney homeowners with several years of property ownership under their belt may have built substantial equity in their home and be able to withstand interest rates moving higher. More recent buyers, particularly those with thinly stretched balance sheets, could find themselves at greater risk of mortgage stress.

However, it could be feasible for lenders to slightly relax their lending policies as APRA limits around credit growth and interest only lending have been comprehensively achieved. If lenders become more willing to lend for investment purposes, ensuring they remain within the regulatory benchmarks, it could help to ease the downward trajectory of Sydney home values.

While there have certainly been some positive outcomes for several players in the Sydney housing market over the past year, enduring challenges remain – particularly around affordability and supply. In a few decades time, this may be less of an issue with technology making it easier for people to live and work outside of the city. But in the short term, tackling these challenges has to remain a priority.

Published: 11 April 2018.",2021_04_23,11-Apr-18,NSW,Key Trends That Will Define The Sydney Housing Landscape In 2018
"CoreLogic’s stratified hedonic home value index shows the most expensive sector of the market is slowing rapidly as has been the case in other recent housing market slowdowns.

The stratified hedonic index measures the change in values across three broad value based segments of the housing market: the most affordable 25% of properties, the middle 50% of properties and the most expensive 25% of properties.  The Index provides valuable insight into how different segments of the market are performing.

Over the March 2018 quarter, national data shows that dwelling values were down by 0.5%, however digging below the surface reveals the modest fall in values was confined to the most expensive quarter of the market.  The most affordable properties increased in value by +0.7% compared to a +0.3% increase across the middle market and a -1.1% decline across the most expensive properties.  Over the past year, dwelling values within the least expensive quartile increased by +0.7%, middle 50% values were +2.7% higher and top 25% values were +0.1% higher.  With value growth slowing, the trends of the past are being repeated with the most expensive properties experiencing the most rapid slowdown in value growth.  During the growth phase, it was these same properties that were also recording the highest rate of capital gain.

Of course trends vary substantially across the country.

Sydney  

Over the past 12 months, the most expensive properties have recorded the largest value falls (-5.7%) followed by the middle market (-0.9%) and the most affordable market managed some moderate growth (+0.6%).

Regional NSW  

The trends were somewhat different outside of Sydney, with the strongest annual growth recorded in the middle 50% (+5.6%), followed by the low 25% (+4.1%) and top 25% (+3.7%).

Melbourne

Values have increased over the past year across each segment of the market, with the most moderate increases recorded across the most expensive segment (+1.6%), then the middle 50% (+6.2%) while the most affordable suburbs have recorded double-digit growth (+11.3%).

Regional Vic  

Outside of Melbourne, the most expensive suburbs have recorded the strongest value growth (+4.7%) followed by the middle suburbs (+3.2%) and finally the most affordable suburbs where values were +2.4% higher.

Brisbane  

Annual growth has been quite moderate however, the middle valued suburbs recorded the strongest growth (+1.1%) followed by fairly similar growth rates across the most affordable suburbs (+0.9%) and the most expensive suburbs (+0.8%).

Regional Qld  

The most expensive suburbs were the only ones in which values increased over the past year (+2.4%), with values lower over the middle (-0.8%) and affordable (-3.5%) market segments.

Adelaide

Each sector of the market recorded growth over the past year with the greatest increase across the middle market (+1.5%) with the affordable and expensive segments each recording growth of +0.8%.

Regional SA  

Values have declined across each market segment over the past year with the biggest falls across the most expensive suburbs (-4.2%) followed by the middle market

Perth  

Values have fallen over the past year across each market sector with the largest declines across the most affordable properties (-4.4%) followed by the middle market (-3.2%) with the most expensive properties recording the most moderate value falls (-2.4%).

Regional WA  

The most expensive regional properties have recorded the most moderate value falls over the past year (-3.8%) while the middle (-6.4%) and least expensive (-7.5%) market segments have experienced much greater value falls.

Hobart

The strongest performing market for value growth has recorded value increases across each segment, the greatest of which has occurred across the most affordable properties (+13.9%) followed by the middle market (+11.6%) and the most expensive market (+10.5%).

Regional Tas  

Values are climbing across each segment with the greatest annual growth recorded across the most affordable segment (+8.1%) followed by the middle market (+5.5%) and finally the most expensive properties (+2.7%).

Darwin  

The city has experience substantial value falls over the past year, the largest of which have occurred for the most expensive properties (-9.0%) followed by the middle market (-8.2%) and the most affordable suburbs (-6.8%).

Regional NT  

Values have increased over the past 12 months for the most affordable properties (+2.9%) while they have fallen across both the middle (-0.6%) and the most expensive properties (-0.7%).

Canberra  

The most affordable suburbs have recorded the slowest annual growth over the past year (+1.7%) followed by the most expensive properties (+1.9%) and the middle market (+2.6%).

The data highlights, that particularly within the housing markets which have recorded the strongest value growth over recent years (Sydney and Melbourne) that growth across the premium housing sector is slowing more rapidly than the other sectors.  This mirrors the experience in other recent housing market slowdowns/downturns whereby it is the most expensive suburbs which slow first and have experienced the larger downturns.

Hobart and regional Tasmania are seeing values grow at a rapid pace and it is interesting to note that the growth in the market is being led by more affordable properties with the relatively expensive housing lagging in terms of growth. 

In Perth and Darwin where the housing markets have been in a downturn for many years different trends are emerging.  Perth is showing more signs of a recovery than Darwin and it appears the improvement in Perth is being driven by premium housing.  By comparison, in Darwin where the market shows few signs of improvement the most expensive properties are showing the greatest weakness.

The headline figures tell a broad story about the housing markets performance while the stratified hedonic index highlights the importance of also taking a more micro look at the market.  The data shows that even within cities there are very different trends at play between the affordable and expensive properties which is important to understand.

"CoreLogic Head of Research Tim Lawless reviews the recent release of Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The SEIFA indices provides a summary of the areas around the country that are highly advantaged and disadvantaged in terms of their socio-economic profile.

The SEIFA index ranks the areas of Australia according to their relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage.  The ABS describes relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage as ‘people's access to material and social resources, and their ability to participate in society’.  In layman's terms, this simply means that areas of high advantage will typically show higher income levels, but also residents are likely to be more educated, have professional or highly skilled occupations, there will be less overcrowding in the homes, and more people are likely to have a higher education amongst other things.  

The indexes are constructed based on a series of variables that include income, education, employment, occupation, housing and other miscellaneous indicators such as the number of cars, proportion of ‘group’ households, proportion of dwellings with an internet connection and proportion of people who do or don’t speak English.    A  full description of the indexes can be found on the ABS web site here.  

It seems logical that most households would aspire to living in an area where socio-economic advantage is high, however in many cases, the buy in price for housing also tends to be extremely high in these areas.  The tables below provide a national summary of the areas where ‘advantage’ is the highest.  17 of the top 20 regions are located in Sydney, with 9 of these regions are located within the North Sydney/Hornsby area.

National Top 20 Most Advantaged Suburbs


Importantly, not all areas that are high on the socio-economic rankings are out of reach in terms of housing prices.  The tables below include suburbs ranked within the top decile for advantage (ie in the top ten percent of socio-economic advantage) sorted based on the lowest median house value.  While Sydney (1 suburb), Melbourne and Canberra (no suburbs) are largely absent from the top 20 list due to their higher price points, its clear that many suburbs of Perth (7 suburbs), Darwin, Hobart, Brisbane and Adelaide (all with three suburbs in the top 20) offer up a range of relatively affordable housing options in areas of high socio-economic advantage.

National Top 20: most affordable suburbs within the

The following tables provide an insight around the areas of highest and lowest advantage across each of the capital cities.  Additionally, for those seeking to live in areas that are within the top 10% of highly advantaged suburbs nationally, what are the more affordable entry points to the housing markets in these areas.

"CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless delivers refreshing insights for those looking to enter the regional property market where the unemployment rate is below 4%!

House prices have surged higher across the largest capital cities to levels that are often well out of reach for a growing number of households.  With housing affordability a real challenge, particularly for first home buyers, Australia’s regional areas are proving their worth.  According to Mr Lawless, the temptation to move further afield is likely to become a growing phenomenon.  

“For many people, considering a move involves much more than simply relocating – most will require secure employment and in a region that is proximate to a variety of amenity and essential services such as schools, health care and shopping facilities, particularly if they have a family, or are considering starting a family,” Mr Lawless said.

As shown below, the CoreLogic analysis identifies the regional towns where the unemployment rate is 4% or lower, and where the labour force is at least 10,000 people based on the local government area statistics.  (Note: The list is sorted in ascending order based on median house values in the area and is broad ranging, including agricultural regions, major service centers, regions linked to the mining sector and lifestyle markets).  

Towns where unemployment is less than 4%

(Excludes regions where the total labour force is less than 10,000 persons)

Topping the list is the NSW agricultural town of Wellington (about 45 minutes’ drive from Dubbo) where the median house value is just $212,221. The unemployment rate across the broader Western Plains council area, which includes Wellington, has reduced from a recent peak of 5.4% down to 2.2%.
 
Queensland’s Isaac region, which includes mining towns such as Moranbah, Dysart and Nebo, ranks second on the list with a median house value of $221,677.  The median house value across Isaac fell by 67% between October 2012 and February 2017, but has since increased by 12% through to the end of February this year.  The unemployment rate peaked at 3.2% in 2015 and has since reduced to just 1.8%.

Making it to third spot is Ashburton, located in the southern Pilbara region of north west Western Australia.  The area has strong links with the mining sector, with mining towns such as Tom Price and Paraburdoo.  As the mining downturn worsened, the median house value across Ashburton fell from a record high of $813,834 to $260,357 at the end of 2017; a peak to trough decline of 68%.  2018 has seen housing values start to recover and labour markets have tightened.

While Mr Lawless agrees that mining towns aren’t ‘everyone’s cup of tea’, he said, “There are plenty of other locations on the list of suburbs that offer a more appealing blend of strong labour markets as well as lifestyle factors.”  

Coastal markets such as Port Macquarie-Hastings, Tweed, Ballina and the Surf Coast offer up a rich blend of low unemployment, amenity and lifestyle however housing prices are higher.  The major service centers such as Dubbo and Orange have much lower housing price points while still offering up low unemployment.  

Mr Lawless said, “Prospective buyers considering a move away from the capital cities in search of more affordable housing options might be best renting first, just in case country living isn’t for them. 

“While housing prices are generally much higher in the capital cities relative to their regional counterparts, the diversity of amenity, social options and job opportunities can often be hard to match.""

"Across the combined capital cities, the preliminary auction clearance rate rose to 72.2 per cent, from 62.7 per cent the previous week. The number of homes taken to auction however, fell to just 634 across the capital city markets, with Sydney host to the majority of auctions (362). 


Preliminary results for Sydney show that 77.8 per cent of reported auctions (207) were successful, the strongest clearance rate for the city this year; however it is likely that this will revise down as further results are captured over the coming days.


In Melbourne, traditionally the country’s largest auction market, there were just 148 auctions held, with 93 results reported so far and a clearance rate of 69.9 per cent so it will be interesting to see what happens when the remaining results are obtained.

"Housing market conditions are likely to be moving further down the RBA’s list of priorities, considering the market is showing every sign of moving through a soft landing, with the pace of value decline easing over recent months.  The controlled slowdown in the housing sector is likely to be a welcome outcome from the RBA, who are more likely to be focussing on labour markets, where the rate of unemployment, although lower than a year ago, crept higher, from 5.4% to 5.5% in February.  With some slack in labour markets, wages growth remains close to record lows, which is keeping a lid on inflation and household consumption.  National dwelling values were flat last month, however six of the eight capital cities saw dwelling values slip lower in March, albeit at a reduced rate of decline relative to other months.  

Despite the hold decision from the RBA, mortgage rates remain close to historic lows, particularly for owner occupiers who are paying down both their interest and principal.  Investors are facing a mortgage rate premium of around 60 basis points, but relative to long term averages, their mortgage rates are low.  While the RBA has flagged the next move in interest rates will be a rise, it remains likely that any hike to the cash rate is well in the future.

"Content marketing is the new marketing. It generates three times as many leads as other outbound marketing and has conversion rates that are six times higher according to experts. 

But what does that mean for real estate agents, how does it compare to traditional marketing behaviour and what needs to change?

According to the Content Marketing Institute, content marketing is a strategic marketing approach that is focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant and consistent content. Instead of boasting about yourself and your services, a content marketing approach provides truly relevant and useful information to prospects and customers to help them solve their issues.

In real estate, a content marketing approach is a key part of changing your mindset to becoming an attraction agent. Instead of boasting about your past performance, properties you’ve sold and your skills as a negotiator, its about putting yourself into the minds of a potential customer and asking yourself “What do my clients need to know before they sell their home, that will help them feel more informed and confident about that decision?” 

Content market places sharing information above shouting self promotional slogans. It can and should change how you advertise yourself, do mail-box drops and drive what you post on social media and the information you put onto your website. 

Taking an information-led approach has five other major benefits:

1.    Content makes you a subject authority

Why should people hire you as a real estate agent? Not because you’ll sell their property – that’s a given. They hire you because they believe that you have the skills and expertise to get the highest price based on your market knowledge and insights and the experience that will protect them from the scariest elements of selling. 

So share that expertise! Sharing reports and insights about property market performance – median prices, recent sales results, rents and yields – is a great way to demonstrate your knowledge. Providing advice on how you’ve helped past clients avoid the pitfalls of selling helps people trust you and positions you as a subject authority.

2.    Content creates awareness

Every single week in my suburb, every single agent sticks a DL flyer in my letterbox talking about a property that is either on the market or that they’ve sold (but not with anything useful on it like a price explaining how much it sold for – they just big note their listing). 

The awareness I’m left with is “I’m a real estate agent and I sell property”. My response? Big deal – because every single agent does the same thing. 

But when you start having a different conversation – about property prices, about past people you’ve helped, about how the market is performing, about ways to reduce stress when selling – you immediately stand out. And the awareness you create is “this agent is different. This agent is here to help me, not sell to me”.

3.    Search engines love content

If the only content on your website is property listings, your site will be relegated behind the major portals of realestate.com.au and domain.com.au because those sites have better audience and links, even at a local level.

But start posting unique content about your local area, property prices in your area, the people and events that make the area unique, and the combination of regular new content and content that is different will make you stand out to the search engines without the need to spend considerably on search engine marketing.

4.    Content encourages engagement

When people read an article, a property report, or see your latest listings, they often have additional questions. This is great – don’t see it as an annoying imposition. 

They want to know more. Helping them learn more, assisting them with their inquiry is to put yourself at their service, and gives you even more opportunities to both engage with them and demonstrate how you are different to other agents in your area. 

5.    Content improves prospect quality

What would you prefer – pitching to a potential client who knows nothing about you and your service, is dubious and needs you to start from scratch? Or pitching to a potential client who has read a lot of information about you, knows your approach to selling, has researched the market based on the information you’ve provided, and is really just having a personal interview to confirm the decision they want to make – that you’ll be their agent?

When you take a content marketing approach and make your goal to provide helpful and useful information and case studies on past people you have helped, you are in effect ‘warming up’ your leads. We know that buyers and sellers would prefer not to deal with an agent until they absolutely have to. 

Taking a content-led approach means potential clients find out a wealth of useful information about you and how you do business that both reassures and assists them that makes picking up the phone and setting the appointment that much easier.

"Given the upcoming Easter long weekend, auction volumes are much lower this week with only 540 capital city auctions scheduled; significantly lower than last week when 3,990 auctions were held across the combined capital cities. 

Almost 60 per cent of all capital city auction activity is scheduled to take place in Sydney this week (319 auctions), while in Melbourne, just 115 auctions will be held. 

Just over 100 auctions are scheduled to take place across the remaining capital cities, with 51 of those scheduled to take place in Brisbane and 29 in Adelaide. Canberra is set to host 19 auctions this week, while Perth is expecting just 7 auctions. 

There are currently no scheduled auctions in Tasmania this week.

This week, Sydney has more auctions scheduled than any other capital city market, so it is not surprising that the busiest individual suburbs for auctions are all located within the city. Woollahra (11), Bondi Beach (10), Rose Bay (9), Bondi (8) and Mosman (8) will host the highest volume of auctions. 

Summary of lats week's results


Last week saw auction volumes break a new record with 3,990 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities in the lead up to Easter, exceeding the previous high of 3,908 over the week ending 30th November 2014. The final auction clearance rate fell to 62.7 per cent last week, down from 66.0 per cent across 3,136 auctions the previous week. Over the same week last year, 3,171 auctions were held, returning a significantly stronger clearance rate (74.5 per cent).

Melbourne’s clearance rate last week was 65.8 per cent across 2,071 auctions, making it the busiest week on record for the city. In comparison, there were 1,653 auctions held across the city over the previous week, returning a clearance rate of 68.7 per cent. This time last year, 1,607 homes were taken to auction, and a clearance rate of 78.9 per cent was recorded. Sydney was host to 1,383 auctions last week, the most auctions held across the city since the week leading up to Easter 2017 (1,436), while over the previous week, 1,093 auctions were held. The clearance rate for Sydney fell to 61.1 per cent, down from 64.8 per cent over the previous week, while this time last year, Sydney’s clearance rate was a stronger 75.8 per cent. 

Across the smaller auction markets, auction volumes increased week-on-week, however looking at clearance rates, Adelaide (64.6 per cent) and Canberra (69.1 per cent) were the only cities to see a slight rise in the clearance rate over the week. 

The Gold Coast region was the busiest non-capital city region last week with 87 homes taken to auction, while Geelong recorded the highest clearance rate at 79.7 per cent across 75 auctions.

"CoreLogic is currently tracking 3,689 capital city auctions this week, which is set to be the busiest week for auctions so far this year.  The increase in activity is what is traditionally seen over the week prior to Easter, however it is expected that the number of homes scheduled for auction this week will be higher than final figures from the pre-Easter week last year when a total of 3,517 auctions were held across the capital cities.

Looking at activity across the individual cities, Melbourne is expected to see a record number of auctions held this week, with 1,934 Melbourne homes scheduled to go under the hammer. This is not only set to be the highest number of auctions this year, but the second busiest week on record ever for the city, with the possibility of surpassing the busiest week recorded (29th October 2017- 1,983 auctions) with volumes usually revising upward as final results are collected.

Across Sydney, there are 1,255 homes scheduled to go to auction this week, increasing from the 1,093 held last week, however lower than the 1,436 auctions held over the pre-Easter week last year. 

Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth are all set to see a higher volume of auctions week-on-week and also higher than the pre-Easter week last year. 

Tasmania is the only auction market where there are fewer scheduled auctions this week compared to last week.

 

Reservoir in Victoria is the busiest individual suburb for auctions across the nation this week, with 39 residential homes scheduled for auction. Followed by Richmond (Vic) with 31, and Randwick in NSW with 26 scheduled auctions.

The final auction clearance rate across the combined capital cities rose to 66 per cent across a total of 3,136 auctions last week; making it the second busiest week for auctions this year. Over the week prior, a 63.3 per cent final clearance rate was recorded across a significantly lower volume of auctions (1,764). In comparison to one year ago, the clearance rate was a higher 74.1 per cent, while the number of auctions held were a lower 2,916. 

 

Last week, Melbourne recorded its busiest week for auctions so far this year with a total of 1,653 homes taken to auction.  The final auction clearance rate across the city fell to 68.7 per cent, down from the 70.8 per cent over the week prior when a much lower 453 auctions were held.  

In Sydney, the final auction clearance rate increased to 64.8 per cent last week, from 62.2 per cent the week prior. The higher week-on-week clearance rate was across a higher volume of auctions, with 1,093 auctions held up from the 974 the previous week.

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates improved in Brisbane, Perth and Tasmania, while Adelaide and Canberra both returned a lower success rate over the week.

Geelong was the best performing non-capital city region last week, with 86.1 per cent of the 56 auctions successful. However, the Gold Coast region was host to the highest number of auctions (60).

"What makes big data big? And why is this idea of ‘big data’ more valuable than the data which is sitting inside the database of an ordinary real estate agent? 

Here are the nine things that determine how valuable your data is – or isn’t – ranked from lowest in value to highest.

1.    Static Data 

Most agents have static data – information that is keyed into a system at a particular time and which may never again be updated. Static data is helpful – it’s a record of what you’ve done or who you know and what happened which can help you see patterns of the past. But it’s just the start of the big data adventure. 

2.    The source of your data

How was your data sourced? Most agents collect their own data at open for inspections and cold calling. They add this to sources of data such as the data within RP Data Professional. The value of ‘source’ is based on the integrity of the collector. If you know that the person or organisation collecting the data has high standards of accuracy, the source of your data can be an asset that is important to its value. But if your source is a bunch of agents who are only typing names into the database because they have to, the ‘source’ may be a liability.

3.    Cleanliness

Cleanliness is next to godliness in databases, and like housework, requires constant vigilance and maintenance. If Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are listed as potential buyers in your CRM, you know you have a problem. Identify key data points that must exist in your database (such as full name, address, mobile and email) and make these your minimums. Then, set aside CRM housecleaning so that records that don’t have these minimums are contacted and either corrected or culled.

4.    Size

While obviously, big data requires scale, bigger is not necessarily better in a local real estate agents database, if that size comes at the cost of the first three criteria. A big database that is dirty, inconsistent and lost in time is not as valuable as a small, well maintained and sourced set. Get the first three right though, and adding size does add to the value.

5.    Age

Did you know that data is like milk and has a use-by date? Leave data too late, and it goes off, the information becomes too dated to be valuable. Being able to have your data in a state that allows it to be accessed and used quickly can be more valuable in some circumstances than having a dataset that is perfect but outdated.

6.    Insights

What kind of insights does your data hold? What are the similarities between your customers and how they transacted? What are their ages, life stages, expectations? How long is it taking them to move through a property cycle? What does a typical buying or selling cycle look like? How is your business accommodating these similarities and differences?

Many people shy away from ‘examining’ data thinking you need a tertiary degree, but sometimes, just making time to look through your data on a regular basis and asking yourself “what’s it showing me?” or even “what’s changed?” can provide you with valuable insights. 

7.    Actionable

Insights however, are only truly valuable if you know what to do with them. So a database that helps you both see the insights, and then helps you follow up those insights with action has a higher value. 

What constitutes an actionable insight? One where you see that time on market is starting to rise, which enables you to double down on selling the value of marketing campaigns to vendors. Or one where you notice that you’re attracting more women in their 30s as open for inspection attendees whenever you promote a property on Facebook, and so decide to increase your Facebook promotions and improve their wording and targeting. 

8.    Timeliness

We saw before that data can be static and dated and still have some value. Timeliness is the complete opposite – data that is not only fluid and fresh, but accurate, clean, significant in size, insightful, sourced legitimately and enabling of actions that allow you to respond and make decisions quickly. 

Significant computing power and analytical smarts are required to create timely data, but the rewards are dramatic. In stockmarkets, computer algorithms crunch share information to allow trades to occur tenths of a second faster than competitors, such is the value of the arbitrage. Real estate data is heading in a similar direction but has a long way to go.

9.    Predictive

Once your data has passed the timeliness benchmark, the final value layer is its ability to be predictive. 

When you know everything there is to know about your past customers, what they look like, how they behave, typical transactions and what their value is, there are two significant things you can do with it. 

First, by seeing how past customers have behaved under certain circumstances, you can start to apply that knowledge to new customers, pre-empt problems and deliver a better standard of service. 

Secondly, you can apply your customer insights to the rest of the known data universe to identify people who look exactly like them with whom you have not yet done business. Facebook call this ‘look alike audiences’ but Facebook is not the only way to find lookalikes. 

In this way, if you know that your ideal past vendors were 30-something women with two kids in a three bedroom house, you can target other women in their 30s with kids to become your next set of vendors.

"With high transactions costs and affordability challenges in some markets, transaction numbers have been trending lower since 2015 resulting in lower turnover of housing stock.  This week we take a look at the suburbs in each state and territory that have recorded the highest and lowest turnover over the past year.

Housing turnover is measured by comparing the number of sales over a period (12 months) to the total number of dwellings.  Based on this data the proportion of the total housing stock that sold over a period can be calculated.

The analysis within this report calculates turnover percentages for those suburbs which have at least 1,000 dwellings within them.  Nationally, housing turnover has been gradually trending lower, from a recent high of 6.5% back in 2009 to just 4.8% over the twelve months ending February 2018.  Lower turnover is likely attributable to several factors including high transactional costs (think stamp duty, raising a deposit, building and pest inspections etc) as well as affordability constraints and disincentives for mature aged home owners to downsize.

While the results are diverse, the suburbs with the highest turnover tend to be located in more affordable areas synonymous with first home buyers and often located around the outer fringes of the capital city metro areas. These areas are often a starting point for families entering the market with an eventual view to upgrading the family home over time.  The suburb with the highest proportion of stock turn-over throughout the past 12 months was Spring Farm, located in Sydney’s Macarthur region.  Spring Farm saw 12.0% of its total housing stock sell over the past year.  

Suburbs with the highest levels of turnover,
12 months to February 2018

New South Wales

4 of the 5 suburbs with the highest turnover are located in Sydney.  All of these suburbs are on the outskirts of the city and are seeing high levels of new housing development.  Casuarina on the Tweed Coast is a lifestyle market which has a mix of houses and units.

Victoria

The top 5 suburbs for housing turnover are distributed across Greater Melbourne.  They are all located on the outskirts of the city and are affordable new housing estate areas seeing high levels of new housing development.

Queensland

3 of the 5 suburbs are situated in Brisbane with the other 2 located on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.  Each of these suburbs can be characterized as areas seeing high levels of new housing supply.  Newstead is somewhat different to the others because its new housing supply is coming in the form of units rather than houses.

South Australia

Each of the 5 suburbs with highest turnover are in Adelaide.  Unlike the other capital cities, the list is dominated by areas with largely established housing stock rather than an influx of new stock.

Western Australia

4 of the 5 suburbs are located in Perth and 3 of the 4 Perth suburbs are locations where heightened levels of new housing construction is occurring. South Hedland is a mining region of north-west WA and is seeing quite high turnover albeit most of that turnover is at prices that are well below the peak.

Tasmania

4 of the 5 suburbs are situated in Hobart with Huonville just outside of the capital.  Hobart is not seeing a lot of new development so the suburbs with higher turnover are outer suburbs of the city with larger lot sizes and lower prices.

Northern Territory

3 of the 5 suburbs with the highest turnover are outside of Darwin.  Fannie Bay is a well-established suburb while Durack is a relatively new development area.  The remaining 3 suburbs are all located in Alice Springs.

Australian Capital Territory

Coombs, Casey and Bonner are all outer suburbs of Canberra that have seen high levels of new housing development in recent years.  Pearce and Dickson are more established housing markets, Dickson in particular is seeing more housing density enter the local market.

Looking at the suburbs nationally with the lowest share of housing stock sold over the past year, the list is a mixture of capital city suburbs and regional areas, with a large representation from regional areas associated with the mining sector where housing demand has been impacted by low demand.  Dandenong South in Melbourne had the lowest turnover in the nation with just 0.4% of total housing stock transacting over the year.

Suburbs with the lowest levels of turnover,
12 months to February 2018

New South Wales

3 of the 5 suburbs with the lowest turnover in NSW were in Sydney with the regional town of Kempsey and North Arm Cove north of Newcastle also making the list.  Interestingly the suburb of Sydney is on the list indicating very low turnover of units over the year.

Victoria

3 of the 5 suburbs with the lowest turnover are in Melbourne with the large regional cities of Ballarat and Bendigo also making the list.  Brunswick East is relatively close to the city centre while the other 2 Melbourne suburbs are on the outskirts of the city.

Queensland

Each of the suburbs with the lowest turnover are outside of Brisbane and outside of the south-east corner of the state.  Kin Kora in Gladstone is the only suburb listed in a large population area with the other suburbs in agricultural or mining regions where turnover has likely been impacted by low demand due to sharply falling prices.

South Australia

4 of the 5 suburbs listed are located in Whyalla, a town closely linked with the resources sector where market conditions have been challenging. Wallaroo is a lifestyle suburb located on the Copper Coast of SA.

Western Australia

Only 1 of the 5 suburbs listed is located in Perth.  Tom Price and Derby are suburbs linked to the resources sector where housing demand has been impacted by sluggish labour markets and falling housing prices.  Lancelin is described as a fishing village north of Perth and Merredin is an agricultural town.

Tasmania

3 of the 5 suburbs are located in Hobart and all 3 are located close to the city centre.  Norwood is a suburb of Launceston while Smithton is a coastal lifestyle market.

Northern Territory

All of the 5 suburbs listed are located in Darwin.  3 of the 5 suburbs are located within the Darwin council area with the remaining two in the Palmerston region of the city.

Australian Capital Territory

3 of the 5 suburbs listed are located within the Belconnen district and are well established suburbs.  The remaining 2 (Ainslie and City) are in the city centre.

Despite the population growing rapidly and a near record high number of properties under construction, turnover is generally expected to remain low.  In fact, turnover nationally may fall even further given that a number of cities are now seeing values decline and credit conditions are generally tighter.

"Changes to migration policy would dampen housing demand, likely impacting the New South Wales housing market more than others.

The latest population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics was released recently, which showed the national population is rapidly approaching the 25 million mark, with 395,613 more people residing in Australia over the twelve months to September 2017. 

From a housing market perspective, population growth can be regarded as a proxy for housing demand – more people means a larger requirement for dwellings.  With this in mind, its interesting to note that the states where population growth is tracking substantially faster than the long term average (Victoria, New South Wales, ACT and Tasmania) are generally the same markets where dwelling values have risen the most over recent years, while the alternative is also true:  areas with lower than average population growth have shown weaker conditions.

Overseas migration comprised the largest component of population growth in Australia, at least at a national level.  Over the twelve months to September 2017, net overseas migration accounted for 63.2% of Australia’s population growth, with the remaining 37% coming from natural increase (ie births minus deaths). Early 2008 through to late 2009 was the last period where net overseas migration made up such a high concentration of population growth, a period when the world economy had weakened in response to the Global Financial Crisis while Australia’s economy remained reasonably buoyant thanks to the commodities boom.

Most of these overseas migrants are arriving in two states:  New South Wales (39.5%) and Victoria (35.4%).  There has never been a period historically, at least as far back as June ‘81, which is when the ABS demographic series commences, when overseas migration has been so concentrated within two of Australia’s states.

Outside of the broad ranging debate about whether a ‘big Australia’ is a positive or negative thing, the fact that overseas migration is so concentrated within two states potentially poses some housing market risk should overseas migration slowdown.   This risk is particularly relevant to New South Wales, where the other components of population growth, interstate migration and the rate of natural increase have been weak. 

Overseas migration comprised 80% of New South Wales population growth over the twelve months to September 2017, while natural increase accounted for 33% of growth and interstate migration was a drain of 13% on the states population.

If the flow of overseas migrants into New South Wales were to slow, which is a possibility if migration policies were changed, we could expect housing demand to slacken, especially considering the interstate migration outflow is gathering some pace and the rate of natural increase is tracking about 8% below the 30 year average across New South Wales.

Most other states are showing a more even split between the three components of population growth which should help to support broad based demand for housing.

Although a date for the next federal election hasn’t yet been set, the population debate is likely to be a main feature of political platforms.  While strong population growth helps to support economic growth, it also creates additional housing demand, more competition across labour markets, higher usage of transport systems and places additional pressure on essential services such as schools and health care.

If we were to see migration policies tightened, its likely both the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets would see a reduction in demand for both buying and renting dwellings.  Considering interstate migration is such as large component of overall population growth in Victoria, the Melbourne market would be less affected by lower overseas migration rates.

"This week we look at the suburbs across the capital cities in which houses and units which had the shortest median days on market throughout 2017.

The median days on market figure is calculated by comparing the date at which a property is first listed for sale to the date a contract is signed.  It is important to note that this data excludes auctions and only includes properties that have been sold by private treaty.

Hobart which has been the strongest market conditions over the past year in terms of value growth has also recorded the suburb (Mornington) with the shortest days on market for house sales in the country.  In fact, the five suburbs with the shortest days on market for houses in Hobart have a shorter time on market than the fastest selling suburbs in each other capital city.

Fastest selling capital city suburbs, houses
12 months to December 2017

In Sydney and Melbourne, the suburbs that have recorded the lowest days on market figures for houses are generally located on the outskirts of the city and they all have median house values which are lower than the city-wide medians.  This is reflective of much stronger demand, particularly over the second half of the year, for lower valued housing in both of these cities.

In Brisbane, the fastest selling suburbs are typically reasonably close to the city centre with values only slightly higher than the city-wide median.

Unlike Sydney and Melbourne, affordability is less challenging in Brisbane and there hasn’t been any recent policy changes for first home buyers which have boosted demand at the more affordable end of the pricing range.

Adelaide suburbs listed are typically quite close to the city centre with three of the five having median values well above the city-wide median with the remaining two suburbs (Saint Marys and Park Holme) slightly above the median.  Similar to Brisbane, affordability is less challenging in Adelaide relative to the larger cities and buyers are likely to be viewing inner city areas offering good value.

In Perth, one of the five suburbs listed has a median value below the city-wide median (Heathridge) while the other four suburbs are relatively closer to the city centre and have higher values.  Housing demand has been weak across Perth since 2014, but more recently sales volumes have been improving after values have fallen by around 12% since their peak.  

The fastest selling homes in Darwin have a longer days on market figure compared to the other capital cities; a reflection of the tough selling conditions and soft ousing demand.  These suburbs are all located relatively close to the city centre and all have median values above the city-wide median.

In Canberra, the fastest selling suburbs are generally located around the suburban fringe.  Charnwood and Holt have median house values which are below the city-wide median, although not substantially so.  Hackett is the only suburb not within the Belconnen District of the city.

For units, Taylors Hill in Melbourne and Bellerive and Montrose, both of which are in Hobart, have the shortest days on market at just 8 days.

In Sydney, the fastest selling suburbs for units are quite mixed, however each of the suburbs are located outside of the inner suburbs.  Cherrybrook and Russell Lea have median values higher than the Sydney median.  Panania is slightly below the city-wide median while the cost of units in North Gosford and Ourimbah on the Central Coast is significantly lower than the city-wide median. 

The five fastest selling suburbs for units in Melbourne are all located in outer areas of the city.  The five suburbs also have median unit values which are substantially lower than the median for Greater Melbourne, suggesting buyers are seeking out more affordable housing options.

Fastest selling capital city suburbs, units,
12 months to December 2017

Brisbane’s suburbs with the shortest days on market for units are all located within the Brisbane council area and they all have a median value under $400,000; only Wishart and Windsor have a median value which is higher than the Greater Brisbane median.

Four of the five fastest selling unit markets have a median value which is higher than the Greater Adelaide median, suggesting demand is strong at the higher priced end of the market.  Each of the five suburbs are located within close proximity to the city centre.

Four of the five suburbs with the fewest days on markets for units in Perth have median values which were well above the Greater Perth median.  In fact, a number of the suburbs are amongst some of the most expensive unit markets in the city sitting within some of the most prestigious suburbs.

Sandy Bay was the only suburb to make the list of fastest selling unit markets in Hobart with a median value above the city-wide median.  Montrose is the only suburb which is not particularly close to the city centre.

Units are typically taking much longer to sell in Darwin than they are elsewhere.  All of the fastest selling markets are reasonably close to the city centre.

Across Canberra, three of the five fastest selling unit markets are located within the Gungahlin district.  Meanwhile, Amaroo and Page are the only suburbs that have higher median unit values than the Canberra median.

"The CoreLogic total returns index measures the change in values and the rental return to determine the total gross returns from residential property.  The total returns index is valuable for investors as it shows the expectation of returns much like the ASX 200 Accumulation Index provides insights into the total returns (ie change in the overall stock value plus dividend value) for equities investors.

 
The CoreLogic total returns index is available from the middle of 2005, looking at the change in the index over the 12 years to February 2018, the returns from capital city properties has been substantially higher (196.2%) than the returns across the combined regional markets (136.0%).  It should be noted that over that period, value growth was substantially higher across the capital cities than it was for regional markets with values increasing by 83.7% and 29.0% respectively.  At the same time, gross rental yields have been substantially higher across the regional areas than they have been in the capital cities.

While over the long-term the total returns have been much greater in the capital city markets than regional areas, the story has changed substantially over recent times.

With already higher rental returns in regional markets, the regional markets are now also experiencing higher rates of value growth than those in the capital cities.

 
Over the three months to February 2018, the total returns from residential property nationally were 0.0%. While the national figure shows flat returns there is a significant difference between returns across the combined regional markets (+2.0%) and combined capital cities -0.4%).  Taking a look at each individual capital city and the corresponding rest of state area in each state and territory, the rest of state markets have recorded stronger total returns over the quarter than the capital cities. In NSW, Vic and NT in particular, the spread between capital city and regional market returns is significant.

 
Although the stronger housing market performance in regional markets may seem like a recent occurrence, looking at total returns, the regional areas have been outperforming capital cities for more than a year.  This is due to higher rental yields and improving rates of value growth.  Over the past 12 months, total returns were recorded at 5.9% however, returns for regional properties (8.1%) were superior to those in capital cities.  Across the states and territories, Melbourne Adelaide and Hobart were the only capital cities in which total returns were superior in the capital city than in the rest of state areas and Hobart was the only city where the difference was substantial.  In NSW, returns from regional properties were almost double those in capital cities.

With capital growth prospects likely to be softer over the coming years, investors in residential property may need to be more focussed on total returns (a combination of value growth and capital growth) rather than just capital growth.  Regional markets, especially those relatively close to capital cities are currently experiencing relatively strong value growth and superior yields to the capital cities.  For this reason, investment in these regions may in fact be a better option over the coming few years than investment in capital city properties.  

One important thing to note is that the rental yield component is a gross figure and assumes the property is occupied for 52 weeks of the year.  Of course that won’t be the case for all properties and particularly if you are going to invest for total returns you need to choose properties that are highly desirable to ensure that you have the best opportunity to have it occupied throughout the year.

"Impatience, frustration, a fear of the unknown and a refusal to wait are the human behaviours that are now speeding up changes in real estate and there is big money behind it, according to real estate futurist, Brad Inman.

Inman - whose INMAN Connect conferences held each year in both San Francisco and New York are the largest in the world and have made a name for intersecting property and technology – was in Australia for the first time. He visited the CoreLogic Sydney offices to take part in a real estate roundtable with some of the industry’s top executives and thought leaders. 

But he said the industry’s ongoing obsession with the technology and how fast it was changing, was the focusing on the wrong thing; instead, agents should consider what the current pain points are in buying, selling and leasing real estate, and then embrace the technology that resolves them and makes it easier to deliver great service.  

We’ve summarised the key insights from his visit.

Fast and furious - Wall St versus Main St

Wall St played a significant role in the sub-prime mortgage crisis with leverage levels thrusting the US economy into recession. Undeterred, and in typical Wall St style, they then took advantage of collapsing real estate prices to buy up property as part of spreading their portfolio risk.

“But when they did that, they found out what a long and convoluted process buying real estate can be,” Inman said. “So they got a bunch of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and they’ve been throwing money at fixing that process ever since.”

The outcome are well-funded venture capital funds actively identifying ways to speed up buying and selling property, and make it easier and less stressful for all customers. 

“Wall St wants is not interested in a process that takes months – they want to transact with the click of a button, instantaneously and they are very invested in achieving that,” Inman said. “So unless you can out-fund Wall St, you need to stop fighting it and work out how to embrace it and the way to do that is put yourself in the mindset of the consumer.”

Examples of this include the rise of iBuyers that are now offering to buy property upfront, depositing the cash into your bank account within just a few days and allowing you to rent the property back until you find somewhere new.

“Now, sure, there may be criticisms that the price paid for that property might be lower than what the seller would get if they put it on the market, but think about the benefits,” Inman said.

“You don’t have to go through the process of selling – which can literally take months. You don’t have to pay for marketing, or have people tramping through your home for open for inspections, or deal with the legals and finance. You just get the money and you move on. That is very appealing for some people.”

Big data says you are who you say you are

Authentication of your identity is a major trend now driving change in real estate, Inman said, allowing more convenience to both consumers and agents, peace of mind, and flexibility. 

“In the US, open viewings are typically for four hours on a Sunday and during that time, a whole bunch of strangers tramp through your house and look through your stuff,” he said. 

“It’s inconvenient to consumers, it’s scary for home owners and it’s risky for realtors because we’ve even had realtors murdered.”

But biometric authentication dramatically changes that because by supplying passport or authorised ID and having it checked against criminal records and matched with your finger print or even eye scan, means potential buyers are known quantities. 

Inman said companies such as Trust Stamp and Clear are now conducting this kind of information assembling, allowing authenticated individuals the option to inspect a property whenever they want (even without an agent present) through finger print coded locks. (check out OpenDoor).

The end result could speed up the back end transaction, especially if identity checks are married with credit information. And team this change up with paperless transactions and digital signatures and key pain points in so many property transactions start to dissolve quickly.

“We need to get rid of filing cabinets,” Inman said.

Technology is changing the expectations of agents about their franchises

With technology making life significantly easier and frictionless for consumers, agents themselves are now expecting the tech they use will make their lives easier. This is a significant challenge for franchise groups with legacy technology and is calling into question the old franchise model. 

“Agents are now personally benefiting from technology more than ever before, as it’s allowing them to deliver better quality service to more people when it’s done right,” Inman said.

“The realtor groups that are trying to force their people to stick to old models of doing things are struggling and that is raising the questions of how should franchise groups define themselves. Are they technology companies? Are they listing businesses? What is the value that the franchise groups bring to their agents? No one has the answer, but it’s a hell of a question.”

Inman said that the technological disruption was being paired with a behavioural disruption, encouraged by a new generation of agents coming into the picture – Millennials.

“Leadership has always been from the bottom up and what we see in real estate is that top down models are now being displaced by a generation of people who are used to working in teams,” Inman said.

“Millennials like experts, they like teams, they like to collaborate, but they want to use expertise. So in real estate, they like using an agent because they value expertise, but as realtors, they expect a certain fearlessness from their leaders.”

Inman said a major study that Inman Connect has just completed identified that realtors want their leaders to confront disruption, be more responsive and take a position on issues of importance.  

“We need to change the leadership equation,” he said. “The job of a leader is to serve – that’s something that many of today’s leaders find a challenge. As an industry, we are wrestling with a new paradigm for leadership – one that is about embracing innovation, not fighting it.”

"Auction activity is expect to be somewhat sedate this week, with a total of 1,526 homes scheduled for auction across the combined capital cities, down 50 per cent on last week’s final results which saw a total of 3,026 auctions held.  

The lower activity expected this week is a likely result of half of the auction markets welcoming a long weekend, with Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide and Tasmania all host to a public holiday this coming Monday.

The most notable decrease in activity is expected to be across Melbourne, with only 375 homes scheduled for auction this week, down on last week’s 1,524 auctions held. 

The number of auctions scheduled across Sydney will also see a fall to a lesser degree, with 847 scheduled auctions this week, decreasing from the 1,044 auctions held last week.

Perth is expected to be the only capital city auction market to see a rise in volumes week-on-week.

Overall volumes this week are set to be higher than results from over the corresponding week last year, when 1,473 auctions were held.

Craigieburn in Victoria is the busiest suburb for auctions across the nation this week, with 18 homes scheduled to go under the hammer, followed closely by St Ives and Paddington, both of which are in NSW with 14 and 11 auctions to be held respectively.

Summary of last week's results

Last week, the combined capital cities returned a 63.6 per cent final auction clearance rate across 3,026 auctions, down from the 66.8 per cent across 3,313 auctions the week prior.  One year ago, volumes were lower with a total of 2,907 auctions held over the corresponding week, however the clearance rate last year was a significantly higher 74.6 per cent.


Melbourne returned a final auction clearance rate of 66.5 per cent across 1,524 auctions last week, down from the 70.6 per cent over the week prior when 1,606 auctions were held.  In Sydney, both volumes and clearance rate also fell last week across the city, when 1,088 properties went to market and a 62.4 per cent success rate was recorded, down from 65.1 per cent across 1,259 auctions the week prior.

Across the remaining auction markets clearance rates improved in Canberra and Perth, while Adelaide, Brisbane and Tasmania’s clearance rate fell over the week.

Across the non-capital city regions, the highest clearance rate was recorded across the Geelong region, with 79.3 per cent of the 74 auctions clearing.

"Welcome to this month’s Onthehouse.com.au housing market update

Please find below this month's Onthehouse.com.au housing market update, presented by CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless.

""This month we are reviewing housing market conditions up to the end of February with some focus on the easing rate of decline in dwelling values and which segments of the market have been more resilient to falls.  

Nationally, dwelling values recorded their fifth consecutive monthly decline in February, taking the value of housing 0.8% lower since the market peaked in September last year. ""

"The latest data from the Reserve Bank (RBA) shows that the expansion of housing credit is occurring at a historically sluggish pace as tighter credit policies and slower housing market conditions dampen investment participation in the housing market.

The RBA releases its financial aggregates on the last working day of each month and it provides valuable insight into outstanding credit to all mortgage lenders in Australia.  

The latest data shows that in January 2018, housing credit expanded by 0.5% which was actually greater than the 0.4% expansion the previous month.  Splitting the data by owner occupier and investors, owner occupier credit expanded by 0.6% compared to 0.2% for investors.

The first chart shows the monthly change in housing credit for owner occupiers and investors, while owner occupier credit expansion is tracked fairly steady, there is a clear slowing of credit expansion to investors currently.  The slowdown is being fueled by switching of investor loans to owner occupier and macroprudential policies which limit credit growth to investors.  

The macroprudential policies have come in two waves, the first wave limited lenders from growing investor credit by more than 10%pa while the second wave limited new interest-only lending (which is largely utilised by investors) to 30% of new originations.  The first chart suggests that the first wave actually tightened investor credit growth more than the second wave, highlighted by the fact that in December 2015 investor credit recorded no change while the slowest rate of expansion since the second wave of policies has been 0.2% which is not as severe of a slowdown as that experienced following the first wave of macroprudential policies.

The second chart focusses on the annual change in housing credit and shows the benchmark for the 10% speed limit for investor lending which was introduced by APRA in late 2014. This chart also highlights a relatively steady expansion in owner occupier credit but a slowing expansion of investor credit.

At the end of January 2018, the total value of outstanding housing credit was $1.731 trillion which was an historic high.  As a share of the total value of credit outstanding to lenders, residential housing accounts for a record-high 62.0%.  The data shows a clear preference for lending for residential housing over recent years especially when you consider at the end of 2007, just prior to the GFC, housing accounted for a much lower 51.9% of total outstanding credit.

The fourth chart highlights outstanding investor credit as a share of total outstanding housing credit.  In January 2018, outstanding credit to investors was recorded at $587.9 billion which represented 34.0% of total housing credit.  Although investors make up a significant proportion of outstanding credit, as a share investor credit has been falling since its peak of 38.7% in June 2015.  In fact, the share of credit to investors is at its lowest level since May 2013.

Based on the most recent data from APRA, Australian lenders have comprehensively met the macroprudential targets for investment credit growth and interest only lending.  Considering annual investment credit growth, at 3.0%, continues to track well under the 10% speed limit and interest only lending  is also well under the 30% benchmark, it’s possible investment credit growth could lift over coming months.

Investors do face other headwinds though, with capital gains cooling, yields tracking well below average and depreciation benefits less appealing since the federal government budget last year.

Overall, the expansion in housing credit is now largely being driven by the owner occupier segment of the market.  With mortgage rates expected to rise some time over the next two years and dwelling values falling, it will be interesting to see how long the steady expansion in owner occupier credit can last.

"There are fewer auctions scheduled across the combined capital cities this week, after last week saw volumes reach their highest level so far this year (3,313). CoreLogic is currently tracking 2,762 capital city auctions this week, which is expected to be lower than results from one year ago when 2,907 auctions were held. 

Both Melbourne and Sydney, Australia’s two largest markets are set to see fewer auctions take place this week, with 1,411 Melbourne homes currently scheduled to go under the hammer, down from 1,606 last week and 978 auctions scheduled across Sydney, decreasing from the 1,259 auctions held last week.


All of the remaining capital cities are expected to host fewer auctions this week, with the exception of Adelaide where the amount of auctions scheduled for this week are virtually unchanged from final results last week.

This week, all of the busiest suburbs for auctions are in Victoria; topping the list with 23 scheduled auctions is Reservoir. Following closely with 21 scheduled auctions is Preston, while Craigieburn and Brunswick will be host to 20 and 19 auctions respectively. 

Summary of Last week’s results

Last week, the combined capital cities saw auction volumes reached their highest so far this year with 3,313 held; the higher volumes returned a final auction clearance rate of 66.8 per cent, which was higher than the 66.1 per cent the previous week when volumes were significantly lower (1,992).  

Melbourne’s final auction clearance rate last week maintained strength across a significantly higher volume of auctions week-on-week, with a total of 1,606 auctions held across the city returning a 70.6 per cent rate of clearance, increasing from the week prior when 69.8 per cent of the 932 auctions held were successful.  In Sydney, a final auction clearance rate of 65.1 per cent was recorded across 1,259 auctions, down from the previous weeks 67.8 per cent when 737 auctions were held.
 
Across the smaller auction markets, both volumes and clearance rates increased over the week in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Tasmania, while week-on-week results for Perth remained steady.

Of the non-capital city auction markets, Geelong returned the highest final clearance rate of 86.0 per cent across 52 auctions, while the Gold Coast held the most auctions (64), however only 32.6 per cent cleared

"Although dwelling values have started falling in Sydney, the city remains substantially more expensive than the other capital cities.  In fact, whether you look at the cost of houses or the cost of units, Sydney stands out as being much more expensive.

 
The above table clearly highlights how the cost of a house is substantially higher, despite the recent value falls, than the cost of a house across each of the other capital cities.  The chart also highlights the much greater escalation in house values in Sydney and Melbourne over recent years relative to the other capital cities.

The above table shows the difference in median house values across the individual capital cities currently compared, to five, 10, 15 years ago.

House values are reasonably similar nowadays in Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and Darwin however, that has not been the case historically.  Sydney also stands out as being substantially more expensive than other capital cities.

 Another way to look at the difference in housing costs is looking at Sydney’s premium in terms of the value of a house relative to the other capital cities.  Looking at this over time can potentially offer insight into how over/under valued some markets may be.  With Sydney values falling recently most capital cities have seen a narrowing of the gap in house values nevertheless the gaps are currently recorded at:

Melbourne – Sydney house values are currently 25.9% higher which is the narrowest gap since late 2013.  The average Sydney house value premium since January 2000 has been 39.5%.
Brisbane – the Sydney median house value is currently 96.9% higher, although the gap has reduced recently, the gap was previously this great in early 2003.  The average premium for Sydney houses compared to Brisbane has been 64.7% which is much lower than the current gap.
Adelaide – the median Sydney house currently costs 128.7% more than the Adelaide median house with a gap this wide never previously seen.  The average Sydney premium over time has been 86.4%.
Perth – Sydney median house values are currently 116.7% greater than those in Perth.  The last time the differential was so great was early in 2004.  The average premium for Sydney houses has been recorded at a much lower 62.1%.
Hobart – Sydney’s median house value is currently 142.7% higher than Hobart’s with the gap having narrowed recently however, before the recent period the last time the gap was this wide was late 2003.  Since 2000, the average premium for Sydney has been 122.7%.
Darwin – a Sydney house typically costs 121.7% more than a Darwin house compared to a long-term average premium of 66.2%.  The last time Sydney’s premium was this large was mid-2004.
Canberra – Sydney median house values are currently 56.1% higher than those in Darwin with the gap previously this large back in early 2003.  Since 2000, the average premium for a Sydney house relative to Canberra has been a lower 36.3%.

 

 It is a similar story when looking at unit values, with Sydney values falling recently yet remaining much higher than those across the remaining capital cities.  Again, values have increased over recent years in Sydney and Melbourne while there has been minimal change elsewhere.

 

Sydney’s current median unit value of $762,509 is noticeably higher than in all other capital cities.  In fact, the median unit value in Sydney is higher than the median house value in all other capital cities except Melbourne which highlights just how expensive housing is in Sydney.  Even in Melbourne, the current median unit value ($572,115) is greater than the current median house value in all cities other than Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.

 
Looking again at the Sydney premium it should be noted that there has been a recent decline in some of the differentials due to the declines in Sydney values.  Nevertheless, the premium for Sydney units relative to other capital cities remain well above long-term average levels:

Melbourne – over the long-term the average premium for a Sydney unit has been recorded at 28.5% while the current premium is a slightly higher 33.3%.  Before the recent period, the last time the gap was so large was in early 2005.
Brisbane – Sydney’s median unit value currently sits 98.3% higher than Brisbane’s which is the largest premium since late 2002.  The average premium for a Sydney unit over Brisbane has been recorded at 54.1%.
Adelaide – the median unit value in Sydney is currently 128.5% higher than in Adelaide which is widest differential in values since early 2003.  The long-term average premium for a Sydney unit is 97.9%.
Perth – Sydney median unit values are currently 88.7% higher than those in Perth which is much greater than the average premium of 48.4%.  In fact, the last time the premium was lower than the average was the middle of 2015 and the last time the gap was so wide was late 2003.
Darwin – a Sydney unit typically costs 121.3% more than a unit in Darwin currently which is the widest differential since mid-2004.  The average premium for a Sydney unit has been recorded at 65.7%.
Canberra – over the long-term, the premium for Sydney units to those in Canberra has been recorded at 38.9% compared to 76.8% currently.  Before the recent period, the last time the gap was so wide was late in 2001.

With house and unit values starting to decline in Sydney we should see a further fall in the premium that houses and units experience relative to the other capital cities.

Despite an anticipated fall in the Sydney premium, it shouldn’t necessarily be expected that the gap will revert to longer-term average levels.  Over recent years, housing costs in Sydney and Melbourne have become demonstrably more expensive than those elsewhere.  Some drivers of this have included but not been limited to an undersupply of new housing (Sydney more so than Melbourne), high rates of migration to each of these cities, stronger economic performances of NSW and Vic relative to other states and territories and significantly greater employment opportunities in Sydney and Melbourne than in other capital cities.  Although values are starting to fall in Sydney and Melbourne, most of these drivers remain for both Sydney and Melbourne.  In fact migration is picking up into Qld but to-date there has been only moderate increases in values.  

We would expect the Sydney premium to reduce over the coming years as values decline however, we also believe that historical premiums for Sydney relative to other capital cities don’t reflect the likely differentials in the cost of housing going forward.  That is to say we expect that the cost of housing in Sydney and Melbourne will continue to be higher relative to other capital cities than it has been in the past.

Published: 27 February 2018",2021_04_23,27-Feb-18,NSW,How Do The Other Capital Cities Housing Values Compare To Sydney?
"This week, we take a look at the housing cycle over the past two decades focusing on growth throughout the regions in five year increments.

Over the past two decades, dwelling values have increased by 231% nationally with increases of 252% across the combined capital cities and 167% across the combined regional markets.  The greatest increase in values has been recorded in Melbourne (335%) while the most moderate increase has been recorded in Regional WA where values are just 85% higher.

The accompanying charts show value growth across the country in five year increments.  Note that data for the NT is not available until 1999 so no figures are shown for growth to 2003.

The five years to January 2003 contains much of the housing boom that occurred from the turn of the century.  Over the period, combined capital city dwelling values increased by 64.0% and combined rest of state values increased by 54.0%.  Although capital cities broadly outperformed regional markets, regional NSW recorded the greatest rise in values over the period (84.1%) followed closely by Canberra (79.0%) and then Melbourne (69.9%).  Over the same period, regional WA (18.8%) and regional Tas (21.8%) recorded substantially lower value growth than other regions.  

Between January 1998 and January 2003, Sydney was the only capital city which recorded a lower rate of value growth than its rest of state region (Regional NSW).

The five years to January 2008 represents the period leading up to the global financial crisis (GFC) which was characterized by the early stages of a mining/infrastructure boom which saw dwelling values surge in areas related to the resources sector.

Over this period, values across the combined rest of state markets (52.5%) increased at a faster pace than the combined capital cities (42.4%) which is largely due to the relevant underperformance of growth in Sydney and Melbourne where economic conditions are more reliant on the performance of the services sector.

The five years to January 2008 saw Sydney (12.6%), regional NSW (26.9%) and regional Vic (38.5%) record the lowest rates of value growth.  At the other end of the spectrum, values more than doubled over the five year period in Perth (102.0%) and regional WA (120.7%).

Although value growth was generally stronger for capital cities than regional markets, regional NSW, regional WA and regional Tas were the only regional markets that recorded stronger value growth than their capital city counterparts.

The five year period to January 2013 included the GFC declines in dwelling values and an additional period of decline between 2010 and 2012 as the GFC stimulus was removed from the market.

Over this five year period, combined capital city dwelling values increased by 5.0% while the combined rest of state regions recorded value falls of -4.0%.  Over the timeframe, Darwin (31.8%) and regional NT (38.1%) were largely unaffected by the slowdown in the housing market with no other region recording value growth in excess of 18%.  On the other hand, each of Brisbane, Perth, Hobart, regional NSW, regional Qld, regional WA and regional Tas recorded falls in dwelling values over the period.

The final chart shows the change in dwelling values over the most recent five year period to January 2018.  Over this period dwelling value growth has been heavily slanted towards Sydney and Melbourne (despite falls over recent months).  

Over the five year period, capital city dwelling values (43.5%) have increased at more than double the rate of rest of state region values (18.4%).  

Sydney (64.4%) and Melbourne (56.4%) have recorded the greatest value rises over the past five years with no other regions recording value growth of more than 38%.  Regions of WA and NT have seen values slide over the period down -4.4% in Perth, -20.0% in Darwin, -19.8% in regional WA and -4.6% in regional NT.  Regional SA (-1.7%) has also recorded a decline in values over the period.

For Sydney and to a lesser extent Melbourne, the most recent five years bears a similarity to the five years to January 2003.  With values now starting to decline in each city it is reasonable to expect that like the five year period to January 2008 these markets may underperform the national and capital city benchmarks.  In fact when you consider values are 231% higher over the past 20 years nationally and Sydney (239%) and Melbourne (335%) have recorded value rises in excess of this benchmark, a softer period of growth going forward should be seen as both reasonable and a healthy development for these markets.

"There were 2,980 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 65.9 per cent, while last week, 3,313 auctions were held and the final clearance rate came in at 66.8 per cent. Over the same week last year, auction volumes were slightly lower with 2,907 homes going under the hammer across the combined capital cities, although the clearance rate was a stronger 74.6 per cent. 


If we look at results by property type, units outperformed the house market this week with 67.6 per cent of units selling at auction, while 65.1 per cent of houses sold across the combined capital cities.


In Melbourne, Australia’s largest auction market, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 67.3 per cent was recorded across 1,523 auctions this week, down from 70.6 per cent across 1,606 auctions last week. One year ago, the clearance rate was a stronger 78.4 per cent across 1,459 auctions. There were 1,044 auctions held in Sydney this week returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 66.9 per cent, compared to 65.1 per cent across 1,259 last week, and 76.0 per cent across 950 auctions one year ago. 


Across the smaller auction markets, preliminary results show that Canberra was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with a 70.8 per cent success rate.

"How much are the properties worth in your suburb? If you are thinking of selling, how much will your place sell for? There are two major metrics that property professionals look at to answer this question; which one should you focus on?

Understanding the difference between median sales price and median value can provide you with useful insights into exactly what is going on in your local market.

The traditional metric is median sales price. This is the median – or middle – price of all the properties that have sold within the suburb over a period. Typically, a median sales price is measured over at least 12 months, with at least 10 sales to determine a median sales price (the more sales the better). 

In any given suburb across Australia, an average of only 7% of properties are usually for sale at any given time. Median sales price, is therefore by its definition, the middle price of what is selling. 

Furthermore, the percentage change in median sales price measures the difference in what is selling now, compared to what was selling for the previous period, which can make median sales price changes appear more volatile. For instance, in a suburb where housing stock is majority comprised of three-bedroom homes, a new development of two-bedroom home sales may skew the median sales price lower.

Alternatively, a cluster of homes may have been renovated up to four bedrooms and now boast more luxury fittings and features, which may skew the median sales price higher.

The second metric is median value, which is a much more stable metric, because of the amount of data used to determine the figure. It is based on a calculation for every property across a suburb or geography, not just those that are sold. This means thousands of properties and close to 100% of the housing stock are used to determine the figure. 

At CoreLogic, our valuation systems calculate the value of every property across Australia every day. Because our systems power the majority of the banking and valuation industries, who require data with extraordinary accuracy, the median value is the middle value of every individual property within the suburb at a given time. 

While median values may not show as dramatic growth or change as median sales price, they are largely regarded as being a more definitive figure of how a bank would value a property.

If the median value is higher or lower than the median sales price, this could be because your property is different to the types of properties currently selling (which you can check by looking at recent sales online and identifying property features) or it could be due to buyer demand. 

If both the median value and median sales price is significantly lower than what you’d like to get for your home, maybe rethink selling, as it’s an indication that your price expectations are out of alignment with the market.

Remember, the only truth is on auction or sales day – as your home is only ever worth what someone is prepared to pay for it.

"This week, CoreLogic is currently tracking 3,017 capital city auctions, increasing from the 1,992 auctions held last week.

As usual, Melbourne and Sydney are the two busiest capital city auction markets this week, with 1,485 and 1,120 auctions scheduled; up from last week’s final result of 932 and 737 auction’s held respectively.

Across the smaller markets, activity is expected to be higher week-on-week in each capital city.

The overall number of properties scheduled for auction this week is expected to be lower than final results from the same week last year when 3,301 auctions were held.

Craigieburn in Victoria is the busiest suburb for auctions across the nation this week, with 22 homes set to go to go under the hammer. Following closely is Randwick and St Ives in NSW both with 21 scheduled auctions.

Summary of Last Week’s results

The final auction clearance rate across the combined capital cities rose to 66.1 per cent across a higher volume of auctions last week, with 1,992 auctions held, increasing from the 1,470 auctions the week prior when 63.7 per cent cleared.  Last week’s clearance rate was lower than the 74.9 per cent recorded one year ago when volumes were higher (2,291).
 

There were 932 Melbourne auctions held last week, increasing from the 619 over the week prior, however final results saw the final auction clearance rate fall, returning a 69.8 per cent clearance rate last week down from the 70.7 per cent the previous week. In Sydney, the final auction clearance rate rose to 67.8 per cent last week across a higher volume of auctions with 737 held, up from 522 the week prior when 61.1 per cent sold.

Across the smaller auction markets, Perth was the only capital city to see an increase in clearance rate, with Adelaide, Brisbane and Tasmania all recording a fall week-on-week.  
 
Geelong was the best performing non-capital city region last week, with 87.5 per cent of the 52 auctions successful.

"The number one top performing suburb for consistent capital growth in Australia is scenic Cockatoo, 48km east of Melbourne in the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria, according to new research from CoreLogic.

Houses in Cockatoo have a median value of $569,177 and grew by 41.6% over the past 12 months and 64.6% over 3 years. Cockatoo was one of 6 Victorian suburbs that made the national top 10 and one of 39 Victorian suburbs that were ranked in the top 50. 

The new Top Performing Suburbs Report identifies suburbs where median value growth across 12 months, 3 years, five years has been higher than 15%. The formula, together with a range of other criteria, identifies suburbs and property types that have demonstrated consistent growth historically. 

“Every suburb in the top 50 national report had median value growth higher than 15%,” said Tim Lawless, Research Director at CoreLogic.  

“The range of growth for 12 months performance was between 41.6% as the highest and 25% at the lowest. The range of median value growth across 5 years for these suburbs was 126.3% and 31.1%.”

The report was created by analysing the house and unit markets across more than 12,000 suburbs across Australia. The initial task was to identify areas that had a reasonable volume of sales to ensure the suburbs put forward were not volatile markets. As such, suburbs with fewer than 50 house or unit sales were removed, as were suburbs that did not record median value growth across 12 months, 3 years, 5 years or 10 years. 

Suburbs were then ranked from highest to lowest by their median value performance over the past 12 months to one decimal point. Where suburbs had identical growth levels, the ranking next looked at 3 year growth. The Top Performing Suburbs report is available at national and state levels. 

Victoria dominated the national list with 39 of the top 50 suburbs while there were seven from NSW and two in Queensland. There was just one suburb in Tasmania and one in WA. 

“These results are in alignment with the performance of the housing market generally being a two speed market of Victoria and NSW performing more strongly than the rest of the country,” Mr Lawless said. 

Housing market suburbs made up 41 of the top 50, while just nine suburbs were based on capital growth for units.

Houses in Cottesloe in Perth were the surprise inclusion in the national rankings as the lone WA suburb to make the cut. Cottesloe was ranked fourth with 12 month median value growth of 38.7% and a median house value of $2,308,698. Mr Lawless said while the Perth market had under-performed as a whole compared to the eastern states, Cottesloe demonstrated that desirable locations with quality homes at the premium end of the market would often buck general trends. 

Top 5 Performing Suburbs by Consistent Median Value Growth
Ranking	State	Suburb	Property Type	% Median Value Growth
1.	VIC	Cockatoo	Houses	41.6%
2.	QLD	Yeronga	Houses	40.9%
3.	VIC	Ardeer	Houses	38.8%
4.	WA	Cottesloe	Houses	38.7%
5.	VIC	Broadmeadows	Houses	34.2%

 

Median house values in the report ranged from $383,348 in Melton, Victoria to $3,095,398 in Cremorne, NSW. Median unit values ranged from $369,773 in Cranbourne, Vic to $801,754 in Byron Bay, NSW.

The highest frequency value range in this report is between $503,713 and $599,517. There were 16 suburbs in this range.

Please find below this month's Onthehouse.com.au housing market update, presented by CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless.

""CoreLogic reported further slippage in dwelling values over the first month of 2018, with national dwelling values recording their second consecutive month on month decline. After dwelling values held firm in October and November, they slipped by a third of a percent in both December and January to be down 0.7% from their peak. 

The fall in national dwelling values was broad based across the capitals, but continues to be led by Sydney, where values were down almost 1% over the month to be 3.1% lower since their peak back in July last year. Month on month falls were recorded across every capital city except Brisbane, where values were steady, and Hobart where dwelling values continued their strong run of growth, surging another 1% higher.

Last week 1,992 auctions were held across the capitals with 66.1 per cent clearing, while over the same week one year ago a 78.4 per cent clearance rate was recorded across a higher volume of auctions (3,301).  


Results segregated into property type showed that units outperformed the house market this week, with 72.9 per cent of units selling at auction, while 69.5 per cent of houses sold across the combined capitals.

Melbourne returned a preliminary auction clearance rate of 71.7 per cent this week, which was higher than final figures from last week which saw 69.8 per cent of auctions clearing. Melbourne’s higher preliminary clearance rate was across a significantly higher volume of auctions week-on-week, with 1,610 held, up from last week’s 932 auctions.   In Sydney, 1,221 homes were taken to auction this week, returning an equal highest preliminary result to Melbourne’s 71.7 per cent, increasing on last week’s final clearance rate of 67.8 per cent across a lower volume of auctions (737).


Across the smaller auctions markets, Adelaide was the best performing in terms of clearance rate with 75.9 per cent of the 107 auctions reporting as sold. While Perth returned the lowest preliminary auction clearance rate of 52.6 per cent.

"The volume of new loans to first home buyers in New South Wales and Victoria has climbed substantially over recent months as value growth has slowed and even begun to fall in Sydney and Melbourne.  First home buyers must be vigilant about purchasing homes and not just be lured into buying at the peak of the market because of attractive incentives.

In New South Wales, from 1 July 2017 first home buyers don’t have to pay stamp duty for both new and existing homes for properties up to $650,000. Stamp duty payable is reduced for buyers paying between $650,000 and $800,000.  In Victoria, if you buy a new or established home from July 1 2017 no stamp duty is payable on homes worth less than $600,000 and stamp duty is reduced for properties worth between $600,000 and $750,000.

The removal of stamp duty has resulted in a substantial increase in first home buyer housing finance commitments.  Over the six months from July to December 2017 there were 14,279 first home buyer finance commitments in New South Wales and 18,675 in Victoria.  To put this into some sort of perspective, over the six months prior to the new incentives going live there had been 7,891 first home buyer housing finance commitments in New South Wales and 12,683 commitments in Victoria.  This represents an increase in first home buyer volumes over the two six month periods before and after the changes to incentives of 81.0% in New South Wales and 47.2% in Victoria.

Since the stamp duty changes, average loan sizes have increased by 1.3% in New South Wales compared to an increase of 1.1% over the previous six months.  This seemingly suggests that the first home buyers entering the market are not using the removal of the stamp duty barrier to borrow more.  In Victoria, it is a bit of a different story with average first home buyer loan sizes increasing 7.0% over the past six months compared to a 2.7% increase over the previous six months.  This would seem to suggest in Victoria, the stamp duty concessions are leading to mortgagees borrowing more.

The most concerning thing for any potential first home buyer in the current New South Wales and Victoria markets should be the lure of entering a market which has been growing rapidly for many years.  In fact, recent data for Sydney and Melbourne indicates that values are now declining.  Across all of New South Wales, values have fallen -2.4% from their August 2017 peak to January 2018 with values -3.1% lower in Sydney and not yet declining in regional New South Wales.  In Victoria, values are -0.1% lower than their November 2017 peak with declines of -0.4% in Melbourne and no declines as yet in regional Victoria.  An important point to note is that the rate of value growth is slowing in regional areas of New South Wales and Victoria although the slowdown is greater in regional New South Wales to-date.

While those declines may sound quite minor, first home buyers are generally most sensitive to changes in interest rates.  Although rates are currently expected to be on hold until early 2019, the combination of already falling dwelling values and potentially higher mortgage rates in the medium-term, these factors should raise some alarm bells for potential buyers.  For first home buyers there may be a sense that the removal of stamp duty along with the falling share of investors in the market creates the opportunity for entry however, ideally you do not want to be buying into a market which has only recently entered a downturn.  

The best bet for potential first home buyers may not be to jump at the incentives which are currently available.  With values declining and investor demand continuing to trend lower a better option may be to remain on the sidelines somewhat longer as values potentially continue to slide.  By doing this you potentially avoid going into negative equity immediately, you potentially buy at a lower price and you have time to save an even larger deposit for your mortgage.  Furthermore, for well qualified borrowers with substantial deposits banks are competing heavily and offering substantial discounts for owner occupiers taking out principal and interest mortgages so if you take time and shop around you may be able to get a really good mortgage rate.

"As auction volumes return to more normal levels after the festive period slowdown, auction clearance rates are holding higher than late 2017.

A preliminary auction clearance rate of 69.1 per cent was recorded across the combined capital cities as auction activity ramped up this week, with a total of 1,963 homes taken to auction, increasing from the 1,490 auctions held last week when (based on final results) 63.7 per cent cleared. While auction activity has increased over the last couple of weeks coming out of the slowdown, volumes are increasing at a slower pace than what was seen over the equivalent period last year (2,291).  


Sydney’s preliminary clearance rate was recorded at 74.3 per cent across 718 scheduled auctions; well above the trend over the final quarter of 2017 where auction clearance rates were tracking in the low 50 per cent range.  A preliminary auction clearance rate of 70.7 per cent was recorded across Melbourne, which is unchanged from last week’s final clearance rate, however volumes increased this week with 923 auctions held up from 619 last week.  


This will be the first week in some time where Sydney has outperformed Melbourne, however as final results are collect it will be interesting to see how this revises.

The performance across the smaller auction markets was varied this week, with Adelaide recording a preliminary auction clearance rate of 67.3 per cent, while only 12.5 per cent of auctions were successful in Tasmania. 

Looking at results by broad property types, Sydney houses were the best performing market this week, with 74.6 per cent of properties selling, followed closely by Melbourne’s unit market with 74.1 per cent of units selling, which was higher than Sydney’s units.

"The days on market metric provides an indication as to how quickly properties sold by private treaty are likely to sell.  The current data at a national and capital city level shows fairly steady days on market however, we are seeing diverging trends across the individual cities.

At the end of 2017, properties sold by private treaty across the nation typically took 45 days to sell and across the combined capital cities they took 40 days to sell.  Both the capital city and national measure has been reasonably steady over recent months however, the days on the market figure for each region was slightly lower a year earlier.  In December 2016 it typically took 44 days to sell a property across the nation and 37 days across the combined capital cities.

 

The trends are changing quite significantly across the individual capital cities. 

Sydney

The typical home took 42 days to sell in December 2017, up from 34 days a year earlier.  The 42 days it currently takes to sell is the longest time on market since May 2016 and up from its recent low of 29 days in February 2017.

Melbourne  

Homes in the city typically take 33 days to sell which is up from 29 days at the end of 2016.  The 29 days at the end of 2016 was also a recent low in days on market for the city.

Brisbane  

In December 2016 the typical home took 47 days to sell while a year later they were taking 53 days to sell.  The days on market figure has been trending higher since reaching a recent low of 43 days in March 2017.

Adelaide  

Properties currently take 41 days to sell which is down from 43 days a year earlier.  The typical days on market has been falling over recent months in Adelaide.

Perth  

There has been a consistent decline in the days on market figure over the past year falling from 58 days to 53 days.  After recently peaking at 75 days in August 2017 there has been a sharp fall over recent months.

Hobart  

Properties are currently taking 33 days to sell which is marginally lower than the 34 days a year ago.  Homes have been selling quite quickly in Hobart over the past two years as value growth has accelerated.

Darwin  

The days on market figure for the city at 75 days is substantially lower than the 88 days recorded a year earlier and well down on the recent peak of 119 days in March 2017.

Canberra  

At 42 days, properties are taking longer to sell currently than they were a year ago when they took 39 days. 

With dwelling values now falling in Sydney and slowing across many cities it is reasonable to expect that over the coming 12 months the number of days it takes to sell a property will trend higher.  In particular this is likely to occur in Sydney (where values are already falling) and Melbourne given that both cities have experience rapid rates of sale and strong growth in dwelling values over recent years.  Vendors in those cities were market conditions are softening will need to be realistic about their pricing expecations; as properties take longer to sell, buyers will be more inclined to negotiate on asking prices and vendors may face higher competition from other properties listed for sale as inventory levels rise.

On the other hand, markets such as Perth, where housing values have been falling, are now showing a reduction in total advertised stock levels and homes are starting to sell in fewer days which should help to dampen further value falls.

This week, the number of auctions scheduled to take place will rise across the combined capital cities, with 1,753 currently being tracked by CoreLogic, up from last week when 1,470 were held.

Melbourne is expected to see the most significant increase in volumes over the week, with 840 properties scheduled for auction, up from 619 last week. Across Sydney, 605 homes are set to go under the hammer this week, increasing from the 522 last week.

Across the smaller auctions markets, Brisbane is set to be the only capital city to see a rise in auction activity this week.

Overall auction activity is set to be lower than the corresponding week last year (2,291).

Victoria has the busiest suburbs for auctions this week, with 20 homes set to go to auction in Craigieburn, followed by Bentleigh East with 14 and Reservoir with 13 scheduled auctions.

Summary of Last Week’s results

Last week, the final auction clearance rate increased across the combined capital cities, returning a 63.7 per cent clearance rate across almost double the volume of auctions week-on-week (1,470). Over the week prior, a clearance rate of 62.0 per cent was recorded across 790 auctions. Both auction clearance rate and volumes were lower than what was seen one year ago, when a 73.2 per cent clearance was recorded across 1,591 auctions.

Across Melbourne, auction volumes rose over the week returning a higher clearance rate, with 619 auctions held and 70.7 per cent successful, up from the 292 auctions the week prior when 70.2 per cent cleared.  Last week saw Sydney’s final clearance rate increase to 61.1 per cent from 57.1 per cent the previous week, with the number of auctions held increasing over the week, with 522 held up from 216 the previous week.

Across the remaining auction markets, clearance rates increased over the week in Brisbane, Canberra and Tasmania, while Adelaide and Perth returned a lower clearance rate.

The Gold Coast was the busiest non-capital city region last week, with 50 auctions; however Geelong recorded the strongest clearance rate at 80 per cent.

"Value growth over the past decade has been characterised by substantial value rises in Sydney and Melbourne while elsewhere capital gains have been materially lower, in fact negative in some regions.

Over the past decade the Australia housing market has been impacted by the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), periods of rising and falling mortgage rates, heightened levels of investment and growing demand for housing from offshore buyers.  Additionally, the national economy has transitioned away from a boom in the commodity cycle and major resources related infrastructure projects towards the services sector and housing construction. The market has also seen significant variation in the rates of value growth with Sydney and Melbourne leading the way.  

The first chart shows the cumulative change in dwelling values over the 10 years to January 2018.  Over the period, values across the nation increased by 41.8% however, it is important to note this was heavily influenced by the two largest housing markets, Sydney and Melbourne.  In fact, while nationally dwelling values have increased by 41.8% over the past decade, only Sydney (79.3%), Melbourne (72.4%) and regional Victoria (42.7%) have recorded value growth in excess of that figure.

Three regions of Australia have seen dwelling values which are currently lower than they were a decade ago.  These regions are Perth (-6.9%), Regional Qld (-5.1%) and regional WA (-29.5%).  Although all other regions have recorded value increases over the past decade, there has been growth of less than 10% over the decade in Darwin (5.4%) and regional SA (4.0%).

In early 2008 the GFC hit and dwelling values began to slide.  Although the periods of decline varied across regions, generally values started to fall early in 2008 with value growth returning in early 2009.   The declines were fairly short and sharp.  The declining housing market was reversed due to two main factors: a swift reduction in mortgage rates and the introduction of government stimulus including additional first home buyer incentives which helped stimulate growth in demand and subsequently values.

During the GFC downturn, all regions of the country recorded declines with national values falling by -7.9% between February 2008 and January 2009.  Western Australia was particularly hard hit by the downturn with values falling by double-digits in Perth (-11.0%) and Regional WA (-12.2%) while all other regions avoided double-digit value falls.  Value declines during the GFC downturn were relatively minor in Darwin (-1.5%), Regional SA (-2.4%) and Regional NT (-2.2%).

Following the stimulus-led re-inflation of dwelling values post-GFC, as the stimulus was removed from the market values once again started to fall.

First home buyer incentives were removed and the Reserve Bank started to lift interest rates from their generational lows.  Between 2010 and 2012, although timing does vary somewhat across the regions, the national housing market once again experienced value declines.

Between June 2010 and February 2012, national dwelling values fell by -6.5% with capital cities experiencing slightly larger falls than regional markets.

In this downturn, Qld was hardest hit with Brisbane (-10.6%) and regional Qld (-11.1%) the only regions to record double-digit value falls.  By comparison, Sydney (-3.7%), regional Vic (-3.6%) and regional SA (-3.0%) recorded relatively minor value declines throughout the period.

More recently, softer housing market conditions have become evident with a number of regions starting to see values decline.  The final chart highlights the change between current dwelling values and the historic housing market peak.  

Nationally, dwelling values are -0.7% off their peak with the combined capital cities (-1.0%) the main driver of the weakness.  In fact, Brisbane and Hobart are the only capital cities in which values at the end of January 2018 were not lower than their previous peak.  Perth (-10.9%), Darwin (-21.7%) and regional WA (-29.5%) currently have dwelling values which are more than 10% below their previous peaks.

The data presented within highlights that despite most regions of the country having seen dwelling values increase over the past decade, within that decade there have been periods in which values have fallen.  The data presented also highlights how during the value growth periods, growth has very much been slanted towards the Sydney and Melbourne markets.

With dwelling values now falling in a number of regions, it will be interesting to see how rapidly values fall, what may or may not be done to slow the falls and how the market declines will compare to other periods of decline over the past decade.

"Upcoming auctions

The combined capital cities are set to see a notable increase in activity over the week, with 1,371 properties scheduled to go to auction, this is an increase of 74 per cent on last week when only 790 auctions were held coming out of the holiday period slowdown. When compared to last year, volumes are expected to be lower this week than the 1,591 auctions held over the corresponding week last year.

The number of scheduled auctions across Sydney is set to be lower than results from one year ago (640), with 481 auctions scheduled to take place this week which is over double the volume of auctions held last week (216).

Across Melbourne, Australia’s other major market, the number of properties scheduled to go to auction this week increased to 575, up from last week’s 292, and only slightly lower than final figures one year ago (556).

Across the smaller markets, the number of scheduled auctions has increased over the week in Brisbane, Canberra, Perth and Tasmania, while volumes in Adelaide have decreased over the week.

Point Cook in Victoria is the busiest suburb for auctions this week, with 12 homes set to go under the hammer, followed by Dee Why in NSW (11), while Bentleigh East, Glen Waverley and Mulgrave in Victoria each have 10 scheduled auctions.

Summary of Last Week’s results

Last week, the combined capital cities returned a final auction clearance rate of 62 per cent across 790 auctions, with both clearance rate and volumes recording lower than last year when 68.8 per cent of the 881 auctions cleared.

The two strongest auction markets in terms of clearance rate last week were Melbourne and Adelaide, with both cities recording a 70.2 per cent rate of clearance. Followed by Canberra (62.2 per cent) and Sydney (57.1 per cent), while Brisbane, Perth and Tasmania all recorded clearance rates at or below 50 per cent.

It is expected that auction volumes will returned to normal levels in the coming weeks and a true reading of auction market conditions can be established.

Outside of the capital city markets, Geelong returned a final clearance rate of 88.9 per cent across 20 auctions. While the Gold Coast recorded the highest volume of auctions with 96 held, however only 46.9 per cent were successful.

"Data for landmark new reports to understand how property managers are perceived by both landlords and tenants is currently being collected in two new surveys by CoreLogic.

The Landlord Perceptions of Property Managers survey, and the Tenants Perceptions of Property Managers survey are part of the Perceptions of Real Estate Agents series to understand the experiences of consumers when using real estate agents. 

Past reports – which examined the experience of Sellers and Buyers – found that while the majority of consumers had positive experiences with agents, there was still significant room for improvement.

Both reports identified areas where agents need to work harder – such as being transparent around pricing properties, responding promptly to inquiries and managing the expectations of sellers and buyers across the sales experience. 

The reports showed 68% of sellers and 57% of buyers would recommend their agent to friends or family. 

Kylie Davis, the Head of Content at CoreLogic said the property manager surveys would ensure the full scope of consumer experience with real estate agents was examined.
 
With rent rolls a major factor in how real estate offices are valued as assets, insights from the research will help identify how principals can grow their business. 

“Property management teams are often neglected departments within real estate offices, but the work that property managers do with landlords and tenants can play a major role in how a real estate office is perceived within the community and be a major source of sales referrals,” Ms Davis said.

“The reports that come out of the surveys will identify what differentiates the really great property managers from the average ones. I’m really curious to find out whether tenants and landlords have different or similar experiences – we’ll be able to learn a lot from comparing the data from both surveys.”
The final reports will identify the skills that property managers need to really excel, and start to encourage benchmarking in those behaviours.

"Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for the December 2017 quarter was released earlier this week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

According to the release, headline CPI rose by 0.6% over the quarter to be 1.9% higher over the year.  The Reserve Bank’s (RBA) preferred measure of inflation (underlying inflation) showed an increase of 0.4% over the quarter to also be 1.9% higher over the year.  The RBA has a target range for underlying inflation of 2% to 3% p.a. and the latest data shows that underlying inflation has not been within the target range for two years.

With the release of CPI data ‘real’ changes in dwelling values can also be analysed.  On a nominal basis, national dwelling values fell by -0.3% over the December 2017 quarter however, when that is adjusted for inflation the fall becomes a much greater decline of -1.0%.  That represents the largest quarterly fall in real dwelling values since they declined by -1.3% over the September 2012 quarter.  It was a similar story across the combined capital cities where real dwelling values fell by -1.2% over the quarter which was the largest quarterly fall since December 2011.

 
Across the individual capital cities, nominal changes in values resulted in a decline in values over the quarter in Sydney and Darwin.  Once inflation is accounted for, only Melbourne, Hobart and Canberra recorded real increases in dwelling values over the quarter.  The slowdown in dwelling value growth over the final quarter of 2017 resulted in real value falls in a majority of capital cities.  For Sydney, the -2.7% fall in real dwelling values was the largest quarterly fall since September 2008 when real values were -3.4% lower over the quarter.

 
While both real and nominal dwelling values fell over the final quarter of 2017 they were higher throughout the 2017 calendar year.  Nationally, nominal dwelling values increased by 4.2% in 2017 and were 2.3% higher in real terms.  Perth and Darwin were the only capital cities to record real falls in values over the year however, growth in Sydney decelerated significantly. 

Over the past decade, real dwelling values have fallen in five of eight capital cities and have barely risen within Hobart. Although across the combined capital cities and National indices real dwelling values have increased that has been entirely driven by rises in Sydney and Melbourne.

"Brisbane is well placed to take over as the best performing capital city housing market over the next five years.  Dwelling values across Australia’s third largest capital city have risen at the annual rate of 1.2% of the past decade; that’s half the pace of inflation and dramatically lower than Sydney or Melbourne where annual gains have averaged 6.3% and 5.9% over the past ten years.

Brisbane’s housing market won’t outperform other cities simply because the market has previously underperformed, however the relative gap in pricing between Australia’s largest cities is likely to be one of the factors that attracts housing demand to the city.  At the end of November 2017 Sydney house values were 102% higher than Brisbane’s and Melbourne values were 57% higher.  Based on median household incomes, Sydney households are earning only 12.9% more than households in Brisbane’s and incomes across Melbourne are actually 0.7% lower than Brisbane’s.  

Clearly households aren’t as affected by affordability in Brisbane as significantly as they are in the larger capitals.  This is also visible from more formal affordability measures such as the dwelling price to income ratio and the proportion of household income required to service a mortgage. In Sydney, the dwelling price to income ratio is 9.1 compared with 7.5 in Melbourne and 5.9 in Brisbane.  Similarly, the proportion of gross annual household income required to service an 80% LVR mortgage is now 48.4% in Sydney compared with 39.9% in Melbourne and 31.7% in Brisbane.

Importantly, there are a variety of economic and demographic factors that are likely to support improving market conditions across Brisbane including economic and demographic trends as well as a worsening performance across the larger cities of Sydney and Melbourne which will provide a lower relative benchmark for Brisbane.

Population growth from both overseas and interstate is ramping up into Queensland, with the majority of this growth being experienced within the South East corner of the state.  Net overseas migration remains well below New South Wales and Victoria, however it’s the highest in a bit more than three years.  Net interstate migration is where Queensland is demonstrating its pulling power, attracting the highest number of residents from other states in eight and a half years.  Net migrants crossing the state border into Queensland is now the highest of any state, outpacing Victoria for the first time since June 2013.

"This week across the combined capital cities, auction volumes continued to increase with 1,464 homes taken to auction returning a preliminary clearance rate of 67.7 per cent, increasing from 62.0 per cent across 790 auctions last week, although this is likely to revise down over the week. Over the same week last year 1,591 auctions were held, while the clearance rate was a stronger 73.2 per cent. Adelaide and Perth were the only cities to see clearance rates fall over the week, while volumes increased everywhere except Adelaide. The strongest preliminary clearance rate was recorded in Melbourne (72.5 per cent), followed by Adelaide (68.9 per cent).

Across Melbourne, preliminary results show that 72.5 per cent of the 520 reported auctions sold this week. There were 621 properties taken to auction across the city, up from 292 last week when the final clearance rate was recorded at 70.2 per cent. Over the same week last year, 556 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 75.9 per cent was recorded. The West region of Melbourne had the highest number of auctions this week (128), with a preliminary clearance rate of 72.6 per cent. However, the strongest rate of clearance was recorded across the Mornington Peninsula, where 85.0 per cent of the 20 reported auctions were successful. 7 of the 9 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 70 per cent.

One year ago, 640 auctions were held across Sydney and 80.7 per cent were successful. Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, 6 of the 15 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 70 per cent with the stand outs being the Eastern Suburbs (85.2 per cent), Northern Beaches (79.1 per cent) and the Inner West (75.0 per cent) regions. The lowest clearance rate was recorded across the Sutherland region where 46.7 per cent of the 30 reported auctions were successful.

The preliminary clearance rate in Brisbane this week was 53.8 per cent, up from 45.6 per cent last week. Auction volumes were higher this week with 113 auctions held, compared to 98 last week. Meanwhile, across the Gold Coast, 65.4 per cent of the 26 reported auctions were successful.

In Adelaide, a 68.9 per cent preliminary result was recorded this week across 78 auctions. Last week, 98 Adelaide auctions returned a clearance rate of 70.2 per cent for the city, while at the same time last year, 91 homes were taken to auction, with 66.7 per cent recording a successful result.

Perth’s clearance rate of 29.0 per cent across 31 auction results is lower than last week, when 30 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 47.4 per cent was recorded. Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a lower 25.0 per cent, and 74 auctions were held.

Across Canberra, 73 homes were taken to auction this week. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 67.7 per cent, up from 62.2 per cent the previous week. 

Tasmania was host to 11 auctions this week and so far 8 have been reported with 5 successful sales.

Tasmanian suburbs took out the top three rankings in the report, with houses in Warrane and Glenorchy taking out positions two and three in the rankings. Units in the Queensland suburbs of Reedy Creek and Nambour held the fourth and fifth positions.

*The Top Rental Performers Report is based on settled property sales data to 31 October 2017 from the CoreLogic Market Trends dataset released December 15, 2017.

With investment purchases still making up a significant proportion of the housing market, the Top Rental Performers report reveals 76 suburbs where houses or units have an estimated gross rental yield of 5% or more per annum.

These areas have been identified as making the grade as ‘best rents’ because they demonstrated solid rental yields, consistent rental growth and vacancy rates of less than 3%. They have also performed consistently from a capital growth perspective.

With housing affordability a key issue in the Australian housing market, and strong market growth dominant across the eastern states, most of these suburbs are found in regional and coastal markets as well as satellite cities.

The December report features 32 suburbs where houses represent good rental opportunities and 43 suburbs where units offer the best rental value, while at the same time demonstrating capital growth.

Queensland dominates the list with 24 suburbs overall, followed by 19 NSW and Tasmania with 18. There were 11 suburbs in ACT and 3 in Victoria. No suburbs from Western Australia, South Australia or the NT met the Top Rental Performers criteria.

Median dwelling values in the report ranged from $237,217 to $736,990. The highest frequency value range in this report is between $300,000 and $400,000. There were 34 suburbs in this range.

This report gives investors a starting point when considering purchasing a rental property, and offers areas where finding a positively geared investment is more likely. 

But as with all investing, it is important you do your own research, including visiting the area, understanding local development and infrastructure plans, and assessing your own personal financial circumstances. Paying the right price for the right property will also play a very important part.

"Residential real estate holds significant value for Australians. Financially, it is the country’s largest asset class, with a valuation of over $7 trillion. Emotionally, it defines the Great Australian Dream. 

However, housing affordability has worsened over the past 15 years by every measure. The cost of buying a house is 7.2 times the annual income of a typical household, up from 4.2 times annual household income 15 years ago.

How can the problem be addressed?

In September 2017, 12 young CPAs in Melbourne and Sydney, known as the CPA Changemakers, got together to develop a series of recommendations. Their discussions were informed by data and insights from Peter Munckton, chief economist at Bank of Queensland, Greg Dickason, chief technology officer at CoreLogic, and Andy Gooden, chief operating officer of Little Real Estate.

This ebook is a collaboration between CPA and CoreLogic and is designed to take readers through the CPA Changemakers’ journey of discovery about the Australian property market and the solutions they developed.",2021_04_23,18-Dec-17,N/A,Solving The Housing Affordability Challenge
"We look at the change in dwelling values over the past year across the sub-regions of each capital city and examine how the performance compared to changes over the previous year and the average over the past five years.

SA4 regions are part of the Australian standard geographic hierarchy and in capital cities they typically have populations of between 300,000 and 500,000.  For this reason looking at data at this level provides more detailed insight than just looking at capital city figures. 
 
Across the capital cities there are 46 SA4 regions with the number across each capital city recorded at: 15 in Sydney, 9 in both Melbourne and Brisbane, 4 in Adelaide and 6 in Perth.  The capital city regions of Hobart, Darwin and Canberra are equivalent to an SA4 region.

Change in dwelling values over the past 12 months,
previous 12 months and annually for the
past five years across capital city SA4 regions to Nov-17

Over the 12 months to November 2017, six capital city sub-regions recorded value falls and all of these regions were located in Perth or Darwin.  While only six of these regions recorded annual value falls, 17 of these regions recorded value changes which were lower than at the same time a year ago.  Of the regions which have recorded a lower rate of value growth compared to the previous year, 7 are in Sydney, 2 are in Melbourne, 4 are in Brisbane and there are 2 each in Adelaide and Perth. Given this, more than half of the regions in each capital city except Adelaide have recorded stronger annual value growth this year compared to last.

The story is somewhat different if a comparison is done between value growth over the past 12 months and the compound annual rate over the past 5 years.  All 15 SA4 regions of Sydney have recorded value growth over the past year which is lower than the 5 year annual rate.  Elsewhere, the number of SA4 regions which have underperformed the rate of growth over the past 5 years over the past year are: 3 in Melbourne, 7 in Brisbane, 2 in Adelaide, 5 in Perth and Darwin.  Based on these figures, almost all of the regions of Sydney and Perth and more than half of the regions in Brisbane are underperforming relative to growth over the past five years.  

Data over a shorter timeframe (month and quarter) shows that values are now falling in Sydney, slowing in most capital cities and increasing moderately in Perth.  Given this, the data points to changing conditions over the coming year.  It is anticipated that in 2018, the rate of growth in Sydney and Melbourne SA4 regions will generally be slower than the pace of growth over the past 12 months.  In Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra growth is likely to be similar, potentially slightly softer in Hobart and a little stronger elsewhere.  Meanwhile, with the recent uptick in growth in Perth the performance next year could be stronger as the market emerges from an 11% correction.  Finally, Darwin values have continued to fall however, next year we could see Darwin follow the lead of Perth with the housing market moderately stronger.",2021_04_23,18-Dec-17,N/A,How Does Value Growth Over The Past Year Compare To The Previous Five Years?
"The final week of auction reporting for 2017 returned a preliminary auction clearance rate of 64.2 per cent across the combined capital cities, increasing on last week when the final auction clearance rate fell below 60 per cent for the first time this year, when only 59.5 per cent of auctions cleared. The number of homes taken to auction fell this week, after the surge in activity recorded over the 4 weeks prior when volumes remained consistently above the 3,000 level. There were a total of 2,865 auctions held this week, down on last week when 3,371 auctions where held across the capitals and only slightly higher than volumes from the same week one year ago (2,735). Melbourne and Sydney both saw an increase in preliminary clearance rates this week, with 67.3 per cent and 60.8 per cent of auctions clearing which was up on the previous week when both cities recorded their lowest clearance rates of the year. The smaller auction markets returned varied results this week, with Adelaide recording the highest preliminary auction clearance rate of 70.1 per cent, while only 43.3 per cent of auctions sold in Perth.

 
In Melbourne, Australia’s largest auction market, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 67.3 per cent was recorded across 1,628 auctions this week. Last week, Melbourne’s final clearance rate was recorded at 65.4 per cent across 1,833 auctions, while this time last year, 1,288 properties were taken to auction across Melbourne and a clearance rate of 73.9 per cent was recorded. The busiest Melbourne sub-regions this week were Melbourne’s West region and the North East region, where 307 and 248 auctions were held respectively. 

Sydney’s preliminary clearance rate this week was 60.8 per cent across 690 auctions, increasing on last week’s 52.0 per cent across 1,007. Over the same week one year ago, 878 auctions were held across Sydney and a clearance rate of 71.4 per cent was recorded. Sydney’s Inner South West hosted the most auctions of any Sydney sub-region this week, with 94 properties taken to auction. The preliminary clearance rate for the region is 52.5 per cent across 59 results. 

There were 196 Brisbane auctions this week with a preliminary clearance rate of 54.8 per cent, having increased from 43.7 per cent last week across 186 auctions and higher than one year ago when there were 234 auctions with a success rate of 42.6 per cent. The Gold Coast’s preliminary clearance rate was 40.0 per cent across 25 results this week. 

This week, Adelaide saw a preliminary clearance rate of 70.1 per cent, with 107 reported results across a total of 152 scheduled auctions, increasing on last week’s 65.2 per cent and the 58.4 per cent one year ago.

There were 66 Perth auctions this week and so far 30 results have been reported, with just 43.3 per cent selling. Last week there was a 32.1 per cent clearance rate across 62 auctions.

Across Canberra a total of 122 auctions were held this week, compared to 106 last week and 131 at the same time last year. Canberra’s preliminary clearance rate of 63.4 per cent is lower than it was the previous week (64.0 per cent).

There were only 11 Tasmanian auctions held this week. 4 were reported as sold.

CoreLogic is currently tracking 2,666 scheduled auctions across the combined capital cities over the last week for auction reporting for 2017.  This is lower than last week’s final results which saw 3,371 auctions held and also lower than the 2,735 held over the corresponding week last year.

Week-on-week activity across Melbourne and Sydney is set to fall as the end of year fast approaches, with 1,514 Melbourne homes scheduled to go to auction this week, down from the 1,833 auctions held last week. Last week was the second busiest week for auctions this year across the city.

In Sydney, there are 664 scheduled auctions this week, decreasing from the 1,007 auctions held last week.

Volumes are also expected to fall across the smaller capital cities this week, with the exception of Canberra where the number of scheduled auctions is slightly higher.

All of the busiest suburbs for auctions this week are in Victoria, topping the list with 32 residential homes set to go under the hammer is Reservoir. Followed by Craigieburn (27), Epping (23), and Frankston (23).

Summary of Last Week’s results

The combined capital city final auction clearance rate dropped below 60 per cent for the first time since late 2015/ early 2016 last week, returning a 59.5 per cent rate of clearance across a higher volume of auctions week-on-week.  There were a total of 3,371 auctions held across the cities, increasing on the 3,291 auctions over the week prior when 60.3 per cent cleared. One year ago, a significantly higher 71.6 per cent clearance rate was recorded across a higher volume of auctions (3,432).

Melbourne’s final auction clearance rate last week was unchanged from the week prior, when the city recorded the lowest clearance rate since June 2016 (65.4 per cent). However, volumes across the city reached their second highest level this year, with 1,833 held, up from the 1,647 auctions held the previous week.

Across Sydney, the final clearance rate fell to 52.0 per cent last week, this is the lowest seen since the first auction week of 2016 when volumes were very low.  Prior to that, you would have to go back to December 2012 to see clearance rates so low.  The clearance rate last week was down from the 56.2 per cent the week prior. There were 1,007 auctions held across the city last week, down from the 1,143 held over the week prior.

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates improved in Adelaide and Brisbane, while Canberra, Perth and Tasmania’s final clearance rate fell.

The Gold Coast region was the busiest non-capital city region last week, with 121 auctions, however Geelong recorded the strongest clearance rate at 82.6%.

"With buyer competition still running high despite the slowing market, make sure you avoid the temptation of skipping this important property market research step if you want to succeed as an investor. John Lindeman, researcher and educator with 7 steps 2 Success property market education program explains to Nila Sweeney, Managing Editor of Property Market Insider, market research tips to help you succeed.

Buying a property is an exciting process. It can also be exceedingly frustrating especially when you keep missing out on your target property.

As such you might be tempted to cut corners to reduce the time you spend on your research. Don’t.

I’ve been involved with the property market as a researcher, commentator and author over fifteen years with professional research with major data providers, as well as forty years of personal housing investment experience.

While I use this acquired expertise and experience to help me identify up and coming property hot spots, there is an essential part of my research that I always do, which I recommend that you should always do, before you make any investment purchase decision.

It’s called “on the ground” research

This essentially means taking a look yourself by driving around or pounding the pavement to see whether the published information about an area is right or wrong.

It may even give you new insights into the investment potential of an area that can’t be obtained any other way.

How to do your own on the ground research  quickly and effectively

One of the reasons a lot of buyers skip this part is due to the time it takes to gather the information you need. Therefore, you must be systematic to be able to confirm or refute what the numbers and experts are saying. Here’s how to do it.

1. Drive through the local streets.

Start with your own personal tour of inspection and drive through the local streets to check the general condition of properties and their presentation.

What is the proportion of “For Sale” signs?
Are gardens and lawns well maintained?
Do the streets have skid marks and are there dogs roaming around?
Are there any gated communities and if so, is this because of obvious social issues in the area or to give the impression of security?
2. Drive down the main street on a Saturday morning and see if all the shops are open.
Are there busy sidewalk cafes, people shopping?
Or are half the shops closed, some with ageing and faded “To Let” signs in the windows?

3. Drive down the same street again at 8 pm that evening.
Are the shops shuttered and few people about?
Or are cafes and restaurants open and busy, with people wandering freely around?
4. Talk to property managers.

Ask them about:

The types of renting households,
The types of properties and locations the renters prefer
The average length of stay
Average vacancy periods between lettings.
Lastly, ask each property manager what the vacancy rate is and how many prospective tenants are on their waiting list. A waiting list of prospective tenants is good but a waiting list of empty properties is terrible.
5. Check the area’s potential for over development.

If you are satisfied that the area ticks all the boxes, your last piece of on the ground research is to check for potential oversupply through over development.

While you might view further development in an area as a good outcome, leading to improved amenities and facilities and generating higher prices, the reality is that high-density unit development or new land or house and land subdivisions can have very different outcomes.

It depends on who these dwellings are marketed to as well as their comparative price and quality compared to existing stock in the area.

New developments marketed to owner/occupiers can lead to the rejuvenation of entire localities if the new stock is substantially superior to existing stock, such as in the refurbishment of older inner suburbs in major cities.

On the other hand, they can cause a degradation of prices if the new stock is inferior, such as loft and studio apartments in inner urban areas, or single bed retirement villas in coastal resorts.

New developments marketed off the plan to investors can lead to oversupplies of rental properties if they are marketed to investors and the rate of new rental stock on the market exceeds the rate of demand.

This may not become apparent where and while rental guarantees are provided by the project marketers, but once the rental oversupply emerges it leads to the potential for both rent and price falls as frustrated and even desperate investors try to sell, often many at the same time.  

You need to see whether there is any possibility of an oversupply occurring due to the sheer weight of new stock numbers.

This can easily occur because developers often work without the benefit of reliable predictive demand data for housing. As such, they tend to rely on past performance to select the best areas for new housing and use recent price and rent growth to promote their developments to investors.

3 ways to quickly assess the suburb’s over development risks

Because of the reasons I explained above, you should ensure that your selected suburb is not a candidate for overdevelopment.

You can do this by checking its development potential for land subdivision, house and land sales and medium or high rise unit development using these three research techniques:

First

As you drive or walk around the suburb, check:

Are there are large vacant unused land areas?
Are there roads ending abruptly which are obviously intended to go further in the future?
Are there vacant shopping strips on main roads with no to let signs or blocks or groups of vacant?
Are there derelict terraces or houses in an area with medium to high rise units?

These are all signs that developers own the land.

Second

Check a listing site for new or off the plan house or unit listings.

What often initially appears as one listing on the real estate listing site may reveal a potential development of several hundred units or land subdivision.
Go to the developer’s or project marketer’s site to see their plans for future development of the project, including the number and type of dwellings proposed and the timeline for both sales and occupation.

Third

Check with the local council for any development applications in the area, the number and type of dwellings proposed and the timeline for both sales and occupation.

If there are significant numbers of new developments underway or proposed in a suburb or locality, you need to check:

The developer’s and project marketer’s websites to see who they are being marketed to (overseas investors, local investors or owner/occupiers),
The comparative quality of the new stock compared to existing stock (compare listings for new stock to those for existing stock of similar types of housing)
The asking price of these dwellings compared to existing stock in the area.

On the ground research is not about selecting a possible property to buy – it’s about evaluating the potential of an area to make that it can deliver the best possible results for you.

"This week we look at the dwelling value premium for Sydney compared to the other capital cities over time.

With a median dwelling value of $904,041 in November 2017, Sydney is the nation’s most expensive capital city housing market, despite the recent moderate declines.  In fact, if we look historically Sydney has, outside of a short period in 2006 and 2007 consistently been the most expensive housing market.

It is a valuable exercise to look at how over time Sydney’s premium relative to the other capital city markets has cycled.  The accompanying charts show the Sydney premium over time with the red line highlighting the average premium over the length of the period shown on each chart.

Melbourne

Dwelling values currently sit at $718,325 indicating that Sydney values are 25.9% higher.  The Sydney premium is currently the lowest it has been since April 2014. Over the long-term Sydney’s average premium has been 39.2%.

Brisbane

With a median dwelling value of $490,915, Sydney dwellings are currently 84.2% more expensive than Brisbane’s.  The long-term average premium is 54.1% and the premium has consistently been higher than this average since September 2014.

Adelaide

Sydney dwelling values have, on average, been 180.3% higher than Adelaide’s.  Adelaide’s current median dwelling value of $432,126 sees the Sydney premium at 109.2%.  Sydney has had an above average premium to Adelaide consistently since November 2014.

Perth

The current median dwelling values for the city is recorded at $463,026 which indicates that Sydney’s current median is 95.2% higher compared to a long-term average difference of 60.8%.  The premium for Sydney housing has been above the long-term average since August 2015.

Hobart

With a median dwelling value of $398,093, Sydney’s median value is currently 127.1% higher.  The long-term average Sydney premium is 105.0% indicating that the gap has been wider than average since December 2013.

Darwin

Sydney dwellings are currently 108.9% more expensive than Darwin’s median dwelling value which sits at $432,774.  Over the long-term the average premium for Sydney dwellings has been recorded at 54.9% with the premium consistently above the long-term average since June 2015.

Canberra

The median dwelling value currently sits at $588,788 which means that Sydney has a value premium of 53.5%.  The long-term average premium for Sydney is 33.2% with the premium having been above average consistently since April 2014.

Just because the Sydney premium is currently above the long-term average for most cities doesn’t necessarily mean that we will see a reversion to those long term averages.  In stating this, dwelling values are beginning to fall in Sydney after a substantial increase over recent years.  Assuming these falls continue, the premium relative to the other capital cities is likely to decline.

Across most capital cities the current Sydney dwelling value premium is similarly large to what it was late in 2002 after a significant period of growth for the city.  Following that growth phase, Sydney values peaked in December 2002 and then fell by 8.2% and didn’t eclipse the previous peak until October 2007.  It is reasonable that we could see similar falls over the coming year(s) which would in-turn narrow the gap between the value of housing in other capital cities relative to Sydney.

"This week across the combined capital cities, auction volumes remained high with 3,353 homes taken to auction returning a preliminary clearance rate of 63.1 per cent, increasing from last week when the final clearance rate across the capitals recorded the lowest not only this year, but the lowest reading since late 2015/ early 2016 (60.3 per cent). The lower weighted clearance rates of late can be attributed to the continual softening conditions across the two largest markets of Melbourne and Sydney, with clearance rates tracking below 70 per cent across Melbourne for 5 consecutive week’s now (67.4 per cent), however volumes across the city have been consistently higher; with volumes this week reaching their second highest level this year (1,837), while Sydney’s clearance rates have tracked around the mid-high 50 per cent range over 7 consecutive week’s (58.7 per cent). Across the smaller markets, Canberra recorded the highest preliminary clearance rate this week, with 66.7 per cent of homes selling, while Brisbane returned the lowest with only 46.6 per cent of auctions successful.

In Melbourne, a 67.4 per cent preliminary clearance rate was recorded across the second busiest week for auctions this year, with 1,837 held, up from 1,647 auctions last week when the final auction clearance rate fell to its lowest seen since June 2016 when only 65.4 per cent cleared. One year ago there were 1,685 auctions held, with a notably higher clearance rate (78.4 per cent). The Inner region of Melbourne had the highest number of auctions this week (304), with a preliminary clearance rate of 67.3 per cent. Meanwhile, the strongest clearance rate was recorded across the North West region, where 74.4 per cent of the 182 auctions held sold. 

Sydney’s preliminary clearance rate this week was 58.7 per cent, across a total of 990 auctions held, increasing on last week’s final clearance rate of 56.2 per cent when 1,143 auctions were held. Over the same week last year, 1,163 auctions were held across Sydney and a clearance rate of 73.7 per cent was recorded. North Sydney and Hornsby hosted the most auctions of any Sydney sub-region this week, with 145 properties taken to auction. The preliminary clearance rate for the region is 61.5 per cent across 109 results. 

There were 183 Brisbane homes taken to auction this week, with 131 results reported so far. The preliminary clearance rate for the city is 46.6 per cent, up from 42.8 per cent last week and higher than one year ago, when 43.5 per cent of the 206 properties taken to auction were successful. Across the Gold Coast 83 results have been reported so far, with a success rate of 37.4 per cent. 

A total of 163 Adelaide homes were taken to auction this week, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 65.0 per cent across 120 results, up from 59.1 per cent last week when 144 auctions were held across the city. 

Perth’s clearance rate of 46.7 per cent across 62 auctions is up from the previous week, when 50 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 32.6 per cent was recorded.  Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a lower 20.0 per cent, and 76 auctions were held.

In Canberra, 106 auctions were held this week, and of the 84 reported results, 66.7 per cent were successful. Last week, only 102 auctions were held and the clearance rate was a higher 71.6 per cent. This time last year, results were similar with 118 auctions held and a clearance rate of 60.8 per cent.

In Tasmania, 12 auctions were reported to CoreLogic with 5 sales.

"Welcome to this month’s Onthehouse.com.au housing market update

Please find below this month's Onthehouse.com.au housing market update, presented by CoreLogic Head of Research (AU) Cameron Kusher.

""Nationally, dwelling values were unchanged in November 2017 according to the CoreLogic home value index. The rate of value growth has slowed over recent months due to falls in Australia’s largest housing market Sydney which accounts for around one third of the value of national housing.  

Splitting the monthly change out into the combined capital city and combined regional markets shows that capital city dwelling values fell by -0.1% and regional values rose by 0.2%. Over the past three months, capital city dwelling values were 0.2% higher while regional values increased by 0.4%. ""

"Sydney and Melbourne regions have experienced the strongest value growth over the past decade while the other capital cities have generally seen comparatively moderate value increases.

The CoreLogic Home Value Index data is available at geographic aggregations smaller than just the capital city and states.  In this week’s Pulse we take a look at the SA3 regions across the country that have seen the greatest increase in values over the past decade.  For the analysis we have only included SA3 regions that had an estimated residential population of more than 20,000 as at June 2016.

The region nationally that has recorded the greatest increase in dwelling values over the past decade is Wyndham in Melbourne where values are 129.9% higher.   Wyndham is an outer south-western region of Melbourne which has seen substantial new housing development occur over the past decade.  The region with the second highest rate of value growth has been Pennant Hills – Epping located in the Hills District of Sydney.

When analysing the regions with the greatest value increases, the top 10 regions nationally are all located in either Sydney or Melbourne while Katherine in the Northern Territory is the only region outside of NSW or Vic to have recorded value growth in excess of 50% (52.4%) over the past decade.  This highlights how much stronger value growth has been in Sydney and Melbourne relative to other capital cities over the past decade.

SA3 regions in each state with the greatest increase in
dwelling values, decade to October 2017

The top 5 list for each state and territory shows a significant slant towards capital city regions rather than regional housing markets.  In fact, only Katherine and Alice Springs make the list for the top 5 in each state and territory outside of a capital city.

The top 5 list also highlights just how weak the housing market in Perth has been over the past decade, despite the mining boom supporting strong capital gains over the first half of the decade. Serpentine – Jarrahdale has been the strongest region for growth in WA (17.5%) with every other region of the state recording growth over the decade of less than 5%.

Looking specifically at regions outside of the capital cities, again, most of the best performing regions are in NSW and Vic.  In fact, the top 15 regions listed in the second table have all recorded value increases over the past decade in excess of all of the capital city regions outside of Sydney and Melbourne.   13 of the top 15 regional markets for value growth over the past decade are located in either NSW or Vic.

The top two regional markets for value growth over the past decade, Dapto – Port Kembla (89.7%) and Wollongong (77.8%) are both located in the Wollongong region directly south of Sydney. 
 
Overall the data highlights the strength of value growth in Sydney and Melbourne over recent years.  Furthermore, it details just how moderate growth has generally been outside of these two cities.  Keep in mind that between them, Sydney and Melbourne account for an estimated 40.3% of the national population and 58.3% of the total value of dwellings nationally.  Given this, it really highlights the extent to which the performance of the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets will drive the national headline growth figures.

There are fewer homes scheduled to go to auction across the combined capital cities this week, after last week recorded the third busiest week for auctions so far this year.

CoreLogic is currently tracking 3,044 capital city auctions, down from the 3,438 held last week and also lower than the 3,207 auctions held one year ago.

Both Melbourne and Sydney, the two largest auction markets are set to host fewer auctions this week compared to last, with 1,520 Melbourne homes scheduled to go to auction and 1,080 scheduled auctions across Sydney, down from the 1,736 and 1,215 auctions held last week respectively.

Brisbane, Perth and Tasmania are all expected to see an increase in activity this week, while there are fewer auctions scheduled in Adelaide and Canberra.

Victoria has all of the busiest suburbs for auctions this week, with 22 homes scheduled to go to auction across Reservoir, followed by Doncaster East with 20 scheduled auctions, while Mount Waverley and St Albans will each host 19 auctions.

Summary of Last Week’s results

Last week, the combined capital cities saw auction volumes reach their third highest level this year, with a total of 3,438 held, returning a final auction clearance rate of 61.1 per cent.  This represented a slight increase from the week prior when a 60.9 per cent clearance rate was recorded across a slightly lower 3,390 auctions. One year ago, clearance rates were significantly higher over the corresponding period, with 73.0 per cent of auctions clearing, while the number of auctions held was similar (3,398).

Melbourne’s final auction clearance rate continued to soften last week, with 65.5 per cent of auctions clearing, surpassing the previous low seen two weeks prior when the final clearance rate dropped to its lowest seen since June 2016.  Volumes across the city were virtually unchanged week-on-week, with 1,736 held from 1,732 over the week prior when 66.9 per cent cleared. In Sydney, the final auction clearance rate recorded its fifth consecutive week below 60 per cent, however week-on-week results saw an increase in both volumes and the final clearance rate, with 1,215 auctions held and 56.8 per cent selling, up from the 54.8 per cent across 1,061 auctions.

Across the remaining capital cities, Brisbane was the only capital city to see an improvement in clearance rate last week.

Of the non-capital city regions, Geelong recorded the highest clearance rate, with 78.3 per cent of the 65 auctions successful.

"Housing markets are typically analysed by looking at the median which is the middle value.  By definition the median provides an idea of what a typical property is either selling for or valued at, but it is often forgotten there are as many properties worth less than the median as there are worth more.  By looking at different valuation percentiles we can get a much better idea of the range of housing costs across a geography.  

The 10th percentile value represents the lower end of a housing market while the 90th percentile indicates the most expensive ten per cent of properties.  Across the combined capital cities, the median dwelling values is $650,930 while the 10th percentile value is $350,723 and the 90th percentile value is $1,455,490.  The difference between the median and the 10th percentile value is -46.1% while the difference from the median to the 90th percentile is 123.6% which results in a range between the 10th and 90th percentile values of 315.0%.  Note that the broader this range the more diverse the cost of housing and the narrower the less diversity there is.

Let’s take a look across the capital cities.

Sydney

The 10th percentile value is $563,459 which is -37.8% lower than the median of $905,917.  The 90th percentile value is 113.8% higher than the median and 243.7% higher than the 10th percentile value and is recorded at $1,936,633.

Melbourne

The 90th percentile dwelling value is $1,474,777 which is 107.6% greater than the median of $710,420.  At $437,519 the 10th percentile value is -38.4% lower than the median while the 90the percentile value is 237.1% higher.

Brisbane

The median dwelling value is recorded at $490,525 while the 10th percentile value is $302,177 and the 90th percentile is $826,860.  The 10th percentile value is -38.4% lower than the median while the 90th percentile is 68.6% higher than the median and 173.6% higher than the 10th percentile.

Adelaide

The 90th percentile dwelling value ($746,497) is 73.5% greater than the median ($430,303) and 180.9% greater than the 10th percentile value ($265,730).  The 10th percentile value is -38.2% lower than the median.

Perth

With a median of $462,624, the 90th percentile value at $852,021 is 84.2% higher than the median.  The 90th percentile value is 184.7% higher than the 10th percentile value which at $299,293 is -35.3% lower than the median value.

Hobart

The 10th percentile value for the city is $234,337 which is -40.9% lower than the median ($396,393) and the 90th percentile value ($662,519) is 182.7% higher than the 10th percentile and 67.1% higher than the median.

Darwin

Tt $640,087 the 90th percentile dwelling value is 46.2% higher than the median ($437,910) and 112.0% higher than the 10th percentile value ($301,889).  The 10th percentile value is -31.1% lower than the median value.

Canberra

The median dwelling value currently sits at $582,882 while the 10th percentile value is $381,100 and the 90th percentile value is $919,436.  The 90th percentile value is 57.7% higher than the median and 141.3% higher than the 10th percentile value while the 10th percentile value is -34.6% lower than the median.

Across the capital cities, the 90th percentile dwelling value in all capital cities except for Melbourne and Canberra is lower than Sydney’s median value highlighting that for the typical Sydney dwelling, purchasers could be buying premium property for a similar cost in most other capital cities. 

 
Another trend to note is that in all capital cities the difference between the median and 10th percentile value is much smaller than the gap between the median and the 90th percentile value.  This indicates that lower value housing stock tends to be closer to the median than the expensive housing stock which tends to be much further away from the median value.  It highlights that in most cities while there is extremely expensive housing, there is not necessarily the same supply of extremely affordable housing.

Overall it is interesting to look at the range of housing costs across the city as it reiterates that despite the focus on medians there is a wide variety of housing in different shapes, sizes and values across the capital cities.

"There were 3,409 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities this week, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 66.9 per cent, overtaking last week as the third busiest week for auctions so far this year. Last week, based on final results, 60.9 per cent of the 3,390 auctions held recorded a successful result, the lowest clearance rate since late 2015/early 2016. Once final results are collected, the combined capital city clearance rate tends to revise down so at this stage it’s looking like the final clearance rate on Thursday will be in the mid to low 60 per cent range for the sixth week in a row. Sydney and Melbourne, the two largest auction markets, have seen clearance rates increase week-on-week after last week saw both cities recording their lowest clearance rates for the year so far, however as usual, these clearance rates will revise lower over the week. Over the same week last year, a total of 3,398 homes were taken to auction across the combined capital cities, and a clearance rate of 73.0 per cent was recorded. 

 

Across Melbourne, preliminary results show that 69.0 per cent of the 1,456 reported auctions sold this week, making it the third week in a row where the clearance rate has been below 70 per cent. There were 1,727 properties taken to auction across the city, compared to 1,732 last week when the final clearance rate slipped to 66.9 per cent, the lowest clearance rate the city has seen since July 2016. Over the same week last year, 1,616 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 76.1 per cent was recorded. Looking at the sub-regions of Melbourne, the Inner region was host to the highest number of auctions this week (317), followed by the West (255). The West also recorded the highest clearance rate (76.4 per cent across 212 results).

Sydney was host to 1,200 auctions this week and a preliminary clearance rate of 66.2 per cent was recorded, after last week saw the lowest clearance rate since late 2015/early 2016 when just 54.8 per cent of the 1,061 auctions recorded a successful result. The final clearance rate for Sydney has been sitting below 60 per cent for the last 4 weeks so it will be interesting to see what happens this week. This time last year, 77.1 per cent of the 1,262 homes taken to auction were sold. Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, the Sutherland (77.5 per cent), Eastern Suburbs (76.2 per cent), and Inner West (75.0 per cent) regions recorded the highest clearance rates. North Sydney and Hornsby was the busiest region with 205 homes taken to auction.

The preliminary clearance rate in Brisbane rose to 57.6 per cent across 152 auctions this week, from 46.7 per cent across 217 auctions last week, while this time last year 191 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 43.8 per cent was recorded. Meanwhile, across the Gold Coast, 41.0 per cent of the 39 reported auctions were successful.

In Adelaide, a 67.0 per cent preliminary result was recorded this week across 153 auctions. Last week, 151 Adelaide auctions returned a clearance rate of 64.5 per cent for the city, while at the same time last year, 144 homes were taken to auction, with 63.1 per cent recording a successful result.

Perth’s clearance rate of 38.9 per cent across 18 auction results is down from last week, when 85 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 39.7 per cent was recorded.  Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a lower 27.3 per cent, and 67 auctions were held.

Across Canberra, 128 homes were taken to auction this week. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 66.1 per cent, up from 62.8 per cent the previous week. 

Tasmania was host to 6 auctions this week and so far 3 results have been reported, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 33.3 per cent.

The combined capital cities are expected to see auction volumes over 3,000 for another week, with 3,124 homes currently scheduled to go under the hammer this week. 

This will be the 4th consecutive week where volumes have remained at these higher levels, which is not unusual this time of year with the end of Spring/ early Summer period traditionally recording a significant uplift in activity as the end of year approaches.

Auction activity across Melbourne is set to increase this week, with 1,717 homes scheduled for auction,

increasing on last week’s 1,647, while Sydney is expected to host fewer auctions this week compared to last, with 936 auctions to be held, down on last week’s 1,143 auctions.

All of the busiest suburbs for auctions are in Victoria this week. Topping the list with 29 homes scheduled for auction is Reservoir, following closely with 26 scheduled auctions each are Craigieburn and Richmond.

Summary of Last Week’s results

The combined capital city final auction clearance rate softened further last week, returning a 60.3 per cent rate of clearance across a lower volume of auctions over the week (3,291). Last week’s clearance rate is the lowest recorded not only this year, but the lowest since late 2015/ early 2016, down on the previous week’s 61.1 per cent when a higher volume of auctions were held (3,438).

Across Melbourne, the city has seen clearance rates continually decline each week over the last 4 weeks, with last week surpassing the previous as the lowest recorded since June 2016.  There were 1,647 Melbourne auctions held last week, returning a 65.4 per cent clearance rate, down slightly on the week prior when 1,736 auctions were held and 65.5 per cent cleared.

In Sydney, final results show that the clearance rate for the city fell to 56.2 per cent from 56.8 per cent the previous week. Auction volumes across the city were lower week-on-week, with 1,143 held, down from 1,215 the week prior.

Across the remaining capital cities, clearance rates improved in Canberra and Tasmania, while Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth’s final clearance rate fell last week.

The Geelong region was the busiest non-capital city region last week, with 86 auctions held returning a final auction clearance rate of 71.4 per cent.

"Recently, I did something that, ordinarily, you’re not supposed to do until you are at least heading for retirement and the kids have left home.  While I don’t as yet have children, my wife and I sold up our five bedroom house in the suburbs and with our dog, the three of us moved to a three bedroom apartment in the inner-city; the reactions have been somewhat interesting with some saying they wish they could bring themselves to do it, while others questioning the sense (particularly when I speak often about the unit oversupply in inner Brisbane).

So why did we do it?

When two people and a dog live in a five bedroom house, it’s a lot of work.  Not only do you have to keep the place clean but there are ongoing maintenance costs. My wife is Canadian and we both believe that people would be seeing plenty of friends and family travelling to Brisbane to see us so we needed a big house.  In all reality, it’s been somewhat different with our wedding being the only time we have had anyone stay with us.  Given this, you find yourself closing off and not using many rooms in the house.  

Added to the maintenance woes, I am not a handyman at all.  I mean I can change a tyre, tighten something with a screwdriver or a spanner and hammer a nail into the wall but that’s about it.  When you have a big house, particularly a ‘Queenslander’ as we had, there is a lot of work that goes along with that.  Furthermore, there is also lawn mowing and a garden to be done.  While mowing the lawn is pleasurable enough (as long as it isn’t every weekend in summer), neither my wife nor I have a particularly green thumb so the amount of work around the house can be tiresome.

Where we previously lived was also close to (across the River from) the Brisbane airport.  People say that you get used to traffic noise but I beg to differ.  In the four and a half years we lived in our house we noticed aircraft noise becoming increasingly disruptive and with a second runway being built at the airport we could only see it becoming worse.  In fact at certain times it was so disruptive that you could not even have a conversation nor hear the television despite how loud you put it up.

Obviously this is not a first-world problem, but for us, it was a big consideration in moving.  

With family overseas, my job requiring a lot of interstate travel it becomes a lot of work to organise for maintenance of a house while you are away.  The interstate travel also means that most of the housework needs to be done on the weekend when quite honestly, I would rather be doing almost anything else.

We have recently moved from our five bedroom house in Cannon Hill in Brisbane’s eastern suburbs to a three bedroom ground floor unit in West End in the inner city. Although we have much less space than in our Queenslander, we now have significantly more amenities close by, we can walk everywhere (if I wasn’t so lazy I could walk to work but the bus comes every five to ten minutes).  There are also plenty of pubs and restaurants close by and we are closer to work and the CBD.  Living in the inner city, we very rarely hear aircraft noise and, despite being surrounded by many other units, over the first two months, we have found our area to be extremely quiet.

The big question we have been asked is what happens if/when you have kids?  

My response to this is  that plenty of kids around the world grow up in smaller units than what we live in.  And, I’m not talking about undesirable cities either think of how many families live in the larger European and American cities, you see very few houses anywhere near the city centre.  We chose a unit of a good size, in a building which is predominately lived in by owner occupiers with onsite amenities and directly adjacent to parks and the river and nearby to schools.  

Although apartment living often gets a bad wrap (of which I have been guilty of myself in the past), the right product in the right location I have found to be extremely appealing. One of the reasons apartment living often gets frowned upon is because many buildings are not designed to think about the liveability, particularly as the owner’s lifecycle shifts. 
 
Over recent years many of the new inner-city unit developments have been very much targeted at investors with little consideration for someone that may want to buy and live in an apartment for the foreseeable future.  In saying that, when the right consideration is given to the product type, product size, the local amenities and the location there is no reason why apartment living should not be seen as a viable alternative to detached houses especially given that it generally comes at a much more affordable price point.  There is also no reason why increasing densities in a sensible manner in inner and middle ring suburbs should be as frowned upon as it is.  Sensible being the operative word which has not always been the case over recent years in many inner city areas.

"Dwelling value growth has slowed as demand from investor’s falls; is this just a coincidence or does it highlight just how reliant the housing market has become on demand from the investor segment?

Over the past five years, dwelling values nationally have increased by 39.3% largely driven by Sydney and Melbourne where values have increased by a much larger amount.  Similarly, over the most recent five years investors have committed to housing finance commitments totaling $695.6 billion.  

At their peak in May 2015, investors accounted for 54.8% of new (excluding refinances) mortgage demand which was an historic high.  With investor demand now slowing, falling a further -6.2% in September 2017 and dwelling values falling in the most investor-centric city (Sydney), what impact is the investor slowdown going to have on the broader housing market?  To try and determine, we shall take a look at investor housing demand across each state and territory.

NSW 

At their peak in May 2015, investors accounted for 63.6% of new mortgage demand which has since fallen to 50.3% in September 2017, its lowest proportion since December 2015 and well below its five year average of 55.6% of new mortgage commitments.

Vic

investors currently account for 43.2% of new mortgage demand which is well down from the May 2015 peak of 54.7% and below the five year average of 46.9%.

Qld

Investor activity peaked all the way back in 2007 when investors comprised 49.3% of mortgage demand.  Investors currently account for 34.3% of new mortgage lending which is lower than the five year average of 40.8%.

SA

Investor activity peaked at 47.5% of new mortgage lending in June 2015 and has reduced to 36.9% in September 2017.  Over the past five years, investors have accounted for an average of 39.8% of new mortgage lending each month.

WA 

Investor participation peaked all the way back in December 2008 at 49.8% of new mortgage lending.  Over the past five years, investors have averaged 38.1% of new mortgage lending and were recorded at 33.6% in September 2017.

Tas

Over the past five years, investors have averaged 30.3% of new mortgage demand in the state while in September 2017 investors accounted for a slightly higher 33.3% of new mortgage demand.

NT

After peaking at 61.5% of new mortgage demand in June 2014, investors have slumped to just 34.1% of demand in September 2017 which is much lower than the five year average of 49.2%.

ACT

Investors currently account for 38.2% of new mortgage demand which is lower than the five year average of 43.0% and much lower than the historic high of 50.4% all the way back in June 2000.

The data shows that as mortgage demand from investors, particularly in NSW, has slowed, so too has the rate of value growth.  In fact, Sydney dwelling values are now falling as investor demand continues to fade. Melbourne has also seen value growth slow although not to the same magnitude as Sydney however, investor participation over recent years in Vic has not been as significant as in NSW.  Outside of NSW and Vic, investors have not been the most significant source of new mortgage housing demand over recent years.

A similar trend was evident when credit conditions were tightened after the first round of APRA’s macroprudential policy changes through 2015 and early 2016.

With investor demand continuing to reduce due to tighter credit conditions, low yields and affordability constraints, it is reasonable to expect that this will have the greatest impact on NSW housing markets followed by those in Vic.  Elsewhere, the changing landscape may slow markets a little but other states and territories have largely seen demand over recent years driven by owner occupiers.  If anything, the lack of value growth in these market, superior affordability and less demand from investors may make buying conditions slightly more favourable for owner occupiers.

This time last year, 2,987 homes were taken to auction and a clearance rate of 74.4 per cent was recorded. The final clearance rate has remained below 65 per cent for the last 4 weeks and it’s likely that this will be the case again on Thursday when the final results are released. One of the biggest contributors to the softer auction market conditions is Sydney, where the final clearance rate has remained below 60 per cent since the last week of October, while Melbourne has slipped below 70 per cent for the second week in a row. 

Melbourne was host to 1,717 auctions this week and a preliminary clearance rate of 69.6 per cent was recorded, making it the second busiest week for auctions in Melbourne this year. Last week saw the final clearance rate drop to 69.2 per cent across 1,296 auctions, the lowest clearance rate the city has seen since the beginning of July 2016. One year ago, 1,303 auctions were held across Melbourne and 79.4 per cent were successful. Looking at the sub-regions of Melbourne, 4 of the 9 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 70.0 per cent with the stand outs being the Mornington Peninsula (82.8 per cent), North West (78.1 per cent), and West (76.8 per cent) regions. 

Across Sydney, preliminary results show that 61.5 per cent of the 756 reported auctions sold this week. There were 1,035 properties taken to auction across the city, down from 1,102 last week when the final clearance rate was recorded at 58.5 per cent. Over the same week last year, 1,082 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 79.6 per cent was recorded. Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, North Sydney and Hornsby had both the highest number of auctions this week (154), and the strongest rate of clearance, recording a preliminary clearance rate of 72.4 per cent. 

The preliminary clearance rate in Brisbane rose to 49.6 per cent across 213 auctions this week, from 44.1 per cent across 209 auctions last week, while this time last year 262 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 45.2 per cent was recorded. Meanwhile, across the Gold Coast, 39.2 per cent of the 51 reported auctions were successful.

In Adelaide, a 66.3 per cent preliminary result was recorded this week across 146 auctions. Last week, 128 Adelaide auctions returned a clearance rate of 62.0 per cent for the city, while at the same time last year, 137 homes were taken to auction, with 66.0 per cent recording a successful result.

Perth’s clearance rate of 60.0 per cent across 25 auction results is up from last week, when 40 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 50.0 per cent was recorded. Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a lower 38.1 per cent, and 73 auctions were held.

Across Canberra, 130 homes were taken to auction this week. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 67.6 per cent, down from 69.7 per cent the previous week. 

Tasmania was host to 15 auctions this week and so far 7 results have been reported, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 85.7 per cent.

"Over recent weeks, auction clearance rates across the nation’s two largest housing markets (Sydney and Melbourne) have been significantly lower than they were 12 months ago however, they haven’t necessarily been all that much lower than the previous years.  While comparing auction volumes and clearance rates to a year ago is valuable, it is much more valuable to look at how these metrics compare across a number of years.

Auction clearance rates in Melbourne are currently substantially lower than they were a year ago.  In fact, the clearance rate of 66.9% last week was the lowest since July of last year.  Although clearance rates are lower than they were a year ago, they are at fairly similar levels to what was being recorded at the same time of year in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  The chart really highlights just how much stronger the auction market in Melbourne was a year ago relative to other recent years.

 
The volume of properties being taken to auction, particularly over recent months, has generally been higher than over recent years.  By comparison, in 2016 when clearance rates were much higher than they have been this year, the number of properties being taken to auction was relatively lower than over recent years.  The higher number of properties being taken to auction is likely to be having some impact on the weaker clearance rates this year relative to last however, volumes are also much higher currently than they were in 2013, 2014 and 2015 a time at which clearance rates were fairly similar to current levels.  Given this, clearance rates are actually holding up quite well considering much higher volumes of auctions.

Sydney

Auction clearance rate in Sydney have been at their lowest levels since 2012 over recent weeks and have been on a steady decline throughout 2017.  If you exclude the low volumes in January, last week’s auction clearance rate of 54.8% was the cities lowest clearance rate since December 2015.  Clearance rates have not been consistently as low at this time of year since 2012.  Clearance rates are substantially lower than they were a year ago and are also slightly lower than they were two years ago when APRAs first round of macroprudential policies were significantly impacting Sydney housing demand.  If the previous round of macroprudential policies is a guide we can expect a further weakening of clearance rates over the coming weeks.

 
Unlike Melbourne, Sydney is not seeing a substantially higher number of properties being taken to auction compared to recent years.  In fact over recent weeks there has been an equivalent number of auctions across the city to volumes last year when clearance rates were much higher than they are currently, while there have been fewer auctions than in 2015 when clearance rates were similarly weak.  

There has been clear evidence over recent weeks that auction clearance rates have softened in Sydney and Melbourne.  The falling clearance rates in Sydney are occurring on similar volumes of auctions to recent years but matches the recent declines in dwelling values.  In Melbourne, auction clearance rates have slowed and there has also been a moderate slowdown in value growth.  The big difference in Melbourne has been that auction volumes have been much higher so it is difficult to know if the weaker clearance rates are because of the market overall or due to their being too much stock being put up for auction each week.  Keep in mind that clearance rates typically soften through Spring as auction volumes increase so we may have to wait until 2018 to truly understand what is driving the apparent weakness in the Melbourne auction market.

Published: 27 November 2017",2021_04_23,27-Nov-17,NSW VIC,What Is Driving The Softening Auction Clearance Rates In Sydney & Melbourne?
"Depending on your age, your attitudes and beliefs around the issue of housing affordability are likely to be very different.

That’s a key take-home message from CoreLogic’s Perceptions of Housing Affordability Report 2017, which broke respondents down into three generational categories - Millennials (aged 18-34), Gen X (aged 34-49) and Baby Boomers (aged 50-64). 

At the very outset, the difference in levels of property ownership across the generations was marked, with 34% of Millennials currently owning property compared to 62% of Gen X and 68% of Baby Boomers. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the amount of time they’ve had to pay off a mortgage, Baby Boomers were most likely to own a property outright (37%) compared with 13% for Gen X and just 9% for Millennials.

The value of ownership

The survey shows that while home ownership is important across all generations, the degree of that importance drops off somewhat with age. Of the Millennials who are either renting or living at home, 96% stated it was important while 61% stated it was very important. Among Gen X, 87% stated it was important while 53% labeled it as very important. Meantime, 73% of Baby Boomers believed it was important while 40% considered it very important.

When it came to actual housing affordability, levels of concern are extraordinarily high across all generations. Amongst those who don’t currently own a property, 95% of Millennials are worried about being able to afford either their first home or their next home, with 50% describing themselves as very concerned. This compares with 86% of Gen Xers (54% of whom are very concerned) and 72% of Baby Boomers (45% of whom are very concerned).

Fear for the future

Anxiety levels remain significant even once a property has been purchased, with 91% of Millennials worried they’ll not be able to afford their next move, compared with 77% of Gen X and 64% of Baby Boomers. 

Millennials, however, appear slightly less gloomy about how housing affordability is tracking. When compared with last year, 29% believe housing affordability is worse now. In contrast, 38% of Gen X feel that affordability is worse now than it was a year ago, with 40% of Baby Boomers sharing the same sentiment.

Gloominess about future affordability similarly increases with age, with 54% of Millennials believing the situation will be even worse next year, compared with 59% of Generation X and 64% of Baby Boomers.

The cause of the pain?

Interestingly, obstacles to housing affordability are perceived very differently across the generations. In order of importance, Millennials are most likely to find having the deposit (49%), interest rates (44%), and a combination of employment certainty and loan approval (41% each) to be the biggest impediments. This compares with 48% of Gen X who believe that stamp duty is a major impediment, followed by foreign buyer influence and the difficulty of raising a deposit (45% each), as well as employment certainty (40%). Baby Boomers identified foreign investors (31%) and stamp duty (29%) as the biggest issues.

Solutions and strategies

On the subject of the best strategies for improving housing affordability, Millennials are the most likely (68%) to believe that a well-paying and secure job is the greatest help when buying a first home, compared with 58% of Gen X and 49% of Baby Boomers. 

When it comes to stamp duty, 80% of Baby Boomers said its reduction or removal for first homebuyers would be helpful, while 69% of Millennials and 71% of Gen X agreed. Baby Boomers are also more likely than other generations to feel that a reduction in the number of migrants would be an effective affordability improvement strategy (56%), compared with 51% of Gen X and 47% of Millennials.

"Earlier this month CoreLogic released their October 2017 home value index results. This week, we focus on what these results look like across the regional housing markets.

According to the CoreLogic home value index results for October 2017, dwelling values across the combined regional housing markets of the country were unchanged over the month.  While dwelling values were flat, they fell by -0.1% over the quarter and were 4.9% higher over the past 12 months.  The quarterly decline in values was the largest fall since the three months to October 2014 while the 4.9% annual change was the lowest annual change since February 2017.

While the data indicates that the rate of dwelling value growth is slowing, there are some differences occurring across the regional markets of the states and territories.

Regional NSW

Dwelling values increased by 0.2% in October 2017 to be 0.7% higher over the three months to October 2017 and 9.7% higher over the past year.  Monthly, quarterly and annual growth rates are slowing however, regional NSW has recorded faster annual growth than Sydney over the past two months.

Regional Vic

The 0.3% increase in values in October was the greatest monthly increase since April of this year.  Over the past three months, values are -0.3% lower while over the past year they have increased by 4.4%.  At 4.4% annual growth, the regional areas of Vic are growing at a much slower pace than Melbourne where values are 11.0% higher over the year.

Regional Qld

Dwelling values were -0.2% lower over the month however, they fell by -0.5% over the quarter and were 1.6% higher over the past year.  Regional Qld dwelling value growth has continued to underperform the quite moderate growth in Brisbane as regions outside of the south-east corner continue to drag on the performance.

Regional SA

Dwelling values fell by -0.5% over the month, were -2.1% lower over the quarter and -0.9% lower over the past year.  While dwelling values are increasing at a moderate pace in Adelaide, outside of the capital city housing demand is much weaker leading to value falls.

Regional WA

While Perth values have not fallen for two months, in Regional WA, dwelling values fell -0.4% in October, they were -1.4% lower over the quarter and -3.0% lower over the year.  This indicates that regional WA values have fallen at a slightly faster pace than Perth values over the past year.

Regional Tas

Values were 0.3% higher in October 2017, -0.4% lower over the three months to October and 5.4% higher over the year.  Although annual value growth was much slower than in Hobart, it has accelerated from an increase of 1.7% a year ago.

Regional NT

Values rose by 1.1% over the month to be 0.7% higher over the past three months and 1.3% higher over the year.  Although growth is still minimal, it is significantly greater than the -5.7% fall in Darwin values over the year.

Growth in regional dwelling values generally continues to lag capital cities however, in most states the growth in values of regional property markets are generally stronger than they have been over recent years.

"This week, there were 2,894 auctions held across the combined capital cities returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 66.5 per cent, increasing on last week when the final auction clearance rate fell to its lowest reading since early 2016, when 61.5 per cent of the 2,045 auctions cleared. Clearance rates have continued to track below 70 per cent since June the year; this is a considerably softer trend than what was seen over the same period last year when clearance rates were tracking around the mid 70 per cent range for most of the second half 2016.  Results across each of the individual markets were varied this week, with Canberra recording the highest preliminary auction clearance rate of 72.9 per cent, while in Brisbane only 45.7 per cent of auctions cleared. 

Across Australia’s largest auction market Melbourne, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 71.4 per cent was recorded across 1,299 auctions this week, down from last week’s final clearance rate of 74.3 per cent across a much lower volume of auctions (318). Over the same week last year, 1,329 homes were taken to auction across Melbourne and a clearance rate of 76.8 per cent was recorded. The Inner region of Melbourne held the most auctions this week (207), with a preliminary clearance rate of 66.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the strongest clearance rate was recorded across the West region with an 82.2 per cent success rate across 189 auctions.

Sydney returned a preliminary auction clearance rate of 64.4 per cent this week, rising from last week’s 59.8 per cent, while one year ago 81.4 per cent of Sydney homes taken to auction were successful. Auction volumes decreased week-on-week, with 1,089 auctions held this week, down from the 1,232 held last week, while one year ago the exact same volume of auctions was recorded (1,089). The Ryde sub-region of Sydney recorded the highest preliminary clearance rate this week, with 88.6 per cent of the 49 auctions held reporting as sold, while the North Sydney and Hornsby region held the most auctions (196), with 66.1 per cent clearing.

The preliminary auction clearance rate across Brisbane this week was 45.7 per cent, down from 47.7 per cent over the week prior. Auction volumes were higher this week with 209 auctions held, up from 169 last week. Meanwhile, across the Gold Coast, 52.9 per cent of the 34 reported auctions were successful. 

This week, Adelaide saw a preliminary clearance rate of 65.0 per cent across a total of 126 auctions, increasing slightly from the previous weeks 64.1 per cent across 129 auctions. One year ago, 133 auctions were held with 67.3 per cent clearing.

Perth’s clearance rate of 61.9 per cent across 39 auctions is up from the previous week, when 48 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 44.1 per cent was recorded.  Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a lower 37.5 per cent, and 43 auctions were held.

In Canberra, 125 auctions were held this week returning a 72.9 per cent preliminary clearance rate. Last week, 148 auctions were held and the clearance rate was a lower 66.7 per cent. Over the same week last year, 97 auctions held and a clearance rate of 76.2 per cent was recorded.

There were 7 Tasmanian auctions held this week, of the 4 results collected half reported as sold.

"The real estate industry has always had a love hate relationship with the portals. While it’s the portals that own the best audience for property buyers – and are therefore an important part of any vendor’s marketing spend – the charging models and sense of dependence has always irked agents. No-one likes being obliged to pay for a service you feel you have little control over. 

But the portals and the technology that drives them are now more than 15 years old. And over the past 3 years, the game they changed has started to change again. It’s possible the portals are about to be disrupted themselves.

Fifteen years ago, the idea that buyers could go to one place online to see every property on the market in any suburb you chose was absolutely revolutionary. Buyers no longer had to jump in the car and visit the suburb to check out local real estate agent shop windows or get hold of a local paper. All the information you needed was in one place, and you could look at it at whatever time suited you – 9am, 9pm, 2pm, 2am – on your desktop computer in the comfort of your office or living room and send a message of inquiry. It was a huge improvement in the old way of doing things, removing pain points and making property hunting faster and more convenient. 

But two new revolutions have occurred over roughly the past three to five years – the social revolution and the mobile revolution. The two are interconnected as the conversion of our mobile phones to mobile computers that are always on and always with us in turn enabled the social revolution with apps such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Messenger, LinkedIn, Pinterest and WhatsApp to dominate our lives.

And it’s apps like Facebook that are likely to dramatically change the way we ‘do’ real estate again in the very near future. 

Facebook claims to be a company based on “human connection and bringing people together”, the recent REIQ Tech Day was told. Its mission is to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”.

There are 2.01b people on Facebook every month and 1.32b on Facebook every day. Facebook is the eighth most-used feature on any mobile phone and in addition to the mothership, there are 1.2b on Whatsapp, 1.2b on Messenger and 700m people on Instagram each month – all part of the Facebook family.
The only thing bigger than the Facebook community, the conference was told, is Christianity.

Facebook also has a second mission – to “democratise advertising” by making it easy and affordable for every business – especially small businesses – to reach customers by giving them access to the same tools that big business has traditionally dominated.

This is where the threat to the portals happens. 

Because Facebook is not really just a cool entertainment app that allows you to see photos of friends new babies, hashtag all the blessings in your life, rage against the latest political upset or message your husband with a virtual cat on your head (or is that just me and my guy?). Facebook is a major big data play. 

Every interaction we have with Facebook captures information about us as individuals – our likes, our passions, our friends, key events in our lives, our behaviour, how we feel, our recommendations, who our friends are and their likes, passions, events and behaviour. Every interaction builds up a more and more detailed picture of us individually which is what makes the Facebook advertising algorithms and their ability to target so powerful. We don’t really see or feel this. When the algorithm is doing its job, the result is simply more content that we’re genuinely interested in.

There is absolutely no need to ‘spray and pray’ your advertising as a business in Facebook. If your ideal customer is a 36 year old woman with two primary school age children who loves shoes and wine and drives a four wheel drive and works part time and who lives in a 3 bedroom house, you can find her and thousands like her and target your message exactly to her. Knowing this, if you’ve got a beautiful 4 bedroom house in her area with a walk-in wardrobe, wine cellar, great kid friendly outdoor area with a pool and large garage that would be perfect, you can easily target advertising directly to her (and her friends). 

It doesn’t matter that she’s not on Realestate.com.au or Domain.com.au looking yet. It doesn’t matter that she may not have thought (as far as you’re aware) that she should move up. You can plant the seed in her mind. You can show her what’s possible through Facebook targeted advertising and encourage her to move from a passive buyer (one who has not thought about buying or selling at all) to become a researcher or an active buyer or seller (one who decides that now is the time to act).

This is part one of the strengths that Facebook has over the portals; using it you can target people and move them into your contact funnel before they have even decided that moving is the right decision for them. You have the power to target and influence their behaviour. 

But it doesn’t stop there.

Part two of Facebook’s strength is only now starting to be witnessed. As Facebook’s ability to capture and process data about us accelerates at speeds that are truly mind blowing, its capability for predictive analytics becomes ridiculously powerful. Soon, Facebook won’t just be able to target people because they match a profile of someone who might be interested in buying, selling or renting because you select them. Soon, Facebook will be able to target people because their behaviour on Facebook and its associated apps, signal that they are actively engaging in behaviour that pre-empts buying, selling or renting behaviour in addition to their profile. This behaviour may include things like renovating, finding tradespeople, reaching out to real estate agents, buying paint or asking friends for real estate recommendations, – the possibilities and their combinations are endless. In such a scenario, you’ll get recommendations on who to target based on data that’s defining what they’re likely to do next, not options they’ve chosen, or things they’ve already done.

And that leads us to this new world order of being able to target people based on their profile, behaviour and a likelihood of intention much higher up the sales funnel, rather than waiting for a potential customer to go onto a real estate website and make an inquiry.  

Which leads to the question of why do you need a real estate portal – a special place to go to find a property to buy – if properties that need buying will serve themselves up to you just when you’re starting to think about the possibility of moving? 

In this new world, the power any real estate portal can wield diminishes and the value proposition to a portal customer is impacted. Why should I put so much of my advertising budget into reaching people who are actively in the market looking, when I can put the budget into Facebook and target both those who are actively looking, and those who are passive, but whose behaviour indicates that with the right property, they could change at any minute? No wonder the portals are worried. 

So how as a real estate agent do you get yourself ready for this next exciting stage? Here’s 4 things you can do:

1.    Get serious about social now

Social is no longer something the receptionist can do in her spare time, or have your teenage kids help you as a hobby. Make it someone’s job in your business to understand thoroughly how targeting works in social media, who your target audience is for the different types of properties you sell and services you offer, and set aside a small budget to start practising the best ways to reach them and the content that works. Upload your database to create a matching audience in Facebook.

2.    Learn about geo-targeting and targeting by property features

Kick it up a notch by learning about advanced topics such as geo targeting (X people matching Y description within Z km of my office) and targeting people by property features which you know are in demand, or which signal they may be interested in making the next move. ie: People in their 50s who have owned their properties for 20+ years may be ready to downsize, or be looking for an investment. Families in 2 bedroom apartments may be looking for 3 bedroom houses or larger apartments. Ask yourself, “If I was this person, what kind of information in my Facebook feed would I find interesting?” 

3.    Improve your content

Social media is about human relationships, community and helping – it’s about being useful, not boastful. And Facebook advise that your content needs to be striking, and get attention quickly – in the first three seconds, otherwise it is scrolled past. Evergreen content on how the property market works, tips for buyers and sellers and walking people through the process of moving are all ways you can connect with people while also establishing yourself as an expert who knows their stuff. A constant stream of properties for sale will only be appreciated by those who are actively looking (in which case they’re probably on a portal already) but an occasional inspirational property well targeted as part of a broader spectrum of useful content sends a more trustworthy message.

4.    Experiment with different content styles

Writing a post and sticking up a photo is the easiest way to post, but Facebook rewards those who innovate. Video, slideshows and Facebook Live are prioritised by the algorithm which means your message reaches more of the right people for less money. And don’t forget most people snack on social content while they’re doing something else, so all video should be captioned. No one sticks on earphones so they can listen to a 90 second video on the bus. Whatever you post, make sure you analyse its reach and engagement levels each time so you can work out what works best for your audience.

So if you’re one of those agents who rage against the portals, don’t despair, a change is coming. But it also means you’ll need to change your behaviour. Real estate is just one of the hundreds of consumer experiences that Facebook and the social universe is completely opening up  right now. There is plenty of opportunity for real estate agents who get stuck in and recognise the opportunity – but just like 15 years ago, fortune will favour the brave.

 ",2021_04_23,8-Nov-17,N/A,Facebook & Real Estate: Why The Portals Are Worried
"A recent national property seller sentiment survey conducted by OpenAgent, a comparison and real estate agent referral platform company, and in conjunction with hosts, onthehouse.com.au, (a CoreLogic business) unveiled a plethora of insights from property sellers around market expectations when selling a property in today’s market.  

Of the 8,000 responses from 3,185 individual recipients who opted into the survey over the past 11 months to September, one of the key take outs when asked ‘Where do you expect home prices to be in your area in six months’ time?’ delivered some interesting observations; it appears that despite gro wing concerns that the property market may see a downturn, recipients held an optimistic outlook about property prices.   

 
Marta Higuera, OpenAgent co-founder and co-CEO said “A key takeout from the survey was Perth, which, after years of delivering lacklustre property activity, finally looks to be making a comeback.”   “The survey also revealed that there has been a significant shift from a pessimistic to an optimistic homeowner sentiment. On the flipside, the survey confirmed that Sydney’s property price confidence has been slowly eroding since the beginning of the year, making Melbourne the leading capital city in terms of pricing outlook (as seen by homeowners).” 
 

Commenting on behalf of onthehouse.com.au, David Maire said, “The findings in the survey provide timely and indepth insights into market activity at the coal-face. We’re looking forward to delivering more sentiment data over time and with our survey partner, Open Agent.” 

Seller Sentiment Snapshot:  

(Index operates on a scale of -10 to +10 where a reading of 0 is a neutral view, +5 being strong optimism, and -5 strong pessimism). 

National:   
A relative low in consumer sentiment appeared in the index from 2017 Q2 into Q3, with readings between +3.6 and +3.7 for the four consecutive months; a drop from higher index values of at least +4.0 recorded during January, March, and April 2017.  
The +3.9 reading in September showed a slight bounce back due to the arrival of spring. 
State:   
NSW continued to show a decline from its peak at +6.5 in January 2017 – some fluctuation occurred in Q3 with values of +4.2 in July, +4.9 in August, and a low +3.8 in September.
In Victoria, index values hovered around +5.5 during 2017 with an occasional spike downward but no clear trend.  
 
Capital cities:  
The diverging states of the markets around Australia are well highlighted by capital city sentiment index values with Melbourne now the clear winner on price growth expectation at +5.4, Sydney with a value of +4.2, is just above Adelaide on +3.9 and Brisbane on +3.8. 
Perth still holds the weakest market of the mainland capitals with an index value of +1.2. 
Metro vs. Regional Vendor Sentiment:  
Although metro areas have received more positive vendor sentiment than regional areas, the latest quarter suggests the gap may be closing.
Metro areas collectively had a step down in sentiment in Q2 and the index level has stayed flat in Q3, with values of +4.3 in July, +3.9 in August, and +4.2.

"High house prices are not only making ownership increasingly unattainable - they’re also forcing many adult-aged children to remain firmly ensconced within the parental nest for indefinite periods. 

A quick look at the results from CoreLogic’s Perceptions of Housing Affordability Report 2017 indicates the depth of resulting frustration, with 62% of people living at home saying they can’t afford to move out. 

According to the data, this scenario is increasingly applying to children aged in their 20s and even 30s. And sadly for beleaguered mums and dads everywhere, it appears there’s no end to the pain in sight.

Flying the nest later than many would like

The situation differs from state to state. Queenslanders (38%) and ACT residents (32%) are more likely to move out of the family home before the age of 25, while moving out of home before the age of 35 seems to have become the new norm in other states. 

Indeed, the research shows that 77% of those living at home in South Australia and the Northern Territory will move out before age 35. In Queensland, NSW and Victoria, this figure drops to 75%, 71% and 69% respectively. Tasmanians are the least decided about when they will move out, with 46% declaring they ‘did not know’.

While there is a range of reasons for this considerable stay-at-home trend, it’s clear that the cost of housing, or rather, the cost of saving to enter the market, is a major catalyst. 

In this regard, 27% of respondents indicated that their extended home stay is geared towards saving a home deposit. Of those who live with parents, 28% of Millennials say that they’re working towards this goal, compared with 19% of Gen X and 25% of Baby Boomers. 

Why leaving home hurts so much

The CoreLogic data also indicates just why so many are opting to stay at home for far longer than in previous generations. By every measure, housing affordability in Australia has become more of a challenge over the past 15-years. 

Consider this: the cost of buying a house currently takes 7.2 times the annual income of a typical household. That’s up from 4.2 times the annual income 15-years-ago. It also takes 1.53-years of household income to save for a 20% home deposit. 

Moreover, servicing a typical loan of 80% of house value now requires 39% of household income compared with 25% back in 2001. In short, home ownership is quickly becoming the privilege of high-income earners who are being forced to assign ever-increasing levels of expenditure to mortgage servicing.

There’s a good chance that those who are staying at home have also noted the plight of other home-owning hopefuls who have actually moved out of the family nest and into a pre-buying rental phase. 

Tellingly, their situation offers an insight into the affordability and payment stress that typically results once home ownership is finally achieved. 

A third or more of renters in each state believe they’ll need to sink more than the traditional 30% of their income into their mortgage when they eventually attain one. This is roughly aligned with the perception of affordability in each state. According to the CoreLogic research, renters in NSW (48%) are more likely to be willing to dedicate between 30 to 49% of their income to servicing a mortgage, compared with 45% in Queensland, 41% in WA and 37% in Victoria.

"Throughout Spring, the number of properties advertised for sale typically climbs as vendors look to take advantage of the warmer climate and improved weather.  This year, as housing market conditions transition, stock levels remain tight across the strongest markets but are rising in areas where housing market conditions are softening. 

CoreLogic measures the amount of advertised stock on the market on a rolling 28 day basis.  Advertised stock levels are a unique count meaning that listings are matched to properties and when a property is advertised in more than one place it is only counted once.  It is important to note that typically these counts are more reflective of the established housing market rather than off-the-plan where stock often isn’t individually advertised.

Across the nation CoreLogic is currently tracking 226,007 properties advertised for sale which is -5.3% lower than a year ago and well down on levels at this time of the year for the past five years.  Across the combined capital cities, total stock advertised for sale is 1.0% higher than it was a year ago with 110,909 properties advertised over the past 28 days.  Looking at stock at this time of year across the combined capital cities there is more stock currently for sale than there has been each year since 2013.  By comparing capital city and national data it indicates that the amount of stock for sale in the regional markets is substantially lower than it has been over recent years.  The combined regional markets account for 50.9% of total listings, its lowest proportion of national listings since December 2011.

Across the individual capital cities the data varies quite substantially.

Sydney

Currently has 25,625 properties advertised for sale which is 19.5% higher than a year ago.  In comparison to the same time over recent years, the amount of stock on the market is now higher than each of the past four years.

Melbourne 

With 30,570 properties advertised for sale stock levels are -1.7% lower than a year ago.  The volume of stock for sale is lower for this time of year than any of the past 5 years.

Brisbane

The number of properties advertised for sale is 2.5% higher than a year ago with 20,611 properties currently on the market.  Compared to this time of year over the past five years, listings are at their highest level since 2012 however, they are -15.2% lower than 2012 levels.

Adelaide

With 8,794 properties for sale, listings are 8.0% higher than a year ago and at their highest levels for this time of year since 2013 although they are -7.7% lower than 2013 levels.

Perth 

The 20,309 properties for sale in Perth is -14.3% lower than a year ago however, it is also 1.6% higher than volumes at this time of year two years ago.

Hobart

With 1,157 properties for sale across the city the volume of stock for sale -33.6% lower than a year ago and at its lowest level over each of the past five years.  In fact Hobart stock for sale is -54.7% lower than it was two years ago.

Darwin

The 1,581 properties advertised for sale is -1.9% lower than a year ago however, stock levels remain elevated.  In fact stock for sale is 73.0% higher than it was in 2012.

Canberra

The 2,262 properties advertised for sale currently is 14.4% more than there were a year ago.  The number of properties for sale is up on 2015 and 2016 levels.

Based on the data listings trends vary significantly across the country.  Hobart, which is the housing market with the strongest value growth has seen a dramatic fall in listings over recent years.  Meanwhile, values have fallen over the year in Perth and Darwin and each of these cities is seeing heightened stock levels.  Sydney has seen a rapid slowdown in growth over recent months and at the same time the volume of stock for sale has increased relative to recent years.  In Melbourne, value growth remains relatively strong (although it has slowed a little) and the volume of stock for sale remains lower than over recent years.  The data highlights that the stock for sale (supply) does have a fairly significant impact on the change in dwelling values.  As stock increases, growth slows and as stock falls growth has accelerated.

"Upcoming auctions

This week, there are fewer auctions scheduled to take place across the combined capital cities, with 1,862 currently being tracked by CoreLogic, this is half the volume of auctions recorded last week when the combined capitals saw the highest volume of auctions recorded since late 2015 (3,713).

Across Melbourne, auction activity is expected to fall this week; the lower volumes is likely due to the upcoming Melbourne cup festivities and coming off the back of the highest week for auctions ever recorded for the city.  There are only 258 Melbourne homes scheduled to go to auction this week, down from the 1,983 last week. 

Activity across Sydney is set to remain relatively steady week-on-week, with 1,148 auctions scheduled to take place, decreasing by 6 per cent on last week’s final figures which saw 1,215 auctions held.

Across the remaining capital cities, auction activity is expected to decrease across Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and Tasmania, while Canberra will see volumes rise.

Due to the low activity in Victoria this week, all of the busiest suburbs for auctions are in New South Wales, with 26 Mosman homes scheduled to go under the hammer, followed by Randwick (20), St Ives (18) and Vaucluse (14).

Summary of Last Week’s results

"Preliminary clearance rates hold firm as volumes across the combined capital cities reach their highest level year-to-date and Melbourne records its busiest auction week on record.

This week, the combined capital cities saw the number of auctions held reach a new year-to-date high, with a total of 3,690 held, surpassing the previous 2017 high recorded over the week prior to Easter when 3,517 auctions were held. The higher volumes returned a preliminary auction clearance rate of 67.8 per cent, rising from a final clearance rate of 64.7 per cent last week, when fewer auctions were held (2,519).  This week’s surge in volumes can be attributed to activity across Australia’s largest auction market in Melbourne, where volumes across the city reached their highest on record this week, with 1,983 held recording a preliminary auction clearance rate of 71.7 per cent. Sydney also saw a substantially higher volume of auctions this week with 1,196 homes taken to auction, recording a clearance rate of 64.1 per cent.  Sydney’s clearance rate has been consistently below 65 per cent since the first week of October.  Activity across the remaining auction markets was varied with Brisbane recording the lowest preliminary clearance rate (47.1 per cent).  Historically auction volumes have peaked around late November / early December; if this trend holds true this year, we could see new records being set for auction volumes as the Spring season concludes.

The number of Melbourne homes taken to auction this week reached a record high, with a total of 1,983 held, returning a preliminary auction clearance rate of 71.7 per cent. This week is not only the highest year-to-date for the city, but the highest volume of auctions we have on record; with this week surpassing the previous peak over the week ending 29 Nov, 2015 when 1,876 auctions were held. Over the corresponding week last year, volumes were substantially lower, when 632 auctions were held and a 77.5 per cent rate of clearance was recorded. Across the sub-regions of Melbourne, Mornington Peninsula recorded the highest clearance rate with 80.4 per cent of the 69 auctions successful, while the Inner region hosted the most auctions (354).

Sydney’s preliminary auction clearance rate this week was 64.1 per cent across a higher volume of auctions week-on-week, with 1,196 held across the city, increasing from 61.3 per cent last week when 823 auctions were held. Over the same week one year ago, 1,100 homes were taken to auction across Sydney and a clearance rate of 80.5 per cent was recorded. North Sydney and Hornsby hosted the most auctions of any Sydney sub-region this week, with 192 properties taken to auction. The preliminary clearance rate for the region is 69.8 per cent across 139 results. 

There were 188 Brisbane auctions this week returning a preliminary clearance rate of 47.1 per cent, virtually unchanged from 47.0 per cent last week across 174 auctions and higher than one year ago when there were 192 auctions with a success rate of 46.6 per cent. The Gold Coast’s preliminary clearance rate was 44.9 per cent across 49 results this week. 

A total of 143 Adelaide homes were taken to auction this week, with a preliminary clearance rate of 70.0 per cent, down from 61.9 per cent last week when 148 auctions were held across the city. 

There were 46 Perth auctions this week, with 54.5 per cent clearing, rising from last week when 44 auctions were held and 40.0 per cent cleared.

"You may not even be aware of it, but chances are, you could be putting your financial future in jeopardy by making these deadly property investment mistakes.

We’re not talking about the classic mistakes such as not doing your research before buying.

In fact, it’s in doing the research that could cost you the biggest financial pain. That’s because this where a lot of investors commit their biggest missteps.

Therefore, becoming aware of these mistakes is important if you want to avoid losing your hard-earned cash.

4 deadly investment mistakes you must avoid at all cost
Investment mistake #1. Making a strategy fit an area

Having a strategy is important if you want to succeed as an investor. However, rigidly sticking with the strategy rather than focusing on the result can have costly consequences.

For example, if you’re pursuing a renovate for profit strategy and are looking to invest in Moreton Bay in Queensland, you’re likely to be targeting 30 years old unrenovated homes. But this type of property isn’t what the demographics of that area want. These people have dual income, high-paying jobs. They want a 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom, double lockup garage house. They want a relatively brand new or up to five-years old property, not a renovated 30 years old property.

Therefore, it’s crucial to really understand the demographics of an area and what’s in demand to ensure you’re buying the right product.

Investment mistake #2. Becoming emotionally attached to an area or property type

It happens to many of us. You come across a property expert extolling the big profit potential of an area and we jump onto the bandwagon.

For example, if an expert recommends Moreton Bay and suggests looking at units or townhouses, you’d probably want to target them too.

So you go into the area having already developed a personal preference towards townhouse or units because you’ve been told of its potential.

 

But based on a research on the demographics of the area, it shows that a 2-bedroom unit will be a death sentence. The demographics aren’t keen on this type of property. They want relatively new, 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom, double lock up garage.

To ensure you avoid this mistake, look at what’s in demand in the area and understand your potential buyers and renters, not blindly following an expert’s recommendation.

Investment mistake #3. Relying on partial advice

It’s human nature. When it comes down to choosing between paying more for something better and getting a cheaper but lesser version, most of us will opt for the latter.

Although we know instinctively that you get what you pay for, we’re still attracted to the short-term “savings”.

This is especially true with property investment advice.

Unfortunately, trying to save money by relying on cheaper but incomplete advice could cost you more over the long term.

That’s because you end up filling the gaps with your personal preferences, emotions or skills and you’ll get it completely wrong.

If you have to rely on a report or recommendation, make sure that it gives you all the information you need to make an informed investment decision and leave you filling in the blanks.

Investment mistake #4. Following the herd/swarm

There might be safety in numbers, but when it comes to investing in property, more investors in an area doesn’t always spell profits.

Granted that there are benefits of banding together such as the ability to buy at a lower price, there’s equally a huge risk with this strategy.

Joining the herd creates a lot of competition in that market. A lot of investors in an area means higher competition for renters and for buyers when it’s time to sell.

"Dwelling approvals have fallen from their highs of recent years and been fairly steady over recent months however, in September 2017 the number of dwellings approved for construction increased on the back of a jump in unit approvals.  Data released earlier by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) highlighted the lift in dwelling approvals, which were recorded at 18,849 in September 2017, was 1.5% higher over the month and 0.2% higher than in September 2016.

 
According to the data, the 18,849 dwelling approvals were split between 9,989 houses and 8,860 units.  House approvals increased by 0.8% over the month and were 2.2% higher than a year ago.  The 9,989 approvals was the second highest monthly number of house approvals over the past 16 months.  The 8,860 unit approvals was 2.3% higher over the month but -2.0% lower than 12 months ago.  Unit approvals were the highest they’ve been since February 2017.  

 
Taking a look at the composition of unit approvals, the bounce over the month was driven by high-rise (four storeys or greater) approvals which increased by 36.0%, while townhouse approvals fell -4.0% and low-rise approvals were 8.3% higher.  High-rise approvals were at their highest level in 12 months in , and they accounted for 56.1% of all unit approvals over the month.  The trend of late has been toward fewer high-rise approvals and an increasing number of townhouse approvals so it will be interesting to see over the coming months whether the strength in high-rise approvals continues or it fades and the popularity of medium to low density approvals continues to increase.

 
Focussing specifically on the capital cities, there were 15,295 dwelling approvals in September 2017 which was the highest number of approvals in 12 months.  This figure was comprised of 7,015 house approvals and 8,280 unit approvals.  House approvals actually fell by -6.5% over the month while unit approvals increased by 14.3% to be at their highest level since December 2016.

 
Throughout the individual capital cities, house approvals increased over the month in Sydney (+3.5%) and Canberra (+10.5%) however, they fell in Melbourne (-10.5%), Brisbane (-5.7%), Adelaide (-6.8%), Perth (-8.7%), Hobart (-42.3%) and Darwin (-20.8%).  

 
Looking at the unit market, approvals were lower over the month in Melbourne (-4.3%), Brisbane (-53.1%), Darwin (-94.4%) and Canberra (-24.2%) while they increased in Sydney (+44.6%), Adelaide (+44.7%), Perth (+252.5%) and Hobart (+61.8%).  Sydney had its greatest number of monthly unit approvals since August 2016 while approvals were the lowest since February 2017 in Brisbane.  Unit approvals also surged in Adelaide, Perth and Hobart to their highest levels since May 2017, August 2015 and March 2015 respectively. 
 
The national population continues to increase at a rapid pace so it is encouraging to see a heightened level of new construction continue.  It’s pretty clear that units, high-rise units particularly, are driving the resurgence and Sydney has seen a large rise in unit approvals.  This will be an important trend to watch, especially considering that dwelling values are now falling in Sydney, investors are facing tighter credit conditions and the volume of stock for sale is at its highest level since 2012.  These conditions would suggest that developers may be a little more cautious bringing new housing stock to the market.  Of course, just because something is approved for construction does not necessarily mean that it will commence straight away.  While approvals may be rebounding the real test will be to see whether quarterly data on commencements also shows a rebound or if the data highlights an increasing number of approved dwellings aren’t commencing.

"When it comes to housing affordability, Australia consistently ranks as one of the least affordable countries in the world.

The latest data does nothing to dispel this stark reality, with the annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey stating that our five capital cities rank within the top 20 least affordable cities anywhere. 

According to the Demographia research, Australia also ranks in the top three of unaffordable national markets, with only Hong Kong and New Zealand being less affordable. 

The research was conducted using a system of median multiples to determine affordability, where the median house price is divided by median household income. 

Using this model, a ranking of 3.0 and under is regarded as affordable, while a ranking of over 5.1 is deemed severely unaffordable. Accordingly, Demographia ranks Australia’s affordability at 6.6, putting it in the category of severely unaffordable. This is compared with Hong Kong at 18.1 and New Zealand at 10.1. 

Individually, Australia’s main cities were also shown to be extremely expensive by global standards. Internationally, Demographia ranks Sydney as the second least affordable city for housing in the world with a median multiple of 12.1 (behind Hong Kong), with Melbourne’s median multiple of 9.5 qualifying it as the fifth least affordable. Meantime, Adelaide was ranked 16th, Brisbane 18th and Perth 20th.

More than simply highlighting Australia’s extreme affordability issues, the survey also points out the negative social ramifications of our extreme price trends. 

Significantly, it states that a lack of affordable housing has serious consequences for residents in the form of reduced discretionary incomes and lower standards of living. There’s no shortage of areas in which this is the case. 

Of the 54 Australian property markets identified by Demographia, 33 are rated as severely unaffordable while 14 are regarded as seriously unaffordable. Only four of the 54 markets are categorised as affordable. These are all located in mining towns, which the survey indicates could skew the results.

The actual rate of Australian property price increases is also referred to, with Demographia stating that Sydney’s median multiple has risen 60% since the first survey was conducted in 2004. It also adds that for the past two-years, Sydney has represented the poorest housing affordability ever recorded outside Hong Kong.

Of course, all this talk of unaffordability begs the obvious question: just which country does offer the world’s most affordable housing? The winner in this regard is the US, which enjoys a median multiple of 3.9. In comparison, Japan has an average multiple of 4.1, the United Kingdom 4.5, Canada 4.7 and Singapore 4.8.

The Demographia research was backed by findings within the CoreLogic Housing Affordability Report 2017, which identified how Australians feel about buying and selling property.

The CoreLogic report found the cost of buying a house currently takes 7.2 times the annual income of a typical household, up from 4.2 times the annual income 15-years-ago and that home ownership is becoming the privilege of high-income earners who are being forced to assign ever-increasing levels of expenditure to mortgage servicing.

"The combined capital cities returned a preliminary auction clearance rate of 69.4 per cent this week, marking the 21st consecutive week where the clearance rate has held below 70 per cent.  The trend towards softer auction market conditions has been led by the Sydney market where the final auction clearance rate has remained below 65% since the first week of October.  Auction volumes were similar week-on-week, with 2,471 properties taken to auction, compared to 2,525 last week. This time last year, 2,680 homes were taken to auction and a clearance rate of 78.1 per cent was recorded. Tasmania, the smallest auction market, recorded the highest preliminary clearance rate with 80.0 per cent of the 5 reported auctions recording a successful result, followed by Melbourne with a preliminary clearance rate of 73.3 per cent across 1,030 results.

Across Melbourne, preliminary results show that 73.3 per cent of the 1,030 reported auctions sold this week. There were 1,224 properties taken to auction across the city, up from 1,223 last week when the final clearance rate was recorded at 73.2 per cent. Over the same week last year, 1,377 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 80.6 per cent was recorded. The Inner region of Melbourne had the highest number of auctions this week (210), with a preliminary clearance rate of 70.6 per cent. However, the strongest rate of clearance was recorded across the North West region, where 82.4 per cent of the 108 reported auctions were successful. 7 of the 9 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 70.0 per cent.

Sydney was host to 806 auctions this week and a preliminary clearance rate of 68.8 per cent was recorded, rising from 63.3 per cent last week across 928 auctions. One year ago, 897 auctions were held across Sydney and 82.6 per cent were successful. Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, 5 of the 15 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 70.0 per cent with the stand outs being the Northern Beaches (83.1 per cent), Eastern Suburbs (78.4 per cent), City and Inner South (78.2 per cent) and North Sydney and Hornsby (74.4 per cent) regions. North Sydney and Hornsby was the busiest Sydney sub-region this week with 117 homes taken to auction.

The preliminary clearance rate in Brisbane this week rose to 51.5 per cent, from 46.1 per cent last week. Auction volumes were unchanged week-on-week with 171 homes taken to auction, while this time last year 191 auctions were held. Meanwhile, across the Gold Coast, 57.1 per cent of the 21 reported auctions were successful.

In Adelaide, a 66.1 per cent preliminary result was recorded this week across 147 auctions. Last week, 93 Adelaide auctions returned a clearance rate of 65.9 per cent for the city, while at the same time last year, 100 homes were taken to auction, with 71.3 per cent recording a successful result.

Perth’s clearance rate of 50.0 per cent across 20 auction results is down from last week, when 42 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 54.8 per cent was recorded.  Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a lower 44.8 per cent, and 34 auctions were held.

Across Canberra, 72 homes were taken to auction this week. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 68.3 per cent, down from 72.2 per cent the previous week. 

Tasmania was host to 8 auctions this week and so far 5 results have been reported, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 80.0 per cent.

CoreLogic is currently tracking 2,276 auctions across the combined capital cities this week, down from 2,525 last week. Over the same week last year, 2,680 auctions were held.

Melbourne accounts for just over 50 per cent of capital city auction activity this week with 1,145 homes scheduled for auction, compared to 1,223 last week and 1,377 last year. In Sydney, 750 homes are set to go under the hammer this week, down from 928 last week and 897 this time last year.

Across the remaining capital cities, Adelaide is set to see volumes increase week with 134 homes scheduled for auction, increasing from 93 last week and 100 last year. Brisbane is currently expecting around 140 auctions this week, down from 171 last week and 191 last year.

There are 65 auctions scheduled in Canberra this week, similar to last week (61), while in Tasmania, 9 auctions are currently scheduled. Perth volumes have dropped slightly this week, with 32 homes set to go under the hammer, down from 42 last week and similar to this time last year (34).

Melbourne is once again host to the busiest individual suburbs for auctions, with CoreLogic tracking 20 auctions in Reservoir so far this week, followed by Glen Waverley (16), Balwyn North and Craigieburn (15).

Summary of Last Week’s results

Last week’s final auction clearance rate increased to 67.1 per cent across the combined capital cities, after slipping to 64.4 per cent the previous week. Last week’s clearance rate was the strongest it has been since the week ending 27 August (68.3 per cent), although still well below this time last year, when 76.2 per cent of auctions were successful. There were 2,525 homes taken to auction last week, increasing from 2,318 over the previous week and 2,443 over the same week last year.

Across the two largest auction markets, Sydney and Melbourne, clearance rates improved week-on-week. Melbourne recorded a clearance rate of 73.2 per cent across 1,223 auctions last week, up from 70.3 per cent across 1,119 auctions the previous week, while in Sydney, 928 homes were taken to auction returning a clearance rate of 63.3 per cent, up from 61.3 per cent across 818 auctions the previous week.

Looking at the smaller auction markets, Adelaide (65.9 per cent), Canberra (72.2 per cent) and Perth (54.8 per cent) recorded a week-on-week rise in auction clearance rates, while in Brisbane and Tasmania, clearance rates fell when compared to the previous week.

Across the five regional markets that CoreLogic monitors, results were varied. Geelong recorded the highest clearance rate with 83.3 per cent of the 54 reported auctions recording a successful result, while the Sunshine Coast had the lowest clearance rate, with 35.5 per cent of the 31 reported auctions a success.

"Building activity data for the June 2017 quarter was published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics earlier this week.  The data contains additional insight to the housing construction sector, tracking quarterly dwelling commencements, completions and counts of dwellings under construction.  The data is showing a softening in commencements as approvals have slowed but still heightened levels of completions and dwellings under construction. 

Dwelling commencements

Over the June 2017 quarter, seasonally adjusted data showed that 28,087 new houses and 24,380 new units commenced construction nationally.  The number of houses commenced was 3.3% higher over the quarter but -7.1% lower than a year earlier while unit commencements were down -0.8% over the quarter and -6.6% lower over the year.  
 
Year-on-year new house commencements were lower in each state and territory, recorded at: -3.5% in NSW, -7.2% in Vic, -3.1% in Qld, -10.6% in SA, -12.2% in WA, -7.0% in Tas, -29.1% in NT and -37.9% in ACT.
 
Year-on-year new unit commencements were higher in NSW (3.3%), Vic (3.2%), SA (35.0%) and Tas (153.1%) and they were lower in Qld (-30.4%), WA (-40.5%), NT (-40.9%) and ACT (-17.7%).

Commencements for houses picked up over the quarter but are lower across all regions over the year.  Meanwhile unit commencements are trending lower in most states and territories with notable exception of NSW, Vic and Tas.  NSW and Vic have been home to the two strongest housing markets over recent years (Sydney and Melbourne) and are seeing the largest increases in population fuelling housing demand.  Meanwhile, dwelling values in Tasmania’s largest city (Hobart) are rising at the fastest rate of any capital city while stock levels are very low so it seems a supply response is occurring.

Dwelling completions

Seasonally adjusted data nationally shows that over the June quarter there were 28,251 houses and 25,090 units completed nationally.  Interestingly these figures are fairly closely aligned to commencements so what was completed was effectively replaced as having started construction.  Over the quarter, new house completions were down -1.2% and new unit completions were -10.2% lower.  Year-on-year new house completions were -9.0% lower and new unit completions were down -5.2%.
 
State and territory data which isn’t seasonally adjusted shows that year-on-year, new house completions rose in NSW (8.6%), Qld (18.3%) and ACT (73.3%) while completions were lower in Vic (-12.8%), SA (-3.7%), WA (-45.3%), Tas (-29.8%) and NT (-44.2%).
 
New unit completions increased over the year in Vic (11.1%), Qld (13.7%) and ACT (29.6%) and were lower in NSW (-20.4%), SA (-41.6%), WA (-22.3%), Tas (-40.0%) and NT (-69.9%)

Completions remain at high levels however, they have eased back a little.  Given that there remains a high volume of stock under construction (as we will analyse shortly) it’s anticipated that completions are likely to remain elevated for some time.

Dwellings under construction

At the end of the June 2017 quarter, there were 216,242 dwellings under construction nationally.  Although the number of dwellings under construction is down from its historic high of 224,314 in September 2016, it is still at an extremely elevated level.  As a comparison, the long-term average number of dwellings under construction at the end of a quarter is 106,774 and even over the past 10 years the average has been recorded at 153,545.  In June 2017, there were 62,409 new houses and 151,510 new units under construction nationally.  Again, both are well above the long-run averages of 48,329 and 38,964 respectively.

 
Looking at the data across the states, at the end of the quarter the number of new houses under construction was recorded at: 17,845 in NSW, 21,401 in Vic, 8,605 in Qld, 4,726 in SA, 7,669 in WA, 1,227 in Tas, 276 in NT and 660 in ACT.  By comparison, the long-term average number of houses under construction across the states is recorded at: 13,566 in NSW, 15,186 in Vic, 7,250 in Qld, 3,681 in SA, 7,455 in WA, 1,548 in Tas, 544 in NT and 938 in ACT.  All states and territories except for Tas, NT and ACT currently have more new houses under construction than the long-term average.
 
The number of new units under construction is where there is generally a substantial deviation from the long-term average.  Across the states, at the end of the June 2017 quarter the number of new units under construction was recorded at: 64,470 in NSW, 43,240 in Vic, 27,420 in Qld, 4,230 in SA, 6,360 in WA, 391 in Tas, 495 in NT and 4,904 in ACT.  Tas is the only state or territory with fewer new units currently under construction than its long-term average which is recorded at 431.  Across the remaining states, the long term average number of new units under construction is: 17,162 in NSW, 10,854 in Vic, 7,897 in Qld, 1,955 in SA, 3,382 in WA, 445 in NT and 1,235 in ACT.  The current number of new units under construction in NSW (+276%), Vic (+298%), Qld (+247%), SA (+116%) and ACT (+297%) is well in excess of double the long-term average.

The volume of new housing stock under construction remains at dizzying heights, albeit not quite as high as a few quarters ago.  The surge in stock under construction is being driven by units which by nature take longer to build and deliver more stock in a single project than houses. Interestingly, the number of units under construction has slowed in Vic and Qld but continues to climb in NSW.  This is probably to do with the fact that many property purchasers in NSW can simply no longer afford houses (particularly in Sydney) so units become their only housing purchase option. 

Conclusion

Although dwelling approvals have eased from their record high levels, over recent months they have been fairly steady.  They seem to have settled at a level which is well above long-term average levels.  While this means that commencements won’t be as strong going forward they are likely to remain high relative to historic levels.  There is a significant number of new dwellings (particularly units) under construction which means that completions are likely to remain elevated for some time. Once they do fall we would expect them to stabilise at a level well above the long-term average.  With the national population increasing rapidly, these people need to be housed so although housing construction is unlikely to remain as strong as it has been recently, we do expect that a substantial volume of housing construction is likely to continue to take place.

"The latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows that there has been a rebound in owner occupier first home buyer housing finance commitments.

In August 2017, there were 10,227 owner occupier first home buyer finance commitments.  The 10,227 commitments was the greatest number since December 2009 and it represented 17.2% of all owner occupier housing finance commitments, its highest proportion since July 2013.

A big driver of the surge in first home buyer housing finance commitments has been some recent policy changes for first home buyers in the two largest states (NSW and Vic).  From July 1 of this year first home buyers purchasing properties below $650,000 in NSW and below $600,000 in Vic do not have to pay stamp duty.  In NSW stamp duty concessions are available up to a purchase price of $800,000 for first home buyers and in Vic concessions are available up to a purchase price of $750,000.  Between June and August, the number of owner occupier first home buyer housing finance commitments has increased by 59% in NSW and 34% in Vic.  This data highlights that stamp duty is one of the key barriers for first home buyers wanting to participate in the housing market, at least in NSW and Vic.

Outside of NSW and Vic, first home buyers are generally larger proportions of the owner occupier segment, suggesting easier housing affordability outside of Sydney and Melbourne have held first home buyer demand comparatively high.

The following sections look at first home buyer activity across the states and territories.

NSW

There were 2,426 first home buyer commitments in August which was the greatest monthly number since January 2012.  First home buyers accounted for 12.9% of owner occupier commitments over the month which was the highest proportion since October 2012 and up from a recent low of 7.5% in February 2017.

Vic 

In August 2017, there were 3,162 first home buyer first home buyer commitments in Vic accounting for 18.3% of all owner occupier commitments.  The 3,162 commitments was the greatest number since December 2009 and the 18.3% was the highest proportion since August 2013.

Qld

The number of first home buyer finance commitments in August 2017 (2,190) was higher than the previous month but lower than the number in June.  The number of commitments in August was 17.9% higher than its long-term average.  Over the month, first home buyers accounted for 19.4% of all owner occupier finance commitments, down from 20.1% in July.

SA

The 490 first home buyer finance commitments in August 2017 was higher over the month but -17.7% lower than the state’s long-term average.  First home buyers accounted for 12.7% of all housing finance commitments in August and the proportion of first home buyers has not been above 13% since August 2014 despite South Australia being the state with the nation’s second most affordable housing market (behind Tasmania).

WA 

In August 2017 there were 1,589 first home buyer commitments which accounted for 26.2% of all owner occupier housing finance commitments.  The 1,589 first home buyer commitments was the greatest number since June 2015 and was 17.7% higher than the long-term average.  The 26.2% of all owner occupier commitments going to first home buyers was slightly lower over the month but was the highest proportion of first home buyers amongst the states and territories.

Tas

There were 129 first home buyer finance commitments in Tas in August 2017 which was -22.3% lower than the state’s long-term average.  First home buyers accounted for 12.3% of total owner occupier housing finance commitments for the state which was the lowest proportion of all states and territories.  Although the level of first home buyer activity is low, as a proportion it has increased over each of the past two months.

NT 

In August 2017 there were 60 first home buyer finance commitments which accounted for 20.5% of total owner occupier housing finance commitments over the month.  The 60 commitments over the month was -28.6% lower than the long-term average of 84 commitments a month.  With first home buyers accounting for 20.5% of all owner occupier commitments, their levels of participation is the second highest of all states and territories.

ACT

There were 231 first home buyer finance commitments in August which was 47.7% higher than the long-term average.  First home buyers in the ACT accounted for 19.3% of all owner occupier housing finance commitments which was slightly lower of the month.

The data points to an upswing in first home buyer activity in NSW and Vic which seems to be due to the removal of the impost of stamp duty when buying beneath certain price points.  First home buyer activity has also increased of late in WA and NT, two markets where values have been falling for some time which could be creating opportunities for first time buyers previously unable to enter the market.  Qld and the ACT have also seen upticks in first home buyer demand of late which is occurring due to moderately rising prices.  

Overall, first home buyer is expected to continue to increase, driven by NSW and Vic where buyers are taking advantage of the concessions to enter into the market.

"Upcoming auctions

This week, CoreLogic is tracking just over 2,300 auctions across the combined capital cities, which is similar to last week when 2,318 auctions were held, but lower than this time last year, when 2,443 homes were taken to auction.

Across the two largest auction markets, Sydney and Melbourne, volumes are similar this week when compared to last week. Melbourne is expecting 1,122 auctions to be held this week, compared to 1,119 last week, while Sydney is set to see 850 homes go up for auction, up from 818 last week. Over the same week last year, Melbourne held 1,182 auctions, while there were 913 auctions in Sydney.

Looking at the smaller auction markets, volumes will fall slightly in some cities. Adelaide has 84 auctions scheduled this week, down from 107 last week, while Canberra is set to hold 58 auctions, compared to 78 last week.

There are 151 auctions scheduled in Brisbane this week, similar to the 153 held last week across the city. Perth is expecting 37 auctions this week, compared to 35 last week, while Tasmania is likely to see fewer auctions with 4 homes currently scheduled for auction, down from 8 last week.

This week, Melbourne is host to the busiest individual suburbs for auctions, with CoreLogic tracking 18 auctions in Reservoir so far this week, followed by Epping (17) and Glen Waverley (16). Bentleigh East, Richmond and St Kilda each have 15 auctions scheduled this week.

Summary of Last Week’s results

The final clearance rate across the combined capital cities continues to soften, with last week recording a final clearance rate of 64.4 per cent, down from 66.3 per cent over the previous week, making it the lowest clearance rate since January 2016. There were 2,318 homes taken to auction last week, similar to this time last year (2,290), while over the previous week, just 969 auctions were held due to the public holiday long weekend in most states, along with the AFL and NRL Grand Finals.

Clearance rates across Melbourne and Sydney fell week-on-week, with Sydney recording a clearance rate of 61.3 per cent across 818 auctions, down from 64.9 per cent across 607 auctions the previous week, and lower than this time last year, when 79.8 per cent of the 816 auctions were successful. The last time Sydney has seen a clearance rate this low was late 2015/early 2016. Melbourne recorded a clearance rate of 70.3 per cent across 1,119 auctions last week, down from 87.0 per cent across just 122 auctions the previous week, and 78.4 per cent across 1,114 over the same week last year.

While clearance rates fell across the capital cities week-on-week, auctions volumes increased across all of the capital cities.

Looking at the non-capital city regions, the Hunter region was the most successful in terms of clearance rates with 76.9 per cent of the 33 auctions recording a successful result, closely followed by Geelong, where a clearance rate of 76.7 per cent was recorded across 54 auctions.

"Each quarter the Reserve Bank (RBA) publishes household finances data which look at the ratio of household debts and assets to disposable income.  The latest data shows households are becoming more indebted at the same time as the value of their assets are increasing.

According to the RBA, the ratio of household debt to disposable income was recorded at 193.7% at the end of June 2017.  The ratio sits at a record high having increased by 2.0% over the quarter and by 3.9% over the year.  Unsurprisingly, most of this debt is housing related; the ratio of housing debt to disposable income is recorded at 136.4% having increased by 1.4% over the quarter and 3.9% over the year.  

The first chart highlights how much household and housing debt has increased over time relative to disposable incomes.  It is also noticeable that since the financial crisis the rate of escalation has slowed.  Further data from the RBA reveals that of the 136.4% ratio of housing debt to disposable income, 103.2% is held by owner occupiers with the remaining 33.2% held by investors.

The second chart details the ratio of household and housing assets to disposable income.  At the end of June 2017 the ratio of household assets to disposable income was recorded at 935.6% and the ratio of housing assets to disposable income was 516.5%, both of which were record highs.  Over the past year household assets and housing assets have increased by 6.6% and 7.8% respectively, well in excess of the increase in household and housing debt. 

By comparing the ratios of assets and debt the RBA also produces ratios of household and housing debt to assets.  The data reiterates that although debt levels are high, at this stage that debt is well supported by assets which are valued substantially higher.  Over recent years the ratios of household and housing debt to assets has actually been falling.  In June 2017, the ratio of household debt to assets was recorded at 20.7% and the ratio of housing debt to assets sat at 26.4%.  

A big contributor to the declining ratio of debt to assets over recent years has been the ongoing fall in interest rates to their current lows.  The RBA publishes ratios of interest payments to disposable income for household and housing debt.  The fourth chart highlights that households are paying significantly less interest currently than they were when interest rates were much higher.  At the end of June 2017 the ratio of household interest repayments to disposable income was 8.7% and for housing it was 7.1%.  Lower interest rates also mean that where there is a debt, debtors have the ability (if they choose) to maintain previous repayments which in turn means additional debt is repaid as interest rates fall.  

The data highlights that Australian households are heavily indebted, largely due to housing.  While debt levels are high, the value of household and housing assets are, at this stage, considerably greater than the level of debt.  Of course, if household and housing asset values begin to fall in the future, the accompanying debt may not fall at the same rate and that remains the main concern with the ongoing increase in household and housing debt.  Although Australia survived the financial crisis with much less damage than most other countries, it is noticeable how there was a fairly sharp rise in the ratio of household and housing debts to assets over that period.  A more sustained downturn could potentially see a much greater increase in these ratios as asset values fall but the debt against these assets remain.

"Planning a wedding while saving for a home deposit is no mean feat, but it can be done. Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Propertymarketinsider.com.au explains.

So you want to get married and buy a home. Congratulations! Not many people dare to go through two of life’s biggest and most expensive milestones at the same time.

Are you crazy for even entertaining the idea? Perhaps. But don’t let the opinions of other people stop you from pursuing your dream. Some people have successfully navigated this perilous journey before. So it can be done.

But should you do it? Before you dive in, it pays to do a bit of soul-searching and reality check.

How to have a wedding and buy a home

Here are some ways to crack the property market and still have the wedding of your dreams.

Figure out where you stand together financially.

This should be your number one task. Yes, it’s not the most romantic to talk about money, but it’s important that you’re on the same page when it comes to finances.

Ask yourselves what’s your long-term goal beyond the wedding. Does this include buying a house, travelling or starting a family? What are your priorities?

Once you have a clear idea about your financial goals as a couple, you can set your priorities.

Prioritise your savings goals.

Yes, you can save both for a wedding and still buy a home, but you can avoid a lot of distress by deciding which to prioritise with your savings plan.

While some couples can do both at the same time, choosing one goal and delay the other for a period of time would make it more manageable over the long run.

The key is for both of you to agree on which to save for first and be happy with your choice.
Remember that you’re not giving up on your dream in favour of the other. You’re simply getting one done ahead of the other important milestone.

Set up a solid financial plan

Whether you’re choosing to save for your wedding first or a deposit, you need a plan on how to get there.

A good way to start is figuring out how much you need to save. Then look at your existing finances.

A wedding, just like a home can be as expensive as you want it to be. So a prudent way to avoid overspending is to set a limit on how much you’re willing to spend on your wedding. Then work your way back.

To give you an idea, Australians spent an average of $36,200 for a wedding according to a study by IBIS World.

So say you budget $30,000 for your wedding.
Using ASIC’s moneysmart calculator:

If you have existing savings of $5,000
You plan to save $1,000 per month
At 2% savings interest rate, you can reach your goal in 2 years 1 month or 25 months.

If you can manage to save more and for longer, you can significantly cut the time it takes you to save both for your wedding and for a home.

Ask your parents for help.

Parents and family can help you fast-track your savings either by paying some of the wedding expenses or by gifting you a deposit for a home.

Your parents could also offer to give you an interest-free loan to make up for the shortfall in your savings target.

If your parents or other relatives have offered financial help for either a wedding or a home purchase, make sure you’re clear about any conditions attached such as, are you expected to pay them back? By when and how much?

Set up a home purchase fund instead of traditional wedding gifts.

Ask your friends or relatives to contribute to your home purchase fund instead of a wedding gift. Most people would appreciate giving you what you want and need.
You can set this up as a joint account.

Watch your wedding spending.

According to the IBIS report, nearly half of couples (43%) end up blowing their wedding budgets.

It’s easy to get carried away. But remember that overspending on your wedding would have a dire consequences on your home buying fund. This is particularly true if you’re planning to buy shortly after the wedding.

If you’ve taken a personal loan to fund your wedding, you will find it more challenging to get a mortgage to buy a home due to your increased debt.

To keep your spending in check, make sure you create a solid wedding budget and stick to it, no matter how big is the temptation to overspend.

Reduce your wedding cost.

Don’t start your married life dead broke by overspending on your wedding. Here are some practical ways to cut your cost and still enjoy your big day.

Slash your guest list.

One of the best ways to save on wedding cost is to reduce the number of your guests. You don’t need 200 people to celebrate with you on your wedding day.
Be brutal in culling your list. Real friends will understand if you let them know why you’re keeping it smaller than planned.

Defer your honeymoon.

Postpone going on a honeymoon until you’ve bought your home. You have your life ahead of you. Waiting for a few months to buy your home is worth it in the end.

Ask your friends to shoot your wedding.

Wedding photography and videography are costly. While it’s tempting to get the best shooter to record your day, you can save a lot of money by enlisting some of your friends to donate their time or at least give you a discount.

Ask your friends or relatives to make the cake for you.

Wedding cakes are expensive. You could save a few hundreds of dollars by getting someone to donate a wedding cake for you.

These are just a few ideas on how to save for a wedding and your first home.
As always, the key is to start sooner and be consistent. Before you know it, saving becomes a habit.

"Welcome to this month’s Onthehouse.com.au housing market update

Please find below this month's Onthehouse.com.au housing market update, presented by CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless.

""This month we are providing an overview of how the housing market performed over the September quarter and reviewing some of the factors contributing to a slowdown in the rate of capital gains. 

CoreLogic’s national home value index edged 0.2% higher over the month of September, with dwelling values across the capital cities up 0.3% compared with a 0.1% rise across the broad regional areas of the country. The latest figures take national dwelling values 0.5% higher over the September quarter, which is the slowest quarter on quarter pace of capital gains since June 2016. ""

"There were 2,497 auctions held across the combined capital cities this week, up from 2,318 last week. So far, 2,007 results have been reported to CoreLogic, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 70.6 per cent, increasing from last week when the final clearance rate slipped to 64.4 per cent, the lowest clearance rate since January 2016. While we expect the clearance rate to revise over the next few days as the remaining results are collected, it will be interesting to see how the clearance rate holds up on Thursday when the final figures are released. Over the corresponding week last year, auction volumes were similar, with 2,443 properties taken to auction, while the clearance rate was stronger (76.2 per cent). The highest preliminary clearance rate was recorded in Melbourne this week (74.8 per cent), followed closely by Canberra (74.5 per cent). 

Melbourne was host to 1,208 auctions this week and so far, 1,042 results have been reported, returning a preliminary clearance rate of 74.8 per cent, while last week, 1,119 auctions were held and a final clearance rate of 70.3 per cent was recorded. At the same time last year, Melbourne’s clearance rate was 77.7 per cent across 1,182 auctions. Of the Melbourne sub-regions, 6 of the 9 regions recorded clearance rates above 75.0 per cent. Both the Inner South and the North West regions recorded a preliminary clearance rate of 78.8 per cent this week, followed by the Outer East region where 76.7 per cent of auctions cleared. The busiest sub-region for auctions this week was Melbourne’s Inner region where 237 auctions were held.

Sydney’s preliminary auction clearance rate was 69.5 per cent across 916 auctions this week, after last week saw the final clearance rate fall to the lowest level since late 2015/early 2016 (61.3 per cent across 818 auctions), although as usual this is likely to revise lower over the next few days as more results are collected. This time last year, auction volumes were similar with 913 homes taken to auction, although the clearance rate was much stronger (81.4 per cent). There were 6 Sydney sub-regions that recorded an individual clearance rate higher than the city as a whole this week. The Eastern suburbs (81.5 per cent), North Sydney and Hornsby (81.0 per cent) and Northern Beaches (80.7 per cent) had the highest clearance rates.

There were 170 Brisbane homes taken to auction this week, with 130 results reported so far. The preliminary clearance rate for the city is 50.0 per cent, up from 47.8 per cent last week and higher than one year ago, when 44.9 per cent of the 151 properties taken to auction were successful. Across the Gold Coast 34 results have been reported so far, with a success rate of 44.1 per cent.

This week, Adelaide saw a preliminary clearance rate of 68.4 per cent, with 79 reported results across a total of 93 scheduled auctions. In comparison, over the previous week Adelaide’s clearance rate was 61.4 per cent and 62.5 per cent one year ago.

Perth recorded a preliminary clearance rate of 57.9 per cent across 19 reported auctions, compared to last week, when 35 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 43.3 per cent was recorded. Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was 52.0 per cent, and 34 auctions were held.

In Canberra, 74.5 per cent of the 47 reported auction results for Canberra were sold this week, up from 59.5 per cent last week, but lower than last year (82.8 per cent).

There were 4 Tasmanian auctions reported to CoreLogic this week, with 2 sales.

"The RBA is likely to view the softening in housing market conditions as a welcome outcome and confirmation that macro-prudential measures have done the heavy lifting to cool the rapid pace of capital gains across the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets.
 

CoreLogic’s hedonic home value index reported the first month-on-month decline in Sydney dwelling values since March last year when the previous round of APRA regulatory changes were flowing through to credit policies and reducing investor participation.  
 
That previous slowdown in housing market growth reversed when the cash rate was cut in May and August last year and investment credit growth accelerated.  No such lifeline is likely to eventuate this time around, and in all likelihood, we will continue to see the trend rate of growth easing across the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets.  While the outlook for the domestic economy has improved, growth in wages and inflation remain subdued.  Additionally, a cooling housing market should ease some of the pressure on the Reserve Bank to push the cash rate higher.
 
Given that debt levels are at record highs relative to household incomes, household demand is likely to be sensitive towards higher interest rates.

"The combined capital cities saw significantly fewer auctions this week, with a total of 953 auctions held; the lower activity a result of most states being host to a long weekend as well as both the AFL and NRL grand finals taking place. Despite lower auction volumes, clearance rates held firm, returning a preliminary result of 69.4 per cent, rising from the 66.2 per cent last week when final results saw volumes reach their highest level since May this year (2,782).  Melbourne was the main driver of the strong clearance, with a preliminary result just under 90 per cent.  Over the same week last year, activity was equally subdued, with 872 auctions held and 75.8 per cent successful.  Brisbane was the only capital city to see a rise in volumes week-on-week.

Melbourne saw the most significant drop in volumes this week, with only 118 auctions held.  With such a low volume of auctions held, the preliminary auction clearance rate bounced higher to reach 89.4 per cent, rising on last week’s 70.6 per cent across a much higher 1,361 auctions. While one year ago, 114 auctions were held and an 87.2 per cent clearance rate were recorded. The busiest sub-region this week was Melbourne’s West, despite the grand finals slowdown the region recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 92.0 per cent across the highest volume of auctions (32).

In Sydney, 597 auctions were held this week, down from 1,033 over the previous week, however higher than the 530 auctions held over the corresponding week last year. The preliminary clearance rate of 69.1 per cent is up from the 65.9 per cent last week, and lower than the 82.5 per cent one year ago. Across the Sydney sub-regions, the Northern Beaches region recorded the highest rate of clearance with 87.0 per cent of the 64 auctions clearing, while the Northern Sydney and Hornsby region held the most auctions (79).

Brisbane’s preliminary auction clearance rate this week was 48.3 per cent, down slightly from 48.7 per cent the week prior.

"The Sydney housing market is starting to slow following more than five years of strong increases in dwelling values.  As the Sydney market slows there could be some upside for other housing markets where capital gains have been more sustainable and rental yields are higher.  Australia’s third largest city, Brisbane, has recently garnered more attention as a candidate for improved housing market conditions.   In this week’s blog we look at the historic relationship between housing market growth in Sydney and Brisbane in order to determine whether the slowdown in Sydney could translate into an acceleration in Brisbane.
 

The 30 year annual change chart above tends to indicate that after a surge in Sydney dwelling values Brisbane has followed suit thereafter.  Following Sydney dwelling value growth peaking at 61.7% p.a. in August 1988, Brisbane dwelling value growth peaked at an annual rate of 35.3% in February 1989.  Annual growth in Sydney dwelling values also peaked in January 2002 at 20.8% with Brisbane’s rate of growth not peaking until December 2003 at 30.7%.  Keep in mind that outside of these two clear examples, a rise in Sydney value growth has not necessarily been met with a rise in Brisbane (or vice versa).

 
What the growth of Sydney values in 1988 and 2001 did have in common is that they resulted in a significant gap opening between values in Sydney and Brisbane.  At its peak in August 1988, Sydney dwelling values were typically 104% more than Brisbane dwellings.  At its height in September 2001, Sydney dwelling values were 107% higher than Brisbane dwelling prices.  Recently the chart shows that the gap between values in Sydney and Brisbane has increased and at September 2017 the differential was 86%.  The long-term average premium for Sydney dwellings over Brisbane is 55% indicating that the gap remains above the long-term average.  Interestingly, even taking a shorter time-frame the average gap has been 56% over the past 20 years and a lower 41% over the past decade.

 
Queensland has historically been a popular migration destination for people choosing to leave New South Wales.  The above chart highlights that following the surge in value growth and the widening of dwelling prices between Sydney and Brisbane, migration from New South Wales to Queensland has typically increased.  Over the long-term, the average quarterly number of persons migrating from New South Wales to Queensland has been recorded at 12,376 persons.  Migration from New South Wales to Queensland peaked over the March 1989 quarter at 18,259 persons and then averaged 14,461 persons per quarter from March 1989 to December 1991.   Migration from New South Wales to Queensland peaked again in December 2002 at 18,129 persons and then averaged 15,392 persons per quarter from December 2002 to September 2004.  As migration from New South Wales to Queensland has recently picked-up, so far it has peaked at a much lower 13,487 persons over the December 2016 quarter which is only 9.0% above the long-term average.  By comparison the 1989 peak saw migration to Queensland peak at 47.5% above the long-run average and the 2002 peak saw migration peak at 46.5% above the long-run average.

 
Unless those people migrating from New South Wales to Queensland are retirees, employment opportunities must be a key consideration.  Post the 1987 boom in Sydney, New South Wales employment growth was slowing while it accelerated in Queensland.  Similarly in the early 2000’s employment growth had been greater in New South Wales than in Queensland however, by June 2001 Queensland’s employment was growing at a faster annual rate than New South Wales’ with Queensland employment growth consistently stronger than New South Wales all the way until January 2008.  Over this period, dwelling value growth in Brisbane had consistently been stronger than growth in Sydney.  Looking more recently, New South Wales has consistently recorded stronger annual employment growth than Queensland between September 2014 and March 2017.  Since April 2017, annual employment growth in Queensland has been greater than in New South Wales.

 
Although employment growth is important, the unemployment rate is also a consideration.  Although job creation picked up in Queensland after 1987, Queensland’s unemployment rate was consistently higher than New South Wales’ until October 1991 when it was fairly similar to that of New South Wales.  By August 1992 Queensland’s unemployment rate fell below New South Wales’ and remained lower until December 1994.  The New South Wales unemployment rate was then consistently lower than Queensland’s until July 2004 with Queensland’s unemployment rate remaining lower than News South Wales’ from July 2004 until late 2009 (thankyou mining boom!).  From February 2010 onwards, Queensland is yet to chalk up one month in which its unemployment rate is lower than New South Wales’.  Interestingly though, the gap between the New South Wales and Queensland unemployment rate is currently lower (1.1 basis points) than it was as the Sydney housing market was peaking in August 1988 (1.5 basis points) and January 2002 (1.9 basis points).

The trends presented here would generally suggest that Brisbane could be well positioned for a pick-up in value growth as the Sydney housing market slows.  Keep in mind though that there have been instances in the past where value growth has surged in Sydney and it hasn’t been followed by a surge in Brisbane, so a lift in Brisbane growth is no certainty.  A significant gap in the cost of housing between the two cities was evident in both 1989 and 2002 and it also evident currently.  As value growth rose in Brisbane, interstate migration from New South Wales hit levels significantly above the long-term average and although interstate migration is increasing it is yet to hit anything close to those previous highs.  Employment growth is accelerating in Queensland which may encourage an increasing number of people from New South Wales to Queensland and the differential in unemployment rate is smaller than it was in 1989 and 2002.

One other consideration is whether the same magnitude of people leaving New South Wales for Queensland will actually settle in Brisbane.  Both the Gold and Sunshine Coasts are much bigger cities in their own right than they were in 1989 and 2002 plus connectivity with Brisbane is much better than it was previously, so perhaps these migrants will be more inclined to settle on one of the Coasts rather than Brisbane.  Over the 12 months to September 2017, Brisbane dwelling values have increased by 2.9% while values on the Gold Coast are 5.4% higher over the year and Sunshine Coast values are 6.6%. 
In my opinion, before we can call a coming surge in Brisbane dwelling values we are going to need to see both more evidence that migrants are settling in Brisbane rather than the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.  Migration from New South Wales to Queensland is going to have to lift by a lot more than it has to-date.  Finally, Queensland will also need to see a sustained improvement in employment growth to lure more people across the border.

"If you’re seeking practical, easy-to-implement storage tips, then you’ve come to the right place! This checklist includes everything you need to pack and prepare your belongings for storage. Whether you’re storing your belongings for a week or a year, you needn’t feel overwhelmed by the process. We’ve got you covered. 

Make an inventory

Creating a comprehensive list of all your belongings will significantly help to reduce time and stress in the long run. On this list, note the items that need to be put into storage, and those that need to be disposed of. Creating a thorough inventory is an essential step in differentiating how much you need to store, allowing you to find the perfect storage solution for your needs.

Finding the perfect storage facility

During your initial research phase, you will come to notice one thing: not all furniture storage facilities are created equal. The type, volume and specifications of the items you are seeking to store will have an effect on the facility that will be right for you. When seeking the perfect place, attempt to answer these questions:

Is there adequate space to store all your belongings?
Are your specific needs catered for? Think about extra services you might need such as vehicle storage.
Is the facility security monitored 24/7?
Do you need a facility that is climate controlled?
Do you need access 24/7?
Finding the perfect type of storage

After conducting initial research, you must decide on the type of storage unit is most suitable to your needs. For example, containerized storage units will protect your items from the elements, as well as minimize the chance of handling and damages. As well as this, self-storage units and shared units are also viable options, 
each with their own pros and cons. 

Source and compare storage quotes

You should only be sourcing quotes form reputable and professional removal companies and storage providers. Keep an eye out for third-party storage industry association accreditation, as well as ISO certifications. Opting for a professional company will help reduce the risk of damage, dramas, and stresses down the line. 

Compare services

It’s important that you are shopping around, comparing similar companies and services within the industry. This will ensure you are getting the best bang for your buck, and also help you find the best service for your individualized circumstances. Also make sure to be asking the right questions – about storage conditions, and various leasing and access options. 

Ask about extras

Many companies will include a variety of services free of charge. Kent includes many incentives and free offers for customers seeking to store, for example, we provide professional moving blankets to protect your furniture.

Booking

If you have completed all these steps, and have happily selected a storage provider, you should make a booking. This should be based on the volume in which you require, and negotiated prior to moving. 

Work with a removalist

If a removalist has already been arranged, refer to your inventory and give them a detailed list of the items you are seeking to move into storage.

Sydney’s preliminary auction clearance rate was 71.5 per cent across 1,014 auctions this week, after last week saw the final clearance rate slip below 65 per cent for the first time this year (64.2 per cent across 916 auctions), although as usual this is likely to revise lower over the next few days as more results are collected. The current clearance rate across Sydney is significantly lower than this time last year when 80.4 per cent of the 946 auctions held were successful. There were 7 Sydney sub-regions that recorded an individual clearance rate higher than the city as a whole this week. Northern Beaches (84.7 per cent), Central Coast (84.6 per cent) and Ryde (84.6 per cent) had the highest clearance rates.

While the Sydney market continues to show signs of softening, with final auction clearance rates for the city falling to 64.2 per cent; the last time clearance rates were this low across the city was late 2015, however volumes reached their highest since June, with 916 auctions held last week, increasing from 826 the previous week.

Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra all saw an improvement in clearance rates last week, when compared to the previous week, while Perth’s final clearance rate fell.

Of the non-capital city regions, Geelong recorded the highest clearance rate, with 72.4 per cent of auctions successful, while the Sunshine Coast held the highest number of auctions last week (88).

"CoreLogic’s Accumulation Index looks at the total returns from the housing asset class factoring in the change in the value of the dwelling and the gross rental return from the property.

The CoreLogic Accumulation Index shows that nationally, the total returns from the housing asset class over the 12 months to August 2017 were 13.2%.  Because the return is calculated from value change as well as the gross rental yield, you tend to find that houses have a superior value growth performance while units offer superior rental returns.  Over the past year, total returns for houses nationally have been recorded at 13.5% compared to a 12.0% return for units.  Over the 10 years to August 2017, the annual total returns for housing nationally have been recorded at 8.8%, split between 8.9% for houses and 8.5% for units.

Total housing returns have generally been superior in capital cities to regional markets however, in the 2008 and 2010-11 downturns, returns slumped by a greater magnitude in the capital cities.  Over the past decade, combined capital city annual total returns have been recorded at 9.3% with returns of 9.5% for houses and 9.0% for units.  Over the 12 months to August 2017, total returns have been recorded at 14.0% for houses and 12.3% for units.  Like the national chart, the recent data for the combined capital cities shows that total returns have started to slow.

Regional markets are also beginning to see total returns slow however, the returns over recent years have generally not been as strong as those across the combined capital cities.  Over the past 12 months, total returns have been recorded at 11.7% for houses and 10.2% for units.  Over the past decade, annual total returns for housing outside of the capital cities have been recorded at 7.0%, 7.2% for houses and 5.6% for units.

Hobart has recorded the strongest annual growth of all capital cities over the past year and it also has some of the highest rental yields which has meant it has had the strongest total returns.  Total returns for houses over the past year have been above 10% in each of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra.  For units, double-digit total returns have been achieved over the past year in each of Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart.  Units in Darwin were the only capital city property type to achieve negative returns over the past year.

Annual total returns from the housing asset class,
individual capital cities, to Aug-17

With capital growth now appearing to have peaked and rental yields at record lows it is reasonable to expect a further moderating of total returns over the coming months.  The other important thing to consider when looking at total returns is the calculation of the rental income.  Although rents are increasing in many areas, the assumption in a gross rental yield calculation is that the property is occupied for 52 weeks of the year.  In some parts of the country this is increasingly difficult to achieve and it can eat into the investment returns.

The total returns data, particularly for the past decade, shows why housing investment has been so popular and hit record highs.  Returns have been fairly consistent and less volatile than equities however, the ongoing strength and the evidence of a recent slowdown should give investors pause for thought.  With mortgage rates starting to increase for investors, record-high levels of new housing supply and value growth slowing, housing investors shouldn’t assume that the types of returns seen over recent years will continue to be replicated going forward.

"Upcoming auctions

Auction activity across the combined capital cities is set to be quite subdued this week, with half the nation host to an upcoming public holiday; combined with both the NRL and AFL grand finals being held over the weekend, it looks to be a quiet week for the auction markets.

There are 805 auctions currently being tracked by CoreLogic, down from the 2,759 held last week and only slightly lower than final results recorded over the equivalent week last year (872).

The most notable decrease in activity will be in Melbourne, where only 86 auctions are scheduled this week, while Sydney is set to host the highest volume of auctions this week, with 515 homes scheduled to go under the hammer, albeit volumes are well down on last week.

Brisbane is expected to be the second busiest capital city this week, with volumes remaining relatively steady week-on-week, while the remaining capital cities are all expected to see a lower volume of auctions.

With such low activity in Victoria this week, it is no surprise that the busiest suburbs for auctions are in NSW and Qld, with Port Macquarie in NSW topping this list with 8 scheduled auctions, followed closely by Manly (NSW), Wahroonga (NSW), Paddington (Qld) and Surfers Paradise (Qld) all with 7 auctions each.

Summary of Last Week's Results

Results last week saw the final auction clearance rate across the combined capital cities dip even lower, with 66.2 per cent of auctions clearing, recording the lowest clearance rate since March 2016. However volumes reached their highest levels since May of this year, with a total of 2,782 held, increasing from the week prior when 2,510 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 66.7 per cent was recorded.  Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a higher 75.4 per cent, across a lower 2,480 auctions.

Melbourne’s final auction clearance rate fell to 70.6 per cent last week, while volumes increased over the week, with 1,361 held across the city, up from the 1,265 over the week prior when a higher clearance rate were recorded (71.4 per cent).  In Sydney, both clearance rate and volumes increased last week, with 65.9 per cent of the 1,033 auctions clearing,  rising from the 64.2 per cent across 916 auctions the previous week, which was the lowest recorded clearance rate for the city since early 2015.

Across the remaining capital cities, clearance rates fell in Adelaide, Canberra and Perth, while Brisbane’s final clearance rate rose.

Geelong recorded the highest clearance rate of the non-capital city regions, with 70.6 per cent of auctions clearing, however the Hunter region had the highest volume of auctions, with 63 held.

"There were 2,490 auctions held across the combined capital cities this week, up from 2,258 last week, making it the busiest week for auctions since the beginning of June. Based on preliminary results, the combined capital city clearance rate was recorded at 70.3 per cent this week, up from 66.9 per cent last week, although this will likely revise lower over the next few days as the remaining results are collected. Over the corresponding week last year, auction volumes were lower, with 2,149 properties taken to auction and a clearance rate of 76.2 per cent was recorded. Melbourne had the highest number of auctions this week, with 1,268 auctions held, and a higher preliminary clearance rate week-on-week (73.6 per cent), while the highest preliminary clearance rate was recorded in Adelaide (75.0 per cent across 72 reported auctions).

There were 1,268 auctions held in Melbourne this week with a preliminary clearance rate of 73.6 per cent. This week’s result shows a rise in the clearance rate for the city, after Melbourne’s final clearance rate was recorded at 71.8 per cent last week. Over the same week last year, Melbourne’s clearance rate was 77.8 per cent across 965 auctions. Of the Melbourne sub-regions, just 3 of the 9 regions recorded clearance rates above 75 per cent, with the highest clearance rate recorded across the North East, where preliminary results are showing 83.5 per cent of the 133 results were successful, followed by the Mornington Peninsula where 82.4 per cent of auctions cleared.

In Sydney, 897 auctions were held this week, up from 826 over the previous week. The preliminary clearance rate of 69.4 per cent is up from 65.8 per cent last week, however much lower than this time last year, when a clearance rate of 81.6 per cent was recorded across 815 auctions. The clearance rate for Sydney is yet to drop below 65.0 per cent this year so it will be interesting to see how the clearance rate holds up on Thursday when the final figures are released. Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, the Sutherland region recorded the strongest clearance rate of 81.3 per cent across 41 auctions, while the North Sydney and Hornsby region had the highest volume of auctions (160).

There were 132 Brisbane homes taken to auction this week, with 98 results reported so far. The preliminary clearance rate for the city is 49.0 per cent, up from 38.8 per cent last week and higher than one year ago, when 48.4 per cent of the 141 properties taken to auction were successful. Across the Gold Coast 27 results have been reported so far, with a success rate of 48.2 per cent.

This week, Adelaide saw a preliminary clearance rate of 75.0 per cent, with 72 reported results across a total of 98 scheduled auctions. In comparison, over the previous week Adelaide’s clearance rate was 66.2 per cent and 74.7 per cent one year ago.

There were 33 Perth auctions this week and so far 17 results have been reported, with 35.3 per cent selling. Last week there was a 41.7 per cent clearance rate for Perth.

Across Canberra a total of 62 auctions were held this week, compared to 72 last week and 87 at the same time last year. Canberra’s preliminary clearance rate of 73.1 per cent is higher than it was the previous week (70.1 per cent).

There were no Tasmanian auctions held this week.

Auction activity across the combined capital cities is expected to see a slight increase this week, with 2,270 properties scheduled to go to auction, rising from last week’s final results which saw 2,258 auctions take place across the capitals and also higher than volumes over the equivalent week last year (2,149). 

In Melbourne and Sydney, volumes are set to rise in Melbourne with 1,137 homes scheduled to go to auction this week, up slightly from last week’s 1,111, while in Sydney the number of auctions scheduled this week is unchanged from last’s week’s final result, which saw 826 auctions held across the city. 

Across the smaller auction markets, Adelaide is the only capital city to see a higher volume of auctions week-on-week, with Brisbane, Canberra, Perth and Tasmania all expected to see volumes fall. 

Reservoir in Victoria is the busiest suburb for auctions for another week, with 27 properties scheduled to go under the hammer this week, followed by Kew also in Victoria with 19 auctions, while Buderim in Queensland makes the top 3 busiest suburbs list this week, with 18 homes scheduled to go to auction.

Summary of Last Week's Results

The combined capital city final auction clearance rate recorded 66.9 per cent of auctions successful last week across a higher volume of auctions (2,258), increasing from the week prior when the final auction clearance rate fell to its lowest level since June 2016, recording a 66.4 per cent rate of clearance across a lower 2,074 auctions.  Last week’s results were significantly lower than the 75.4 per cent one year ago, across fewer auctions (2,062).

"Like them or loathe them, there’s no getting away from property market forecasters and prognosticators. But who should you trust? Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Property Market Insider explains.

For some investors, forecasts are crucial when making their investment decisions. They can be helpful in finding the next growth areas and for significantly reducing your research time.

Predictions also give you a sense of certainty which can be helpful in this uncertain world.

Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital and a frequently quoted forecaster explains that as investors, we look for any kind of surety or guarantee that we’re making the right decision when investing.

“People hate uncertainty and will try to reduce or remove it however they can. And if we don’t have the expertise, the experts must know,” he explains.

However, there are dangers to relying solely on forecasts when investing.

Forecasts of doom can make you exceedingly risk averse while expectations of a boom can do the opposite - it can lead to irrational exuberance. Both mindsets are catastrophic when investing no matter what the asset class.

But perhaps even more dangerous for investors is trusting reports that are produced by unreliable sources.

Property Market Insider asked leading forecaster Jeremy Sheppard, research director with Empower Wealth and creator of DSRdata.com.au. and Luke Metcalfe, founder of microburbs.com.au for their insights and insider tips on how to spot the real deal.

Whose property research or forecast should you trust?

First, let’s get something straight. No matter how famous the person making it, there’s no guarantee it will come true.

That’s just the harsh reality of the forecasting game.

However, there are people who make predictions on areas to purposely sell a development.

“Many suburb reports are merely developer advertising,” explains Sheppard. “Someone from sales and marketing or even just an office admin person will Google a few topics about a suburb. They pick out all the good things and ignore all the bad and package it together in something that looks professional.”

It's not easy to see through this kind of BS, it even fools some industry professionals sometimes.

So how do you assess a property forecast or research?

Here’s a checklist of what to look out for.

Is the report independent?

When it comes to assessing a report, there are only two factors that are relevant to investors: risk and return. Therefore, a quick way to tell if a report is independent is if it addresses those topics in an unbiased objective manner.

“You want to know if the report provider has a vested interest in conclusions you draw from the report,” says Sheppard.

“If there’s a property to be sold at the end of the report, it’s a developer marketing, NOT a research report .”

How experienced are the researchers or writers?

Any report delivered by temporary ad-hoc researchers are less reliable compared to those written by researchers immersed in the property market.

What’s the forecasters’ track record like?

Check the forecaster’s track record. Ask them if they've run the model for previous years and how accurate it was advises Metcalfe. “If they've been around for years, check their forecasts against reality.”

A proven track record would certainly help according to Sheppard. But he points out that track records can easily be manipulated to present a better result than reality.

“A common trick is to pick 10 hotspots and a year later mouth off about the one success and simply don't mention the nine fails,” explains Sheppard.

“I’ve recently compared half a dozen high profile property investment experts to see who can pick growth locations the best. I compared the performance of their picks against the national average growth rate as a benchmark for success. None of them had a greater than 50% success rate.”

How does the company or researcher make money?

Is it merely a marketing front for developers or are they genuinely independent researchers? Some researchers get commissions so it’s in their best interest to get more people to buy more in the area.

Does the research or forecast address supply and demand?

“If the research fails to address supply and demand or tries to include a 3rd or 4th topic in addition to supply and demand, then clearly they've missed the point since supply and demand are the ONLY factors affecting price change,” warns Sheppard.

Does the report come with hard and fast numbers?

A research without hard data is often just a subjective opinion which can easily be biased.

“Quite often a boring table of stats might be more help than paragraphs of emotionally charged monologue,” says Sheppard.

"The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released their biennial survey of household income and wealth earlier this week.  The release has a huge amount of valuable data but at least initially I thought it was pertinent to look at the dwelling tenure data.  The information is provided from 1994-95 up until the latest release (2015-16).

The tenure data is premised upon who is currently residing in the property, this is important to understand because when we look at the proportion of residents who own without a mortgage for example this doesn’t necessarily represent the total number of dwellings owned outright.  The reason being that some of those properties that are occupied by renters may be owned outright by the person who is renting that property out.

 
As at the 2015-16 release 30.4% of households were lived in by someone that owned that property outright.  This figure was lower than the 31.4% in 2013-14 and as the above chart shows it has been steadily trending lower over recent years.  In fact, at the peak throughout the timeframe shown, 42.8% of households had no mortgage in 1995-96.  This is an interesting statistic when you consider than many people suggest that lower mortgage rates result in improved housing affordability.  In June 1996 the standard variable mortgage rate was recorded at 9.75% compared to a mortgage rate of 5.4% in June 2016.  The ongoing decline in mortgage rates has pushed dwelling values higher and although it has made servicing mortgage debt easier it has not led to a greater proportion of the population living mortgage free.

 
With fewer households owning their home outright, there has been an increase in the proportion of households that live in a home that they own and still carry mortgage debt.  In 2015-16, 37.1% of households had mortgage debt which has increased from 35.8% in 2013-14.  At its low point over the period highlighted on the chart, 28.1% of households had mortgage debt in 1995-96.  Since 2003-04, there has consistently been a higher proportion of households with mortgage debt than those without.

 
As the rates of outright home ownership have fallen there has been a rise in the proportion of households which are rented.  Whereas outright home ownership has continued to fall and ownership with a mortgage has risen, it is interesting to note how the proportion of rental households has actually declined since the last survey.  The latest data shows that in 2015-16, 30.3% of households nationally were rented compared to 31.0% in 2013-14.  Back in 1994-95 only 25.7% of households were rented.  

 
As the prominence of renting has increased over time, the responsibility to provide rental accommodation has increasingly fallen on private citizens rather than the public sector.  At its peak in 1995-96, 6.0% of households were rental properties which were rented from state housing authorities, by 2015-16 this figure had fallen to just 3.5%.  This is an important consideration for governments when considering potential changes to investment policies such as negative gearing.  Governments are clearly not as involved in providing housing as they have been in the past, if private citizens or companies are going to be responsible for providing that housing it is likely they will require some incentives other than just the rental income, escpecially considering how low rental yields are across Australian cities.

The charts presented highlight how home ownership is continuing to decline which is leading to a greater proportion of the population either being in mortgage debt or renting.  As the population ages this can create challenges especially if an increasing number of Australians are retiring but still carry mortgage debt.  It also highlights that simply building more homes is not necessarily a solution to increasing home ownership rates.  As we’ve seen over recent years during a housing construction boom first home buyer levels have been at near record-lows and housing investment levels have hit all-time highs.  Arresting the decline in home ownership in Australia will be no easy feat however, the data indicates that simply building more housing won’t necessarily solve the problem particularly if it isn’t at a price point which is reachable for lower and middle income earners.  

We would expect that over the coming years, the rate of home ownership will continue to fall especially given we have seen dwelling values continue to climb since June 2016.

The combined capital city preliminary clearance rate increased to 70.2 per cent this week, after last week’s revised final clearance rate fell to 66.4 per cent, which was not only the lowest combined capital city clearance rate so far this year, down -0.1 per cent from the previous low seen over the week ending 25 June 2017 (66.5 per cent), but the lowest clearance rate since June 2016 across the combined capitals. It will be interesting to see what the final clearance rate looks like on Thursday once the remaining records have been captured. Auction volumes increased week-on-week with 2,225 properties taken to auction this week, up from 2,074 last week, and higher than this time last year (2,062).

Across Melbourne, preliminary results show that 73.2 per cent of the 938 reported auctions sold this week. There were 1,097 properties taken to auction across the city, up from 976 last week when the final clearance rate was recorded at 71.3 per cent.

The Inner region of Melbourne had the highest number of auctions this week (214), with a preliminary clearance rate of 71.7 per cent. However, the strongest rate of clearance was recorded across the North West region, where 86.6 per cent of the 82 reported auctions were successful. 7 of the 9 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 70.0 per cent.

Sydney was host to 810 auctions this week and a preliminary clearance rate of 72.3 per cent was recorded, rising from 65.5 per cent last week across 779 auctions, although this will fall over the week. One year ago, 758 auctions were held across Sydney and 80.6 per cent were successful. Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, 4 of the 15 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 75.0 per cent with the stand outs being the Northern Beaches (85.5 per cent), Ryde (81.2 per cent) and Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury (80.0 per cent) regions. The lowest clearance rate was recorded across the Sutherland region where 57.1 per cent of the 42 reported auctions were successful.

The preliminary clearance rate in Brisbane this week was 43.9 per cent, down from 45.6 per cent last week. Auction volumes were similar this week with 137 auctions held, compared to 138 last week. Meanwhile, across the Gold Coast, 29.4 per cent of the 34 reported auctions were successful.

In Adelaide, a 67.2 per cent preliminary result was recorded this week across 74 auctions. Last week, 76 Adelaide auctions returned a clearance rate of 50.0 per cent for the city, while at the same time last year, 88 homes were taken to auction, with 68.0 per cent recording a successful result.

Perth’s clearance rate of 36.8 per cent across 19 auction results is lower than last week, when 26 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 62.5 per cent was recorded. Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a lower 27.3 per cent, and 29 auctions were held.

Across Canberra, 72 homes were taken to auction this week. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 69.2 per cent, up from 66.1 per cent the previous week.

Tasmania was host to 4 auctions this week and so far 3 have been reported with just 1 successful sale.

"The quarterly property exposures data of authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) reveals a big fall in interest-only mortgage lending in the June 2017 quarter.  Although the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has mandated a 30% cap on interest only mortgage terms, this cap becomes effective from the September 2017 quarter.  The latest data indicates that although there is still some work to do, most of the heavy lifting was done over the June 2017 quarter.

 
In the June 2017 quarter there was $30.083 billion worth of interest-only mortgages approved, which was -7.0% lower than the value over the March 2017 quarter and -16.7% lower than the June 2016 quarter.  In fact, the $30.083 billion in interest-only mortgages was the lowest quarterly value since March 2016.

 

 

As a proportion of total lending over the June 2017 quarter, interest-only accounted for 30.5% of the value of all new mortgage lending.  The black line on the above chart represents the 30% cap which is currently being implements.  The 30.5% is the lowest proportion of lending for interest-only purposes since March 2009 when interest-only mortgage lending accounted for 27.4% of all new lending.  The proportion of new interest-only lending peaked at 45.6% of all new lending over the June 2015 quarter and has been trending lower since.  Of course, APRA recently (end of March 2017) advised ADIs that new interest-only lending needs to be comfortably below 30% going forward.  From our liaison with lenders we understand that by the end of the September 2017 quarter they are required to be below this threshold. While the June 2017 data shows a slowing from March, there is clearly still some work to be done to get below this threshold.
 
Comparing June 2017 to June 2016, the total value of outstanding interest-only mortgages increased by 4.3% which was a record low annual change.  As the chart shows, the growth in the portfolio of outstanding interest-only mortgages has been slowing for some time with the figure -0.4% lower over the quarter.  

 
Interest-only mortgages account for 38.2% of the total value of outstanding mortgages and this proportion is clearly much higher than the proportion for the flow of new lending.  Remember that the typical interest-only term on a mortgage is five years so the recent reduction in new interest-only lending will take some time to flow into the overall portfolio.  If we assume that interest-only mortgages are on a five year term, those written in June 2012 came to an end in the June 2017 quarter however, even though new lending has slowed the value of new interest-only mortgage lending was 27.2% higher than in June 2012.

Assuming that these caps remain in place for some time, the overall portfolio value of interest-only lending should start to fall significantly by 2020 given that new interest-only mortgage lending was peaking in early to mid-2015.

 
Interest-only lending is clearly an area of concern for regulators thus why a cap has been introduced.  The Reserve Bank reports that around 70% of interest-only mortgage lending is utilised by investors with the remaining 30% by owner occupiers.  The main concerns surrounding interest-only lending is that the principal is not reduced during the interest-only period which results in higher overall repayments for the mortgage once the interest-only period concludes.
From a borrower’s perspective, interest-only remains attractive, particularly by investors, due to the tax treatment of investment properties whereby the interest component of a mortgage is tax deductible but the principal is not.

Going forward lenders will have a lot of work to do to ensure that they remain below the 30% cap.  We’re quite sure that interest-only, where available, will remain a popular product however, the availability of this product is sure to be reduced while the cap remains in place.

"The RBA met industry expectations today, announcing its decision to hold the official interest rate at the record low of 1.5 per cent for September. The cash rate last moved in August 2016, shifting down to the current rate.

The ongoing evidence of slower housing market conditions were likely one of the key topics of conversation for the RBA when they held the cash rate at the historically low level of 1.5% in September.  CoreLogic home value figures released last Friday confirmed that the pace of capital gains has slowed in Sydney and Melbourne.  These are the two housing markets that have caused the most concern for policy makers because of the previously high rates of capital gain that had been running since early 2012, coupled with record high levels of household debt and high concentrations of investment.  

Surging dwelling values in Sydney and Melbourne had prompted some market commentators to call for a rate hike, however tighter credit policies have so far done much of the heavy lifting to cool the exuberance across Australia’s two largest housing markets.  With growth conditions across the housing sector moving back to a more sustainable level of growth, the likelihood of a cash rate hike in 2017 appears highly unlikely.  Record high household debt remains a key concern for policy makers. Furthermore, wages growth is continually subdued.  

With the household debt to income ratio tracking at 190%, households have become more sensitive than ever to the cost of debt and the RBA will likely be very mindful of the capacity for Australian households to service their debt without a broader dent on household consumption.  Mortgage rates are already pushing higher for investors and interest only borrowers, which is likely a key contributor to the slower housing market conditions in Sydney and Melbourne.  

Importantly, mortgage rates for owner occupiers are generally unchanged, and for some products have actually fallen over recent months.  The hold decision will be welcome in markets outside of Sydney and Melbourne where growth conditions have generally been mild to negative and the macro prudential conditions being imposed nationally due to the strength of these two cities is generally seen as a negative for other housing markets across the country.

"The CoreLogic Stratified Hedonic Index breaks the market into three segments: the most affordable 25% of properties, the middle 50% and the most expensive 25%. The data shows over the past year the most expensive quarter of the market has recorded the greatest value growth.

Over the 12 months to August 2017, the most affordable 25% of residential properties nationally have recorded value growth of 2.9% compared to growth of 8.0% across the middle 50% of suburbs and 11.4% growth across the 25% of most expensive suburbs. 

The national chart highlights that across all market segments the annual rate of value change has started to slow over recent months.  Importantly, the chart also highlights that when there have been housing market downturns it has typically been the most expensive properties that have been hardest hit while more affordable dwellings have been more resilient to downturns. 

Annual change in dwelling values across market segments, National

Over the period shown, August 1987 to August 2017, the thirty year period has seen values across the most affordable 25% of properties rise 1,517% compared to increases of 580% across the middle 50% of suburbs and 432% across the most expensive 25% of suburbs.  This highlights how affordability has deteriorated substantially at the more affordable end of the housing market.

The second chart shows the change in values across the three broad segments throughout the combined capital cities.  Over the 12 months to August 2017, the most affordable 25% of properties have recorded growth of 4.6% compared to 9.3% growth across the middle 50% of properties and a 12.2% change across the most expensive 25% of the market.  Like the national figures, in the event of a housing market downturn it has been the more expensive housing which has tended to see the greater value falls.

Combined Capital Cities

The third chart looks at the growth performance across regional housing markets where the change in values has been much more moderate over recent years than that across the capital cities.  The 25% of most affordable properties in regional Australia have recorded value increases of 2.5% compared to a 4.6% change across the middle 50% and an 8.4% increase in the most expensive 25% of properties.  Over recent years, growth in the affordable segment in regional Australia has been the strongest performed suggesting that demand has been for more affordable housing.  However, as the regional markets have picked-up over the past couple of years, it has been the top 25% of suburbs that have outperformed.  This is likely to indicate demand for luxury housing outside of the capital cities has risen.

Annual change in dwelling values across market segments,
Combined Regional Markets
 

The final chart shows the annual change in dwelling values across the three market segments throughout the capital cities.  Melbourne and Darwin are the only capital cities that have recorded the greatest change in values over the year across the most affordable suburbs and the slowest growth across the most expensive suburbs.  In all other capital cities, either the middle 50% of suburbs or the top 25% of suburbs have recorded the fastest rate of value growth over the year.  In Melbourne, this is possibly due to the fact that Sydney and Melbourne are the strongest economies in the country and are jockeying to attract talent.  Melbourne has a significant competitive advantage over Sydney in terms of being able to offer more affordable housing and the data seems to suggest that lower priced housing is a big driver which has led to a surge in values across the lower and also middle segments of the market. 

Annual change in dwelling values across market segments,
individual capital cities, to Aug-17

The stratified hedonic index offers another interesting look into the performance of the national housing market looking at how different segments are performing.  If the current housing market slowdown continues and turns into declines, watch for whether the most affordable sector of the market is relatively stronger performed than the more expensive segment.  With record high levels of household debt and significant first home buyer incentives over recent years the trends in a future downturn could be different to what has been seen in the past.

"The combined capital city preliminary clearance rate increased to 70.0 per cent this week, up from 68.3 per cent last week, while auction volumes fell week-on-week. There were 2,060 properties taken to auction this week, down from 2,270 last week, although higher than this time last year, when 1,899 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 77.1 per cent was recorded. The final clearance rate across the combined capital cities has been sitting in the mid-high 60 per cent range since June and it is likely that this will be the case again on Thursday when our final results are published. All but two of the capital cities saw the clearance rate increase week-on-week.

Across Melbourne, preliminary results show that 73.5 per cent of the 839 reported auctions sold this week. There were 976 properties taken to auction across the city, down from 1,124 last week when the final clearance rate was recorded at 72.3 per cent. Over the same week last year, 830 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 79.3 per cent was recorded. The Inner region of Melbourne had the highest number of auctions this week (184), with a preliminary clearance rate of 70.1 per cent. However, the strongest rate of clearance was recorded across the Outer East region, where 80.8 per cent of the 52 auctions were successful.

Sydney was host to 770 auctions this week and a preliminary clearance rate of 70.5 per cent was recorded, rising from 67.4 per cent last week across 832 auctions. One year ago, 747 auctions were held across Sydney and a much stronger clearance rate was recorded (80.7 per cent). Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, 7 of the 15 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 70 per cent with the stand outs being the Eastern Suburbs (81.3 per cent), City and Inner South (79.6 per cent), Inner South West (78.7 per cent) and North Sydney and Hornsby (75.3 per cent) regions.

The preliminary clearance rate in Brisbane this week increased to 47.1 per cent, from 43.9 per cent last week. Auction volumes were slightly lower this week with 136 auctions held, down from 140 last week. Meanwhile, across the Gold Coast, just 28.0 per cent of the 25 reported auctions were successful.

In Adelaide, a 60.4 per cent preliminary result was recorded this week across 75 auctions. Last week, 69 Adelaide auctions returned a clearance rate of 68.3 per cent for the city, while at the same time last year, 74 homes were taken to auction, with 79.1 per cent recording a successful result.

Perth’s clearance rate of 63.6 per cent across 11 auction results is up from last week, when 35 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 48.3 per cent was recorded.  Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a lower 46.7 per cent, and 27 auctions were held.

Across Canberra, 69 homes were taken to auction this week. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 68.4 per cent, down from 71.9 per cent the previous week.

Tasmania was host to 10 auctions this week and so far 8 have been reported with a 100 per cent success rate.

Published: 4 September 2017",2021_04_23,4-Sep-17,N/A,Auction Volumes Fall Across the Combined Capital Cities Leading into Spring
"Upcoming auctions

The first week of Spring is expected to bring a lower volume of auctions, with 1,899 properties scheduled to go to auction this week across the combined capital cities, falling from last week when final results saw volumes reach their highest level since June (2,270).

While historically auction activity has seen an uplift over Spring, it has been noted in previous years that the first week of September usually sees a lower volume of auctions compared to the week prior. Results from the corresponding week last year saw 1,899 auction’s held across the combined capital cities, which is the same number of auctions we are currently tracking for this week, although as the week progresses the number of auctions is likely to see some upward revision as results are collected.

The two largest markets of Melbourne and Sydney are both expected to see a decrease in auction activity this week, with 900 properties scheduled to go under the hammer in Melbourne, down -20 per cent from the 1,124 auctions held last week, while Sydney is set to see a fall of -13 per cent, with 725 auctions scheduled this week, down from the 832 held last week.

Across the smaller auctions markets, volumes are to fall across Brisbane, Canberra and Perth week-on-week, with Adelaide the only capital city to see a rise in volumes this week, while activity across Tasmania is expected to remain unchanged.

Reservoir in Victoria is the busiest suburb for auctions this week, with 17 homes scheduled to go to auction, followed very closely by Port Macquarie in NSW with 16 scheduled auctions, and Victoria’s Doncaster East and Balwyn North, with 15 and 14 auctions respectively.

Summary of Last Week's Results

Last week, saw auction volumes reach their highest level since late June with 2,270 auctions held across the combined capital cities, however the final auction clearance rate fell to 68.3 per cent, down from the week prior when a 69.8 per cent rate of clearance was recorded across a lower 2,064 auctions. Over the same period one year ago, volumes were a lower 2,153, while the clearance rate was substantially higher (74.5 per cent).

Melbourne’s final auction clearance rate fell last week, down to 72.3 per cent from 75.6 per cent the previous week, however volumes were considerably higher week-on-week, with 1,124 held, increasing from the 1,001 held over the week prior. In Sydney, a final auction clearance rate of 67.4 per cent was recorded across 832 auctions, down slightly from the 67.8 per cent over the previous week when 720 auctions were held across the city.

Across the remaining capital cities, clearance rates improved in Adelaide and Tasmania, while Brisbane, Perth and Canberra saw clearance rates fall last week.

The best performing non-capital city region last week, recording the highest clearance rate and the most auctions held, was Geelong with 86.8 per cent of the 48 auction reporting as successful.

"Auction activity increased across the combined capital cities this week, with 2,239 homes taken to auction; the largest number of auctions held since the first week of June. The larger volume of auctions returned a preliminary auction clearance rate of 71.1 per cent, up from last week’s final results when 2,064 auctions were held and 69.8 per cent cleared. Over the corresponding week last year, the clearance rate was 74.5 per cent and 2,153 auctions were held. It is expected as more results are collected that the final auction clearance rate will revise lower to remain within the high 60 per cent range, where clearance rates have been tracking since early June. Melbourne saw a higher volume of auctions this week (1,116), however the clearance rate for the city fell to 73.8 per cent, while Sydney’s preliminary clearance rate increased to 71.6 per cent across a higher volume of auctions week-on-week (814).

In Melbourne, Australia’s largest auction market, a preliminary auction clearance rate of 73.8 per cent was recorded across 1,116 auctions this week. Last week, Melbourne’s final clearance rate was recorded at 75.6 per cent across 1,001 auctions, while this time last year, 1,060 properties were taken to auction across Melbourne and a clearance rate of 77.4 per cent was recorded. Looking at Melbourne’s sub-regions, the Mornington Peninsula region was the best performer in terms of clearance rates, with an 85.7 per cent success rate across 46 auctions, followed by the Outer East region, where 83.3 per cent of the 85 auctions cleared.

Sydney’s preliminary auction clearance rate this week was 71.6 per cent across 644 auction results. There were a total of 814 auctions held across the city, increasing from last week’s final figures when 67.8 per cent of the 720 auctions cleared, and higher than one year ago, when 788 auctions were held across Sydney and a clearance rate of 78.5 per cent was recorded. Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, the City and Inner South region recorded the strongest clearance rate of 80.6 per cent across 81 auctions, while the North Sydney and Hornsby region had the highest volume of auctions (126).

The preliminary clearance rate in Brisbane this week was 45.4 per cent, up from 45.1 per cent over the previous week.

Adelaide recorded a preliminary clearance rate of 75.5 per cent across 68 auctions this week, up from 62.4 per cent across 98 auctions last week. Over the corresponding week last year, 83 homes were taken to auction, with 63.3 per cent recording a successful result.

In Perth, 33 auctions were held this week with 62.5 per cent successful, up on last week when the final auction clearance rate for Perth was 50.0 per cent across 35 auctions and higher than the 34.8 per cent across 29 auctions last year.

Canberra’s preliminary auction clearance rate of 71.2 per cent this week is lower than last week, when the final auction clearance rate was 74.6 per cent and lower than the 71.4 per cent recorded last year.

Tasmania saw 8 auctions take place this week, 6 results have been reported so far, with 5 sales.

"Over the 12 months to May 2017, only 4.8% of all houses nationally actually sold highlighting just how little stock sells in a given 12 month period.

Across house sales over the past 12 months, Tasmania saw the highest proportion of stock turning over with 5.6% of all houses in the state selling.  Conversely, Western Australia saw the lowest proportion of turnover with just 4.0% of all houses selling over the past year.

The low volume of housing stock which actually turns-over highlights why caution should be taken when looking at median sale prices.  Because of the low sample a median is based off they can be biased.  Furthermore, they may not be reflective of the whole market and when you compare between periods they may compare two very different bundles of housing types and quality.

The table provided highlights the five suburbs in each state which have seen the greatest turnover of houses over the past year.  Only those suburbs that have at least 500 houses have been included on the list.  

Suburbs in each state with highest % of housing turnover,
12 months to May 2017

Zuccoli in Darwin had the highest proportion of stock turning-over across the country with 38.5% of all houses in the suburb selling over the past year.  Note that Zuccoli is a relatively new, under-developed suburb of Darwin which is seeing substantial new housing injections.  Clyde North in Melbourne had the second-highest level of turnover with 17.6% of all houses in the suburb selling over the past year.

Even though the table details the suburbs with the greatest turnover of houses, each of the suburbs listed have seen substantially less than half of all houses selling.  
Another characteristic of the list is that most of the suburbs shown are areas where there is or has been over recent years, a substantial injection of new housing stock. This is also reflected in average hold period data which shows that in new housing estate areas housing stock tends to turnover with greater regularity. 

Overall, housing turnover in any given year reflects only a small proportion of the total housing stock.  It further highlights that taxes on transactions such as stamp duty are heavily reliant on collection from only a small pool of overall housing stock.

"The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) recently published population estimates by age and sex which provides a timely opportunity to look at the housing market performance of those council area’s nationally which are most popular with over 65’s.

Queenscliffe in Victoria was the council region that had the highest proportion of residents aged over 65 years of age at the end of June 2016.  Although Queenscliffe has relatively few residents overall (2,904), 40.3% of the council area’s residents were at least 65 years old. 

The accompanying list highlights the 50 council areas nationally with the highest proportion of residents aged at least 65 years of age.  What is immediately noticeable is that not one of these 50 council areas is located within a capital city.  In fact, if you list all councils nationally by their proportion of residents aged at least 65, the first capital city area listed is Holdfast Bay in Adelaide with 23.1% of its residents at least 65 years old. Council areas within New South Wales and South Australia also dominate the list with each of these states having 13 entries on the list.

House value growth performance of the most
popular retiree council areas nationally, July 2017

A further feature of the list is that these retiree-centric council areas tend to have significantly lower median house values than the individual state capital city housing markets.  This may be due to retirees moving to areas where housing is more affordable in order to free-up capital for them to enjoy their retirement, it could also be out of necessity due to the high cost of housing within most capital cities.  The locations are also likely to be linked to lifestyle preferences, with a large number of the top council areas located in regional coastal areas.

Looking at the value growth performance for houses across these top 50 regions, the data shows that generally the rate of growth has been lower than that of the larger capital cities.  31 of the 50 council areas listed have seen house values rise over the past year. 

The small council area of Quairading in Western Australia’s Wheat Belt region has seen the greatest growth over the year (+21.5%) followed by Shoalhaven in New South Wales (+15.3%).  Of those council areas that have recorded house value falls over the past year, the greatest falls have been recorded in Mount Remarkable in South Australia (-7.1%) and Flinders in Tasmania (-5.2%).

Published: 4 September 2017",2021_04_23,4-Sep-17,N/A,Top 50 Most Popular Retirement Regions
"Earlier this week the Sydney Morning Herald ran an article entitled Scott Morrison urges retirees to ‘free up larger homes for younger families.’ As I read the article, the logic seemed sound to me but the thought that kept popping into my head was what’s in it for the retirees to do this?

The comments from Scott Morrison came on the back of an analysis which found that New South Wales and Victoria were sitting on a glut of 100,000 underused houses.  Data from the 2016 Census showed that the population of Australia at the time of the Census was 23,401,892 persons and at the time there was at least 25,012,236 bedrooms.  Let me explain this analysis in some further detail; 39,769 households reported as having zero bedrooms, 87,397 household had six or more bedrooms and 198,351 households did not state the number of bedrooms.  If we assume the six bedroom or more households to just be six bedrooms we reach the 25,012,236 figure.  To further highlight the under-utilisation of homes, many couples will share a bedroom so two people in such a household only actually occupy one bedroom.  Similarly, many families have their children share a bedroom rather than occupy individual bedrooms.  The flipside is that some households use a spare bedroom as a study, media room, rumpus etc.  The point being, there are a lot more bedrooms than required.

According to the article, pensioners make up a large proportion of single people in large homes. So if we go back to the article’s headline, these pensioners should free up this housing supply for younger families.  When you look at the numbers it actually makes very little fiscal sense for a pensioner to do so.

From July next year, Australians considering downsizing will be given the flexibility to contribute up to $300,000 from the sale proceeds of their home into superannuation as a non-concessional contribution.  While this may be attractive, the family home is an asset which is currently exempt from the pension asset test however, the proceeds of any sale would count against the pension asset test.  So let’s have a look at a case study.

If we assume a theoretical house that has been held for say 25 years and we assume the subject property is in Randwick in Sydney as the article specifically mentions this suburb as having a large number of large homes with only one person living in them.  Twenty-five years ago, the median house price in Randwick was $307,250 compared to the current median price of $2,350,000.  Notwithstanding that larger houses are probably more expensive than the median, based on this data the median house price in Randwick has increased by 665% over the past 25 years or $2,042,750.  Over the 25 years the owners may have done some renovations however, the majority of the value increase has been due to the rising cost of land within a highly desirable inner-city area of Australia’s largest city.  

If the owner of this theoretical house was to sell and we can assume they sell for the current median price ($2,350,000) based on 2% agent commission it would cost them $47,000 to sell their home.  They would now have a lot of cash in the bank (cash which is receiving virtually no interest) and they could put $300,000 into superannuation but the proceeds of the rest of the sale would potentially count against any pension payments.  The owner now also has to find somewhere else to purchase, for arguments sake let’s say they bought a property for $1 million which is around the current Sydney median house price.  At a purchase price of $1 million the buyer would have to pay $40,767.60 in stamp duty.  So for this person to sell their home in this scenario they are going to incur $47,000 in agent commissions when they sell, $40,767.60 in stamp duty when they purchase and the leftover cash they have will be counted against a pension they may or may not receive.

Based on my understanding of the taxation and pension systems, when you run the figures, it simply won’t make a lot of sense for many retirees to sell the family home and downsize.  They will incur significant buying and selling costs and they may also impact on any pension they receive.  Furthermore, the capital gains they have seen on their principal place of residence can be used to fund their retirement.

Whilst in theory retirees in large homes in desirable locations should sell down these assets and free them up for others, the financial reality is such that it makes little financial sense for them to do so.  Retirees selling down assets to fund retirement should be a goal to ease the burden on the social security system however, the current system does little to facilitate that.  As a first step perhaps the Federal Government should look to include the principal place of residence in the pension asset test.  Although such a move is unlikely to be popular, it may provide the impetus for retirees to free-up underutilised housing.

Of course, I’m not a tax expert and I would welcome any feedback from individuals with a different perspective.

"The ongoing increases in dwelling values over recent years has led to a significant reduction in the proportion of sales occurring below $400,000.

In last week’s Property Pulse we looked at the proportion of dwellings selling for at least $1 million and showed how it has increased significantly over recent years.  This week we look at the other end of the spectrum how the lift in values has led to a significant drop in the proportion of dwellings selling below $400,000.

Across the nation, 31.2% of houses and 37.3% of units sold transacted for less than $400,000.  By comparison, a year ago the proportions were recorded at 32.8% for houses and 38.6% for units.  A decade ago, 62.4% of all house sales and 68.9% of unit sales were priced below $400,000.

Annual % of sales below $400,000, National

There are far fewer properties selling below $400,000 in capital cities than there are in regional areas of the country. 

16.8% of all house sales and 28.4% of all unit sales over the 12 months to June 2017 were below 400,000.  Even comparing these figures to just a year earlier the decline in the proportion of sales under $400,000 is extremely noticeable for houses (19.0%) and somewhat less so for units (29.6%).  A decade ago, more than half of all capital city house (53.1%) and unit (66.3%) were less than $400,000.

Outside of the capital cities, 52.0% of houses and 60.5% of units sold over the 12 months to June 2017 were priced below $400,000.  A year earlier the proportions were recorded at 54.3% for houses and 63.2% for units.  If we go back 10 years more than three quarters of regions house (75.6%) and unit (75.2%) sales were less than $400,000.

Over the past year, less than 3.5% of all house sales in Sydney and Canberra were below $400,000 compared to 35.5% and 40.0% respectively a decade ago.  In a market like Sydney, the unit market doesn’t even represent much of an alternative with 7.4% of all unit sales over the past year below $400,000 compared to 53.9% a decade ago.

Annual % of sales below $400,000
Individual capital cities

Looking specifically at houses, a decade ago only Sydney (35.5%) and Canberra (40.0%) had fewer than 50% of sales below $400,000.  Comparing that to the last 12 months, Hobart was the only capital city to have more than 50% (53.2%) of house sales below $400,000.

There has been a similar but not quite as dramatic decline in the proportion of units selling under $400,000.  A decade ago, only Sydney (53.9%) and Perth (60.4%) had fewer than 70% of units selling for less than $400,000.  Over the past 12 months, Only Adelaide (59.2%) and Hobart (78.3%) had greater than half of all unit sales below $400,000.

With dwelling values continuing to climb it is anticipated that over the next 12 months the proportion of properties selling for less than $400,000 will further reduce.  As in the way that the rising number of sales of properties for at least $1 million shows the deteriorating affordability, so too does the significant reduction in the availability of properties priced under $400,000.  As stated last week, the Federal Government attempted to address housing affordability in the Budget this year, it is clear that in order to improve housing affordability there is much more work to be done on both supply and demand drivers of the market.  A greater supply of stock which could potentially reduce prices would at the very least be a good start however, the supply needs to be supported by sufficient infrastructure and employment opportunities.

There were 2,041 capital city auctions this week, virtually unchanged from last week’s 2,040 auctions as well as being higher than the 1,795 auctions held one year ago. Volumes continue to track higher than what was seen over the corresponding July-August period last year. Across the two largest markets, Melbourne’s preliminary clearance rate rose this week (77.7 per cent), after last week’s final results saw a weakening in the rate of clearance, falling below 70 per cent for the first time since July 16 (69.8 per cent), while Sydney’s clearance rate also improved up to 70.8 per cent this week, however volumes were lower week-on-week in Sydney, while Melbourne held more auctions this week than last. 

Across Melbourne, this week’s preliminary clearance rate was recorded at 77.7 per cent, increasing from last week when the final clearance rate for the city fell below 70.0 per cent for the first time since July last year (69.8 per cent), and also higher than the 75.4 per cent one year ago. Melbourne was host to 997 auctions this week, higher than the 955 held last week, and higher than last year when there were 789 Melbourne auctions held over the week. Of the nine individual Melbourne sub-regions, this week the strongest performer, in terms of clearance rate was the North East. So far, CoreLogic has collected 108 results for the region and the preliminary result shows 88.0 per cent of these auctions were successful.  

Across Sydney, 704 properties were taken to auction this week with a preliminary clearance rate of 70.8 per cent across 558 reported results. Last week, the final clearance rate for the city was 67.6 per cent, across 798 auctions. Over the corresponding week last year, 687 Sydney homes were taken to auction and the clearance rate was 84.3 per cent. This week, the performance across Sydney’s individual sub regions was mixed. Across the South West region, where 42 results have been reported so far, the preliminary clearance rate was 61.9 per cent, while across North Sydney and Hornsby, 77.9 per cent of the 115 auctions cleared.

Brisbane’s preliminary auction clearance rate this week was 45.9 per cent, increasing from 43.8 per cent last week. There were 131 Brisbane auctions this week, compared to 103 last week. The Gold Coast was host to 52 auctions this week. Based on the results reported to CoreLogic so far, only 36.7 per cent have been sold. 

There were 34 Perth auctions this week and so far 17 results have been reported, with 47.1 per cent selling. Last week there was a 39.1 per cent clearance rate for Perth.

In Canberra, 68 auctions were held this week, and of the 61 reported results, 75.4 per cent were successful. Last week, only 56 auctions were held and the clearance rate was a higher 87.0 per cent. This time last year, results were lower with 49 auctions held and a clearance rate of 66.7 per cent.

Of the 7 Tasmanian auction results reported so far this week, 2 sales have been recorded.

"With dwelling values continuing to climb over the past year, the proportion of sales which have settled in excess of $1 million has also increased to new record highs.

The cost of housing has continued to rise across most parts of the country over the past 12 months, pushing the proportion of homes selling for at least one million dollars to new record highs.  Bracket creep should come as no surprise in markets like Sydney and Melbourne where dwelling values have increased by 77% and 61% respectively over the past five years.  While the rise in housing values has been most pronounced in Sydney and Melbourne, most other capital cities and regional areas have also seen a proportional lift in home sales over the million dollar mark.

Over the 12 months to June 2017, 15.4% of all house sales and 8.8% of all unit sales nationally were at a price of at least $1 million.  By comparison, 12 months earlier 14.4% of all house sales and 7.5% of all unit sales were at least $1 million in value.

The instances of dwellings selling for at least $1 million is much more prevalent across the combined capital cities.  Over the 12 months to June 2017, 23.2% of all houses and 10.8% of all units sold in capital cities were sold for at least $1 million.  The proportion of sales of at least $1 million has increased over the year from 21.5% of houses and 9.1% of units.

Regional housing markets generally have lower housing costs than capital cities however, the proportion of sales occurring for at least $1 million is also increasing in these areas.  Across the combined regional areas the proportion of houses selling for at least $1 million has increased from 3.5% in June 2016 to 4.1% in June 2017.  Meanwhile, the proportion of units selling for at least $1 million has increased to 3.5% of all sales in June 2017, up from 3.2% a year earlier.

Annual % of sales of at least $1 million,
Combined regional areas

Delving into the individual capital cities shows that Sydney and Melbourne have had substantially more properties sell for at least $1 million over the past year than the other capital cities. 

Over the past year, 47.8% of all houses and 21.3% of all units sold in Sydney transacted for at least $1 million.  By comparison, 10 years earlier just 13.8% of houses and 4.7% of units transacted from at least $1 million over the year.

In Melbourne, more than a quarter (25.9%) of house sales and 7.4% of unit sales were at least $1 million in value.  By comparison, ten years earlier 5.8% of house sales and 2.7% of unit sales over the year were at least $1 million. 

In all of the other capital cities the proportion of houses selling for at least $1 million is higher than it was a decade ago.  More than 10% of house sales over the past year in Perth and Canberra were at least $1 million in value. Perth is also the only city to have recorded a lower proportion of unit sales of at least $1 million over the 12 months to June 2017 compared to a decade earlier.

Annual % of sales of at least $1 million,
Individual capital cities

With dwelling values continuing to climb it is anticipated that in another 12 months an even higher proportion of sales will be sitting at or above $1 million.  While the flip-side of this is that the ongoing increase in the proportion of residential properties selling in excess of $1 million highlights the ongoing deterioration in the availability of housing affordability.  Although the Federal Government attempted to address housing affordability in the Budget this year, it is clear that in order to improve housing affordability there is much more work to be done on both supply and demand drivers of the market.

"Across the combined capital cities this week, the number of homes taken to auction rose to 2,011, compared with 1,857 over the previous week.  This was the largest number of auctions held since the last week of June 2017 and approximately one third higher compared with the same week a year ago.  The preliminary auction clearance rate of 70.5 per cent has increased relative to last week’s final clearance rate, up from 68.2 per cent.  However as more results are collected it is expected that the final auction clearance rate will revised lower to remain within the high 60 per cent range where it has tracked since the first week of June. Over the corresponding week last year, the clearance rate was 75.0 per cent and 1,471 auctions were held. In Sydney, the preliminary clearance rate rose to 72.0 per cent, which was higher than Melbourne’s preliminary clearance rate of 71.0 per cent.  Afar Melbourne has remained the stronger performer for many weeks it is possible that Melbourne’s final clearance rate could drop below the 70 per cent mark for the first time since July last year.

Across Melbourne, this week’s preliminary clearance rate was recorded at 71.0 per cent, down from last week’s final clearance rate of 73.9 per cent and lower the clearance rate for the city one year ago (78.9 per cent). This week, Melbourne was host to 948 auctions, higher than the 911 held last week, and substantially higher than a year ago when there were 605 Melbourne auctions held over the week. Of the 9 individual Melbourne sub-regions, this week the strongest performer, in terms of clearance rate was the North East. So far, CoreLogic has collected 112 results for the region and the preliminary result shows 78.6 per cent of these auctions were successful.  

Sydney’s preliminary clearance rate this week was 72.0 per cent across 625 auction results. There were a total of 782 auctions held across the city. Looking back at this weekend last year, 635 auctions were held across Sydney and a clearance rate of 78.3 per cent was recorded. The North Sydney and Hornsby region hosted the most auctions of any Sydney sub-region this week, with 138 properties taken to auction. The preliminary clearance rate for the region is 77.8 per cent across 108 results.

Brisbane was host to 100 auctions this week and so far 63 results have been reported, recording a preliminary clearance rate of 54.0 per cent. Last week, auction volumes across the city were higher with 156 auctions held across the city and a 48.7 per cent clearance rate recorded. The number of homes taken to auction this week increased across the Gold Coast with 49 properties up for sale this week. Of the 20 results reported, 30.0 per cent were successful.

This week, Adelaide saw a preliminary clearance rate of 72.9 per cent, with 59 reported results across a total of 87 scheduled auctions. In comparison, over the previous week Adelaide’s clearance rate was 63.0 per cent and 68.8 per cent one year ago.

In Perth, 32 auctions took place this week, with 10 results reported so far. Perth’s preliminary clearance rate of 40.0 per cent across these 10 results is lower both last week’s result (47.1 per cent) and the clearance rate from one year ago (52.0 per cent).

Across Canberra a total of 57 auctions were held this week, compared to 69 last week and 51 at the same time last year. Canberra’s preliminary clearance rate of 87.0 per cent is higher than it was the previous week (70.3 per cent).

Tasmania saw 5 auctions take place this week, 2 results have been reported so far, with 1 sales.

 Summary of Last Week's results

The final auction clearance rate fell last week across the combined capital cities, with 68.2 per cent of the 1,857 auctions successful, down from the week prior when a 68.7 per cent clearance rate was recorded across a slightly higher volume of auctions (1,987).  Since the beginning of June clearance rates have been below 70 per cent, however they have consistently remained within the high 60 per cent range, while auction volumes have been relatively consistent since the beginning of July. Looking at the same period last year, the clearance rate was a higher 72.5 per cent, while volumes were considerably lower (1,540).

Across Sydney, the final auction clearance rate increased last week to 66.4 per cent, after the week prior saw the final clearance rate drop to its lowest level this year (65.4 per cent). In Melbourne, the final clearance rate fell last week, recording a 73.9 per cent rate of clearance from 75.6 per cent the previous week, however clearance rates for the city continue to maintain strength relative to Sydney. Auction volumes were lower across both markets last week, with 911 auctions held in Melbourne, down from 956 the week prior, while Sydney hosted 620 auctions last week, decreasing from 714 over the previous week.

Across the smaller capital cities, Perth and Tasmania’s clearance rate improved last week, while Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra saw a fall in clearance rates.

Geelong recorded the highest clearance rate of all the non- capital city regions last week, with 73.3 per cent of the 32 auction clearing, while the Gold Coast recorded the highest volume of auctions last week (36), however the clearance rate for the region was the lowest (39.3 per cent).",2021_04_23,10-Aug-17,N/A,Auction Market Preview - 13 August 2017
"The consumer price index (CPI) for June 2017 was released earlier this week showed that over the quarter headline inflation was recorded at 0.2% which took inflation to just 1.9% over the year to June 2017.  Although annual headline CPI was temporarily within the Reserve Bank (RBA) target range of 2% to 3% over the March 2017, it has been below target for 10 of the past 11 quarters.

Adjusting dwelling value growth for inflation provides valuable insight into the housing market’s performance.  With inflation currently at such a low level, adjusting for it is not resulting in any additional capital cities seeing value decline however, over the longer term it does highlight the significant under performance in terms of value growth for certain cities.

While in nominal terms capital city dwelling values declined in 2008 and then again in 2011-12, in real terms the declines were larger over these two periods and values also declined in 2004-05.  In nominal terms, values fell by -6.1% between March and December of 2008 and by -6.4% between September 2010 and June 2012.  In real terms, values fell by -2.6% between March 2004 and December 2005, by -8.3% between March and December 2008 and by -10.8% between September 2010 and December 2012.

 

Since the value declines ceased at the end of 2008, only Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra have actually recorded real growth in dwelling values.  In all other cities, real dwelling values are currently lower than they were at the end of 2008 which is now almost nine years ago.  This data really highlights the uneven nature of growth across the capital city housing markets since the end of the financial crisis. It also shows that low mortgage rates alone are not the driver of the much stronger growth in Sydney and Melbourne.

The above chart shows the change in real dwelling values across each capital city relative to their most recent market peaks.  The chart again shows that values are only above their previous peak in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.  Brisbane values are -9.3% lower than their peak in March 2008, Adelaide values peaked in June 2010 and are still -6.3% lower.  In Perth, the market peak was September 2007 and values are still -20.0% off their peak and in Hobart values are -11.2% lower than their peak which occurred in December 2007.  Finally, Darwin has seen the largest fall in real dwelling values, down -26.7% from its peak with the peak having occurred in September 2010.

The regularly reported nominal value data is valuable however, it is important and interesting to consider the impact of inflation on dwelling values from time-to-time.  As the data shows, outside of Sydney and Melbourne and to a lesser degree Canberra, dwelling value growth has been extremely weak for a number of years now.

"Tempted to skip the frustratingly mundane process of getting educated before investing property? Read this first. Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Propertymarketinsider.com.au explains.

Some experts say that property education can be a curse when starting out as an investor. Because of the sheer amount of information, you could easily get lost and overwhelmed.

They argue that rather than make you confident, too much information could make you even more confused than when you started.

They say that getting thoroughly educated would divert you from your main goal and you could get bogged down with the unimportant details.

Getting educated can cause analysis paralysis that could cause you to miss out on the opportunities at hand according to these experts.

But before you're tempted to forgo learning about property investment, ask yourself this.

Can you really succeed without getting educated?

Perhaps. In isolated cases. But you’re simply exposing yourself to unnecessary risks. Why would you risk hundreds of thousands of dollars without understanding what you’re investing in?

Why would you take the expert's words as gospel and trust them without doing your own research?

Sadly, a lot of people still fall prey to these sly tactics. If you're not knowledgeable and aware, you too, would be convinced to trust their system, their technology and their so called experts to find you the best investment property.

These operators are counting on you to be overly trusting, complacent and lazy. They tap into your burning desire to get rich quickly without working hard.

We all know how these schemes turn out.

Knowledge is power. More than ever.

The rules of the property investing game have changed. The markets have moved and finance is harder to get. You need to be aware of all these factors before you invest.

But you also need to realise that you don’t need to become a property expert to succeed. At the very least, you need to know the basics of the asset class you’re investing in.

You need to understand the different strategies that you can use to make a profit and reduce your risk.You need to know how finance works and how to maximise it so you can build a portfolio you can retire on.

You have to learn how to manage your property, even if you’re using a property manager.

You need to know where to find the right information so you’re consuming unbiased reports, not the ones created by spruikers pretending to be independent.

Top tips for getting started quickly

Here are some tips on how to get started quickly and safely according to Jeremy Sheppard, creator of DSRData.com.au.

1. Learn everything you can

Buy a few books from a range of authors to get multiple opinions. Once you start hearing the same thing over and over, you know you’re ready. Be cautious of expensive courses with “high hope” marketing tactics. Whatever you can learn in a weekend course is not worth thousands of dollars.

2. Get your finances sorted

Budget so you live well within your means. Make sure your investment doesn’t stretch you too far. Remember that property investing is a long-term game. Don’t plan to tough it out for the first year, because that first year might stretch out to five.

3. Start with buy and hold

Capital growth is the ant’s pants of property investing. It’s also the easiest strategy if you know what to look for. Start off with this basic strategy. Once you can nail this you may never need any other strategy. But even if you stretch into other strategies, they’ll all benefit from having underlying growth.

4. Identify vested interests

The most noise in the property investment industry comes from people trying to sell you something. Not all of them are sinister.

You’ll find plenty of well-meaning individuals who are simply badly mistaken. You won’t know who to believe sometimes. But if you can recognise when someone has something to gain by the conclusions they can get you to draw, then that’s a good start to protecting yourself.

"Settled sales data indicates that although transactions are lower over the year across the combined capital cities the number of sales is beginning to stabilise.

Property transactions are an important component of the housing market, particularly for participants such as real estate agents and mortgage brokers that rely on turnover for their commission.  Furthermore, transactions are an important source of stamp duty revenue for state governments.

It is important to note the way in which property transactions are recorded.  All data is based on settled sales which means off-the-plan sales are counted once the property settles.  Upon settlement, which can be several years after the contract date, off-the-plan sales are recorded at their contract date which means recent years of sales will be subject to revision.

At a national level, the six month average trend shows that the number of dwelling sales is starting to trend slightly higher.  What is most noticeable is that settled sales peaked all the way back in July 2003, a time at which the population was around 4.7 million lower than it is currently.  While the national population has increased by almost 4.7 million persons between June 2003 and December 2016 there has clearly not been a commensurate lift in transactions.  This is likely due to a number of reasons including: the impost of stamp duty which discourages transactions, higher prices which lead to greater commission on sales and no real incentives for people to downsize homes when their children leave or they reach retirement.

Monthly settled dwelling sales and 6 month average, National

Across the individual capital cities the number of sales and the transaction trends are somewhat mixed.

Sydney 

Annual sales volumes are -0.9% lower year on year however, they have been trending higher from a recent low in April 2017.

Melbourne 

Transaction volumes are slightly higher than their recent low however, annual settled sales are -7.6% lower than they were over the 12 months to July 2016.

Brisbane 

Annual sales volumes are -9.7% lower over the past year and the number of transactions is clearly continuing to trend lower across the city.

Adelaide

Over the past year, the number of sales throughout the city was only -0.9% lower than over the previous year and the trend data indicates fairly stable transaction volumes.

Perth 

Settled sales are substantially lower than their peak and annual sales have fallen by a further -1.1% over the past year however, monthly data points to a recent stabilisation in transaction activity.

Hobart 

The city has seen a substantial lift in transactions over the past 12 months with annual sales 10.9% higher over the past year.

Darwin 

On an annual basis, sales volumes have increased by 10.7% and they have shifted higher off an historic low base.

Canberra 

Settled sales are slightly lower over the year, down -1.4% however, there has been a moderate lift in transactions recently.

The settled sales data highlights that although some regions are seeing transactions rise they remain well down on historic high levels.  The relatively lower volume of transactions across markets experiencing positive population growth highlights the ongoing inefficiencies in the housing market which discourage transactions.  These inefficiencies (detailed earlier) also have an economic impact as the high cost of exiting and entering the housing market is also likely to impact on labour mobility as well as home owners may choose not to move for employment because of these high costs.  These are some of the reasons why state governments may consider moving away from transactional taxes such as stamp duty and towards a broader based land tax on all properties.

"The first week of August saw fewer auctions held across the combined capital cities, with 1,846 held, down from the 1,987 auctions held the previous week, however higher than the 1,540 auctions one year ago. The preliminary auction clearance rose to 71.5 per cent, after the previous week saw the final auction clearance rate fall slightly to 68.7 per cent (revised lower from a preliminary clearance of 70.7%). Over the last month, auction volumes have remained relatively steady and while clearance rates have shown a softening, final results have been consistently in the high 60 per cent range since the first week of June. Across the two larger auction markets, Melbourne continues to show resilience to softening conditions relative to Sydney, with Melbourne’s clearance rate sitting in the mid-high 70 per cent range for another week (75.7 per cent), while Sydney’s preliminary auction clearance rate increased over the week (71.5 per cent). Last week Sydney recorded its lowest rate of clearance so far this year (65.4 per cent).

In Melbourne, Australia’s largest auction market, 75.7 per cent of the 799 reported auctions sold this week. There were 907 auctions held across the city this week, down from 956 last week when the final auction clearance rate was 75.6 per cent and higher than the 724 auctions held one year ago, with a lower clearance rate (74.2 per cent). The Inner region of Melbourne had the highest number of auctions this week (162), with a preliminary clearance rate of 75.4 per cent. Meanwhile, the strongest clearance rate was recorded across the North West region and Mornington Peninsula region, where an 87.0 per cent and 79.2 per cent rate of clearance were recorded respectively.

Across Sydney, 615 homes were taken to auction this week with a preliminary clearance rate of 71.1 per cent across 477 reported results. Last week, the final clearance rate for the city was 65.4 per cent, across 714 auctions. One year ago, 544 Sydney homes were taken to auction and the clearance rate was 77.5 per cent. This week, the performance across Sydney’s individual sub regions was varied. Across the Central Coast region, where 17 results have been reported so far, the preliminary clearance rate was 64.7 per cent, while across City and Inner South (84.9 per cent) and Inner West (82.1 per cent) the success rate of reported auctions was much higher.

There were 153 Brisbane homes taken to auction this week, with 84 results reported so far. The preliminary clearance rate for the city is 48.8 per cent, down from 49.6 per cent last week and lower than one year ago, when 54.5 per cent of the 127 properties taken to auction were successful. Across the Gold Coast, 20 results have been reported so far, with a success rate of 40.0 per cent (8 sales). /p>

The first week of August will see fewer scheduled auctions across the combined capital cities when compared to the week prior, with CoreLogic currently tracking 1,707 auctions this week, decreasing from last week’s final results which saw 1,987 capital city auctions held, however, the number of auctions will be higher than the 1,540 auctions held over the corresponding week last year.

In Melbourne and Sydney, auction activity is expected to decrease across the two major markets, with 846 Melbourne homes scheduled to go to auction, down from last week’s 956, and 562 auctions scheduled across Sydney, decreasing from the 714 auctions held last week.

Across the remaining capital cities, the number of scheduled auctions will be lower in Adelaide and Brisbane, while Canberra, Perth and Tasmania will see an increase in volumes week-on-week.

For the 5th week in a row, all of the busiest suburbs for auctions were in Victoria, with 17 homes scheduled to go to auction in Craigieburn this week, followed by Reservoir (16), Bentleigh East (15) and Kew and Mill Park with 13 auctions each.

Summary of Last Week’s results

Last week, the final auction clearance rate fell across the combined capital cities, with 68.7 per cent of the 1,987 auctions reporting as successful, down from the previous week when a clearance rate of 69.9 per cent was recorded across a lower volume of auctions (1,748). Looking at results from one year ago, the clearance rate for the combined capitals was a higher 72.0 per cent, across 1,610 auctions.

Across Melbourne, the final auction clearance rate increased to 75.6 per cent last week, across a higher volume of auctions week-on-week (956), over the week prior volumes were a lower 833 with 73.8 per cent clearing. In Sydney, the final clearance rate for the city fell last week, recording the lowest clearance rate year-to-date (65.4 per cent), down from the previous week when the clearance rate increased to over 70 per cent after remaining in the high 60 per cent range for 6 consecutive weeks. However, auction volumes were higher last week across the city, with 714 auctions held increasing from the 625 over the week prior.

Across the smaller auction markets, clearance rates decreased last week across the remaining capital cities, with the exception of Brisbane which saw an increase over the week.

The Gold Coast was the busiest non-capital city region last week, with 80 auctions; however Geelong recorded the strongest clearance rate at 82.1 per cent.

"CoreLogic recently released the June 2017 Mapping the Market Report.  The report looks at how the cost of housing has shifted across Australia’s capital cities by suburbs over the past five years by comparing thematic maps which show suburb median values.  Over the five years to June 2017, there has been a significant decline in the number of suburbs with a median value below $400,000 while there has been a significant increase in suburbs with values above $1 million.  The decline in lower value housing and rise in more expensive housing is most prevalent in Sydney and Melbourne however, it is also prevalent to a more moderate degree in other capital cities.

The following maps show the suburb median house values across the capital cities in June 2012 and June 2017.  The circles on the map represent distances of 10 kilometres, 20 kilometres and 50 kilometres from the capital city GPO.  For this blog we are only focusing on the housing market however, the full report does also include similar maps for units.

 

Sydney houses


In June 2012, 21.3% of Sydney suburbs had a median house value of more than $1 million, by June 2017 55.7% of suburbs had a median house value in excess of $1 million while only 8.7% of suburbs had a median value below $600,000 and most were located more than 50 kilometres from the CBD.

Melbourne houses


In June 2012, 9.5% of Melbourne suburbs had a median house value in excess of $1 million and by June 2017 that figure had increased to 32.6% of suburbs.  On the flip-side, 24.3% of Melbourne suburbs in June 2012 had a median house value below $400,000 compared to just 2.7% by June 2017.

Brisbane houses


In June 2017 only 5.9% of Brisbane suburbs had a median house value of more than $1 million compared to 1.6% in June 2012.  In June 2017, 23.2% of suburbs had a median house value of less than $400,000 compared to 34.5% in 2012.

Adelaide houses


In Adelaide, 43.0% of suburbs had a median house value of less than $400,000 in June 2012 compared to 25.8% in 2017.  37.2% of Adelaide suburbs had a median house value of more than $600,000 in June 2017 compared to 20.6% five years earlier.

 

Perth houses


7.8% of Perth suburbs had a median house value of more than $1 million in June 2012 compared to 11.1% by June 2017.  Only 17.7% of Perth suburbs had a median house value of less than $400,000 in June 2017 and this figure was down from 29.0% five years earlier.

Hobart houses


In June 2012, the majority (67.4%) of Hobart suburbs had a median house value of less than $400,000 however, by June 2017 43.6% of suburbs had a median below $400,000.  Although the number of suburbs with typical values below $400,000 has reduced over the past five years, 89.4% of the cities suburbs have a median house value below $600,000 and no suburb has a median value in excess of $1 million.

Darwin houses



Darwin has suffered through a lack of more affordable housing for a number of years now with only 1.8% of suburbs having a median house value below $400,000 in June 2017, down from 1.9% five years earlier.  54.5% of Darwin’s suburbs had a median house value of more than $600,000 in June 2017 compared to 50.9% five years ago.  The data highlights that Darwin housing affordability is relatively unchanged over the past five years.

Canberra houses


In June 2012, just 1.1% of suburbs in Canberra had a median house value of less than $400,000, by June 2017 no suburbs sat below the $400,000 threshold.  The proportion of suburbs with a median value of more than $1 million has shifted from 8.6% in June 2012 to 12.0% in June 2017.

The charts and commentary highlight how the supply of affordable housing has reduced over the past five years.  The decline in lower priced housing stock is most stark in Sydney and to a lesser but still significant degree in Melbourne.  The fall in mortgage rates over the past five years has made servicing mortgage debt easier and eat up a lower proportion of household income.  At the same time there has been little growth in household income but dwelling value in Sydney and Melbourne in particularly have increased significantly.  For those that own a home and have seen values rise it has created a significant wealth boost while for potential buyers, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, wages haven’t kept up with value growth which has led to a deterioration in the supply of lower priced housing.  All of these factors have led to extreme difficulty in saving a large enough deposit to enter into the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets for those that don’t already own.  While the problems are not so prevalent elsewhere, across all cities the supply of lower priced housing has reduced over the five years to June 2017 highlighting greater difficulty for lower income households to own residential property.

"The 2016 Census showed that 30.9% of residential properties nationally were rented.  The proportion of properties rented has been trending higher, increasing from 29.6% at the time of the 2011 Census and 27.2% at the time of the 2006 Census.  While the proportion of dwellings being rented is climbing, the proportion of properties owned without a mortgage has also been trending lower and the rate of home ownership has diminished.

Importantly, properties classified as rentals aren’t just owned by private investors.  The Census data shows almost 12% of rented dwellings are owned by state or territory housing authorities and 2% are owned by community/church groups.  The vast majority of rental are owned by investors, with 60% being rented through a real estate agent, while a surprisingly high 20% of rented dwellings are rented by individuals not in the same household.

The list provided in this report shows the SA2 regions of the country that had the highest proportion of properties rented at the time of the 2016 Census.  As an aside, an SA2 region, on average, is home to 10,000 residents and, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the purpose of the SA2 region is to represent a community that interacts together socially and economically.

Top 50 SA2 regions of Australia with the highest proportion
of properties rented, 2016 Census

The table also shows the proportion of properties rented over the 2006, 2011 and 2016 Census.  Note that only regions with at least 1,000 total properties at the time of the 2016 Census have been included on the list.

Across the top 50 list, only nine of the 50 regions listed had a lower proportion of properties rented in 2016 compared to the proportion at the time of the 2006 Census.  Interestingly, three of these regions were the top three most rental-centric regions (Torres Straight Islands, East Arnhem and Nhulunbuy).  Note that the rental accommodation in these three regions is predominately provided by government.

Looking at the list of these most rental-centric regions, they can generally be characterised as being: mining and resource related regions, inner-city locations or areas which have undergone significant increases in housing density over recent years.

Over the past 10 years some of these regions have seen a significant increase in the proportion of properties being rented.  In Pimpama which is half way between Brisbane and the Gold Coast the proportion of properties rented has increased from 29.9% in 2006 to 62.7% in 2016.  South Hedland, in Western Australia’s Pilbara region, has also seen a significant increase in the instances of renting from 36.0% in 2006 to 65.6% in 2016.

By the time of the next Census is 2021 it is anticipated that the proportion of properties that are rented will have increased further given a growing population and ongoing housing affordability pressures, particularly within the largest housing markets (Sydney and Melbourne).

"The combined capital city preliminary clearance rate was recorded at 70.7 per cent this week, up slightly from last week, when the final clearance rate was recorded at 69.9 per cent. Auction clearance rates have seen a slight improvement across the combined capital cities over the month of July, with the final clearance rate over the last two weeks just falling short of the 70 per cent mark. Auction volumes were higher this week with 1,957 homes taken to auction across the combined capital cities, up from 1,748 last week, and higher than this time last year when 1,610 auctions were held. Perth and Tasmania were the only cities where auction volumes fell over the week.  There were 943 auctions held in Melbourne this week with a preliminary clearance rate of 77.2 per cent, increasing from a final clearance rate of 73.8 per cent last week across 833 auctions. Over the same week last year, Melbourne’s clearance rate was 75.3 per cent across 754 auctions. Of the 9 Melbourne sub-regions, 5 recorded clearance rates above 80.0 per cent, with the highest clearance recorded across the Mornington Peninsula, with preliminary results showing 87.2 per cent of the 39 results were successful, followed by the North West where 81.3 per cent of auctions cleared.  In Sydney, 704 properties were taken to auction this week with a preliminary clearance rate of 68.0 per cent. Last week, the final clearance rate for the city was 70.3 per cent across 625 auctions, after sitting below the 70 per cent mark for the previous 6 weeks, so it will be interesting to see what the final clearance rate is like on Thursday. One year ago, 509 Sydney homes were taken to auction and the clearance rate was 78.0 per cent. This week, the performance across Sydney’s individual sub regions was mixed. Across the South West region, where 47 of the 50 results have been reported so far, the preliminary clearance rate was 40.4 per cent, while across the Eastern suburbs (90.0 per cent) and Inner West (81.8 per cent) regions, the success rate of reported auctions was much higher.  There were 158 Brisbane homes taken to auction this week, with 116 results reported so far. The preliminary clearance rate for the city is 53.4 per cent, up from 46.4 per cent last week and higher than one year ago, when 48.5 per cent of the 156 properties taken to auction were successful. Across the Gold Coast 34 results have been reported so far, with a success rate of 38.2 per cent.  This week, Adelaide saw a preliminary clearance rate of 64.3 per cent, with 56 reported results across a total of 80 scheduled auctions. In comparison, over the previous week Adelaide’s clearance rate was 66.7 per cent and 68.8 per cent one year ago.  There were 25 Perth auctions this week and so far 15 results have been reported, with 26.7 per cent selling. Last week there was a 57.7 per cent clearance rate for Perth. Canberra’s preliminary auction clearance rate of 74.4 per cent across 47 auctions is higher than both last week, when the final auction clearance rate was 71.8 per cent, and last year (74.3 per cent). There were no auctions held in Tasmania this week. In comparison, there were 4 auctions last week, with all 4 recording a successful result.

Auction volumes are set to remain steady for another week, with 1,787 properties scheduled to go to auction this week across the combined capital cities. Over the last 3 weeks, auction activity has remained relatively sedate, with this week expected to increase by only 2 per cent when compared to last week’s final results (1,748).

Looking at the two major auction markets of Melbourne and Sydney, volumes are set to increase over the week, with 862 homes scheduled to go under the hammer in Melbourne, and 647 auctions scheduled across Sydney, increasing on last week’s 833 and 625 auctions held respectively.

Across the smaller auction markets, Adelaide and Brisbane will see an increase in auction activity over the week, while Canberra, Perth and Tasmania will see a lower volume of auctions scheduled this week compared to last week.

The total number of homes scheduled to go to auction this week is higher than what was seen over the same week last year (1,610).

Werribee in Victoria is the busiest suburb for auctions across the nation this week, with 18 properties scheduled to go to auction, followed closely by Reservoir (14), Frankston (13) and Elwood (12), all of the busiest suburbs this week are in Victoria.

"Consider the market

Your first instinct, understandably, will probably be to make an offer that’s lower than the asking price. However, your chances of success will hinge exclusively on the status of the market you’re trying to buy into. In a high-demand, low-supply capital city market, trying to negotiate a lower price based on any type of shortcomings or deficiencies simply won’t work. Not only have any prevailing issues already been factored in to the expected price range, there are simply too many buyers eager to obtain a property regardless of any problems.

“In a hot market, you’re going to be competing against people who have seen that any issues have been factored into the price, so if you’re hoping to get a price reduction, you’re going to be disappointed time and time again,” says Real Estate Institute of NSW President John Cunningham.

When the worm turns

Conversely, if the market you find yourself in is characterised by high supply and low demand, then it’s an entirely different story. While any existing issues or problems may still be factored into the asking price, your chances of negotiating a lower number should be significantly improved.

“In the opposite type of market, buyers are in a far stronger position and can potentially leverage those types of things to their advantage,” explains Cunningham. “If you’re going to make a lower offer, make sure you’re well-armed with information that will help to rationalise that offer. From a purchaser’s point of view in these types of markets, information is king.”

What do I need to spend?

When it comes to acquiring such information, the first step is gaining access to the property with a builder or relevant tradesperson to understand what’s actually involved in making the necessary improvements of repairs. For instance: how much will it cost to put in new stars, replace the kitchen, or rip out the bathroom?

“Any negotiation leverage you might be able to achieve will be based on getting factual reports with actual rather than fictitious costs,” says Cunningham. “Get detailed quotes so you can ascertain those costs. Then to justify your lower offer, you can compare the final tally to the price that other houses in the area have sold for. Ultimately, it comes down to whether or not a prospective vendor cares or doesn’t care about whether they sell the property.”

Regardless of what a vendor response might be, Cunningham says you should never be afraid to make an offer that’s lower than the asking price.

“Remember: the market is the market – it’s determined by the sellers and the buyers.”

"The RBA met industry expectations today, announcing its decision to hold the official interest rate at the record low of 1.5 per cent for August. The cash rate last moved in August 2016, shifting down to the current rate.

Tim Lawless comments: With headline inflation tracking slightly below the 2-3% target range, labour markets tightening and the economy continuing to grow, albeit at a pace below trend, the chances of a rate cut appear to have diminished.  However, rate hikes may be some way off as well; recent declines in the US dollar and strengthening commodity prices have placed added pressure on the Australian dollar, which may reduce export demand. Financial markets indicate the cash rate won’t rise until late 2018.  
 
The housing market was likely a key topic of conversation when the RBA met today and decided to keep the cash rate on hold. CoreLogic’s home value index showed a strong capital gain result in June and July, however the trend rate of growth suggests that the hottest markets, Sydney and Melbourne, have lost some steam after the first quarter of 2017.   The slowdown in housing market conditions can also be seen in softer auction clearance rates relative to earlier in the year as well as higher inventory levels which is taking some of the urgency away from buyers.  
 
While the cash rate remained on hold, mortgage rates have been edging higher since late last year, particularly for investors and interest only loans.  Higher mortgage rates against a backdrop of record high household debt levels and record low rental yields are gradually taking some heat out of the housing market and this situation is likely to have a further dampening effect on investor exuberance as credit policies continue to evolve.

There were 1,712 properties taken to auction this week, up from 1,627 last week, and higher than this time last year, when 1,329 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 67.9 per cent was recorded. Based on the preliminary collection, all but one of the capital cities saw the clearance rate increase week-on-week.  Melbourne’s auction market has continued to show some resilience to softer auction conditions, recording the highest preliminary clearance rate at 79.4 per cent, although this is likely to revise lower when the final auction results are released on the following Thursday.  While Melbourne’s clearance rate has remained comfortably above 70 per cent since July last year, final auction results show Sydney’s auction clearance rate has been tracking below 70 per cent over the past six weeks, so it will be interesting to see if the preliminary clearance of 74.9 per cent is again revised below the 70 per cent mark.  Across Melbourne, preliminary results show that 79.4 per cent of the 676 reported auctions sold this week. There were 816 properties taken to auction across the city, up from 756 last week when the final clearance rate was recorded at 74.9 per cent. Over the same week last year, 572 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 71.6 per cent was recorded. The West region of Melbourne had the highest number of auctions this week (168), with a preliminary clearance rate of 76.4 per cent. However, the strongest rate of clearance was recorded across the North West region, where 90.1 per cent of the 71 reported auctions were successful. 5 of the 9 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 80.0 per cent.  Sydney was host to 613 auctions this week and a preliminary clearance rate of 74.9 per cent was recorded, rising from 69.2 per cent last week across 609 auctions. The final clearance rate for Sydney has been trending below 70 per cent for the last 6 weeks, although it has been nudging higher over the last two weeks. One year ago, 473 auctions were held across Sydney and 71.5 per cent were successful. Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, 7 of the 15 sub-regions recorded clearance rates above 75.0 per cent with the stand outs being the Northern Beaches (92.3 per cent), Eastern Suburbs (89.2 per cent), North Sydney and Hornsby (83.6 per cent) and City and Inner South (78.3 per cent) regions.  The preliminary clearance rate in Brisbane this week rose to 50.6 per cent, from 41.7 per cent last week. Auction volumes were slightly higher this week with 126 auctions held, up from 116 last week. Meanwhile, across the Gold Coast, 41.4 per cent of the 29 reported auctions were successful.  In Adelaide, a 69.0 per cent preliminary result was recorded this week across 73 auctions. Last week, 64 Adelaide auctions returned a clearance rate of 69.0 per cent for the city, while at the same time last year, 68 homes were taken to auction, with 56.3 per cent recording a successful result.  Perth’s clearance rate of 73.3 per cent across 15 auction results is up from last week, when 35 auctions were held and a clearance rate of 46.2 per cent was recorded. Over the same week last year, the clearance rate was a lower 33.3 per cent, and 22 auctions were held. Across Canberra, 46 homes were taken to auction this week. Preliminary results show a clearance rate of 73.3 per cent, up from 68.9 per cent the previous week. Tasmania was host to 3 auctions this week and so far no results have been reported.

Published: 25 July 2017",2021_04_23,25-Jul-17,N/A,Preliminary Figures Show 74.8% of Auctions Were Successful Across the Combined Capital Cities
"The number of properties being advertised for sale across the nation is much lower than it was a year ago.  Looking at the data, it indicates that the reduction in properties for sale is largely being driven by the regional housing markets rather than the capital cities.

CoreLogic counts properties for sale each week based on a rolling 28 day count.  The data is split between new listings, re-listings and total listings.  New listings are properties that we haven’t previously seen listed for sale over the past three month, re-listings are properties that have been listed for sale at least twice over the past three months and the sum of the two is total listings.

At a national level over the week ending 16/07/2017 there were 37,849 new listings over the past 28 days and 219,039 total listings.  New listings were 2.3% higher than a year ago while total listings were -6.0% lower.  Across the combined capital cities there were 23,138 new listings which was 5.7% higher than a year ago and 101,443 total listings which was -0.4% lower than a year ago.  Overall new listings are higher than a year ago and total listings are lower.  However, when comparing the capital city and national listing figures it indicates that new listings are being driven higher primarily by capital city markets while total listings are lower fueled by falls in stock across regional housing markets.

The charts we have provided highlight the number of properties advertised for sale at specific points in time over each of the past six years.  The current growth phase commenced in June 2012 so showing six calendar years provides an indication of stock levels before growth commenced and how that has evolved throughout the value growth phase.

Taking a look across the individual capital cities there are some dramatic differences in the number of properties available for sale relative to recent years.

Sydney

Vendors have become more active across Sydney with new listing numbers rising almost 17% compared with a year ago while total advertised stock levels across Sydney have risen to 21,300; 13.3% higher than the same time a year ago.  Sydney’s advertised stock levels are now higher than they have been over the preceding three years, providing buyers with more choice and potentially less urgency in their decision making.

Melbourne

There are more vendors bringing their properties to the market currently with new listings up 10.8% from last year to 7,091 while there are 27,191 total properties listed for sale which is 0.1% higher than a year ago.  Although both new and total listings are higher than they were last year, they are both lower than they were in 2015.

Brisbane

There are currently 3,906 new and 19,547 total properties advertised for sale across the city.  New listings are -2.9% lower than a year ago and at their lowest level for this time of year since 2013.  Total listings are -1.3% lower than they were a year ago however, they are higher than the preceding three years.

Adelaide

Over the past 28 days there were 1,792 new and 8,116 total properties advertised for sale in the city.  New listings are slightly higher (1.9%) than they were a year ago while total listings are 0.6% higher than last year and at their highest level for this time of year since 2013.

Perth

The city currently has 3,028 new and 20,476 total properties advertised for sale.  The number of new properties advertised for sale is -12.9% lower than a year ago and at its lowest level for this time of year since 2012.  The total number of properties advertised for sale remains elevated however, there are -10.7% fewer properties available for sale relative to last year despite total listings being higher than each of the other previous years shown.

Hobart

There are currently 324 newly advertised properties for sale in the city.  The number of new listings is 10.2% higher than a year ago however, new listings are lower than they were in each of the years between 2012 and 2015.  There are 1,271 total properties listed for sale in Hobart which is -29.2% lower than at the same time a year ago.  There has been an ongoing decline in the number of properties for sale in Hobart over recent years with total listings -62.6% lower than they were at the same time in 2012.

Darwin

Over the past four weeks there were 192 new properties advertised for sale and 1,640 total properties listed for sale.  The number of new properties for sale is 13.6% higher than a year ago but lower than each of the four years previous to last year.  Total listings are marginally higher than a year ago (0.2%) and higher than each of the years since 2012.  In fact, total listings are 62.9% higher than they were in 2012.

Canberra

Over the past 28 days there were 580 newly advertised properties for sale which was 33.6% higher than at the same time last year.  New property listings are currently higher than they were at this time each year since 2012.  The last four weeks has seen 1,872 total properties advertised for sale in Canberra which is 14.8% higher than a year ago.  Although total listings are higher than a year ago, they remain lower than they were in each year from 2012 to 2015.

In the markets that have seen very strong value growth over recent year, Sydney and Melbourne, there are significantly more new properties coming to the market relative to last year.  This could be an indication of some concern that the market is (or has) moving through its peak.  For the first time in a number of years Sydney buyers have a relatively larger pool of properties to choose from.  Brisbane and Adelaide are seeing fairly similar levels of stock on the market relative to recent years.  In Perth and Darwin stock for sale remains elevated however, while new and total stock is falling relative to last year in Perth, total listings continue to climb in Darwin.  Hobart has seen a significant reduction in stock available for sale which is driving buyer urgency and supporting the value growth which is currently occurring.  Finally in Canberra more stock is coming to the market which is leading to a slight lift in the total number of properties available for sale.

"Any amount you can claim on a property will be advantageous to your financial well being. Negative gearing is a popular wealth creation strategy. The net loss can be offset against other income to reduce tax which means the higher you can claim on a property, the bigger the tax benefit. Here are some of the tax deductions you can and cannot claim on negatively geared investments.

Capital gain is derived from the sale of a property where the proceeds are more than the cost base of the property.

There is a capital loss if the proceeds are less than the cost base. To minimise your CGT, you should know all expenses that fall within the property's cost base. You can apply capital losses from the previous year as well.

The cost base consists of the property's purchase price, stamp duty, borrowing expenses, broker fees, legal expenses, capital improvement outlays and auctioneer's fees.

Rental properties bought on or after 19 September 1985 are subject to capital gains tax but any remaining net capital gain can be reduced under the 50% CGT discount for those who owned the property for over 12 months. There are other concessions if it used to be your main residence as well.

You can also claim management expenses against the investment property's income, including insurance, interest on your investment loan, real estate management fees, depreciation on assets, council and water rates, tenancy costs including advertising, repairs and maintenance and cleaning costs. Until 30 June 2017, reasonable travel expenses to maintain, inspect and collect rent for the property may be claimed. For body corporate fees, you can claim admin levies and general purpose sinking funds as well.

To those whose rental property is in their name and not part of a property leasing business, you can reduce your tax on prepaid tax-deductible expenses if the prepayment is for services in the next 12 months. For others, a prepayment may only be deductible immediately if the expenditure is less than $1,000 or specifically required to be incurred by a law.

To claim, you have to present official documentation such as bank statements and receipts and accurate depreciation and capital works schedules.

The depreciation schedule outlines the amount you claim in depreciation every year while the capital works schedule outlines building and construction expenses, costs of altering a building, capital improvements to the surrounding property and how much you can claim every year. Expenses can be written off at 2.5% every year over 40 years for rental properties build after 15 September 1987.

Those who do not have building or construction records can obtain an estimate from a quantity surveyor, clerk of works, experienced builder or supervising architect.

A quantity surveyor can also create a depreciation schedule. They are experienced in valuing assets accurately to help you save money in the long run.

Meanwhile, expenses you cannot claim are those related to your personal use of the property, utility bills paid by the tenant, borrowing costs when you've borrowed against the investment property's equity for private use and those related to the sale or purchase of the property. However, many of these can be part of the cost base. You should document and keep all records of all your spending from the start of your investment.

PS.
You should document and keep all records of all your spending from the start of your investment. Talk to your accountant to understand what you need and map out what you want to do in the coming financial year.

"As of May, the cheapest 10% of houses in Sydney were valued at up to $604,762. In other words, even the lowest value houses in the greater Sydney metropolitan – from the eastern suburbs to Penrith – are expensive relative to other assets.

Meanwhile, in the heart of the Sydney CBD, over 100 offices sold for under $604,762 in the year to May 2017, Cityscope figures reveal. 

Of these 100 strata unit offices, the prices ranged from $87,000 to $600,000, and averaged $378,360.

The cheapest office sales were in the centre of Sydney’s business activity – Macquarie Street, King Street and Sussex Street. Interestingly, 6 of the 10 cheapest sales came from 368 Sussex Street, a 10 storey building established in 1973. The building is just minutes from Town Hall Station, World Square and a number of restaurants.

The lowest sale value was a room within 229 Macquarie Street. At just 26 m2, the property sold for $87,000 in July last year.

Small commercial spaces are relatively low in value for several reasons. Firstly, investors in commercial property are highly dependent on rental yield, rather than capital growth – and the initial price reflects these expectations. Whereas the lowest 10th percentile of Sydney houses saw capital growth of 11.4% in the year to May, capital growth in commercial properties is typically more subdued.

Additionally, these spaces are inappropriate for residential re-zoning. High yields in the residential space have caused some commercial property to be valued on its potential to be converted into houses or units. The cheap office spaces recorded as sold over the year in the Sydney CBD are located within high rise office buildings, with an average floor area of 46 m2. The minimum floor space for one bedroom apartments in New South Wales is 50m2.

The value of these properties is also limited because they are strata. In comparison, the cheapest non-strata office property was $4 million. The sale was of a 220 m2 building on a 76 m2 site at 66 Druitt Street, Sydney.

Finally, prospects for growth in office spaces, particularly small ones such as these, are potentially disrupted by increasingly remote workforces. The economies of scale that come from accommodating a workforce in one physical space, is reduced the smaller the company, and the smaller the office space. Emerging small businesses and start-ups may instead find communal office spaces more attractive, where workers can rent by the desk, by the day, and not have to commit to long term leases.

So are these offices a good investment? Given the small size of these office spaces, the per-square-metre price was not cheap. However, like with any investment, it is about paying the right price for the right return. Some of these low value office spaces have good rents. The highest rental yield associated with a transaction over the year was 6.7% on a 51m2 unit sold for $475,000 in Pitt Street. Depending on the terms of the loan for the property, such an investment would likely be positively geared.  

Assuming demand for offices in the Sydney CBD remains driven by strong economic performance, such purchases could present good investment opportunities, at a much lower price than the typical Sydney home.

"If you’ve been feeling a little lost amid the ever-changing lending policies, take heart. You’re not alone. And you’re not without options. There are finance strategies to help you deal with tighter lending policies by the banks. Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Propertymarketinsider.com.au explains

Despite the seemingly harsh moves by the banks recently, it’s worth remembering that mortgages are still their bread and butter.

This means they are still willing to lend to qualified borrowers.

However, the banks are also under a lot of pressure from the regulators to clamp down on investment lending. So they’re obliged to put in place measures to comply with APRA’s directive to keep their banking licence.

They have to tighten their lending policies. Even raising interest rates on investor loans to rein in investor demand.

So how should you deal with the current tighter lending?

Property Market Insider spoke with award-winning mortgage broker Marissa Schultze of Rise High Financial Solutions for her insights and top tips.

Finance Strategy #1: Weigh the merits of converting from Interest Only to Principal & Interest (P&I)

With the banks raising their rates on Interest Only loans by around 0.35%, it may be worth switching to Principal & Interest as we’ve suggested in our recent article on the counterintuitive strategies to consider now.

Schulze points out that there’s no right or wrong move. However, you need to consider a couple of things before switching.

“If you switch to P&I, you’d be paying principal on your loan, which will reduce the long term tax benefits associated with that investment property,” says Schulze.

There’s also the issue of cash flow. Because your repayments are higher, your cash flow may suffer, which could result in financial difficulty down the line.

“If you end up converting your investment loan to P&I, your higher repayments will bite into your cash flow each week. This will reduce your ability to pay down your bad debts which will not give you a good long-term outcome,” says Schulze.

So when should you consider switching to P&I repayments?

Before switching to P&I, consider taking the following steps.

Calculate and compare the repayments on the higher rate on the Interest Only loan against the lower rate on Principal & Interest.

If the difference is relatively small and you’re comfortable doing that, then you may want to go P&I according to Schulze.

“The benefit of converting to P&I right now is that you’re going to get a lower interest rate,” says Schulze.

Look at your current level of non-tax deductible debts.

If you have a high level of bad debts that are non-tax deductible, Schulze recommends that you focus on paying them down as a first priority.

This means that you keep your investor loan on Interest Only. That’s unless the P&I repayment is only slightly above the Interest Only repayment, in which case, it might make sense to switch P&I.

“I’ll only recommend P&I to investors who have a low level of bad debts such as personal loans or mortgages on their owner occupied home,” she says.

“I would never have previously recommended P&I to anyone that has any level of bad debt because they should be focusing on that and then tackle the Interest Only loan once that’s done.

“But now, things have changed. Some investors may have a really strong cash flow and have a small mortgage on their home. It’s starting to make sense because you’re saving 30-40 basis points on the interest rate.”

Finance Strategy #2: Embrace a lower loan to value ratio (LVR)

Another hot button issue is whether you should lower your overall loan to value ratio when borrowing.

Schulze explains that this move doesn’t make sense for some investors.

“It doesn’t make sense to lower your LVR drastically from a leverage perspective,” she says. “One of the great benefits of investing in property is the ability to leverage. You should maximise it as much as you can.”

However, Schulze concedes that from a finance point of view, a lower loan to value ratio will make it easier for you to secure a loan and even get a better mortgage rate.

“You’ll be more attractive to the banks if you have a lower LVR and you will be able to attract a more competitive interest rate as well,” she explains.

But how low should you go?

From an investment perspective, a higher LVR is still a smart strategy according to Schulze.

However, with APRA leaning on heavily on the banks, the ultra-high LVR loans are becoming scarce.

“Even at 90% LVR, you have very limited choices and you’re getting an expensive interest rate at that level,” says Schulze.

As such she believes the sweet spot is 80% LVR and under.

“If you can keep it at 80% LVR, that’s the ideal mark,” says Schulze. “If you have to borrow at 90% LVR, you still can. However, you’ll have fewer options as more lenders are going to move away from this space in the coming months.”

Schulze also points out that a high LVR loan such as 90% now requires a principal and interest repayment.

So not only that you’re paying a higher interest rate, you’re also getting slammed with an even higher repayment as you pay the principal component as well.

“I think 80% LVR is ideal. However, if it means getting into the market now at 90% LVR vs having to wait 2 years to get to 80% LVR, then there’s a merit to getting in now at 90%.

But you need to make sure you’re buying good quality assets that will go up in value,” advises Schulze.

Finance Strategy #3: Choose your broker wisely

With all these changes happening in the mortgage market, it’s important to work with someone who is experienced, knowledgeable and independent.

“Make sure you have the right mortgage broker working for you,” advises Schulze. “It’s impossible to stay across all lending. You also need to make sure you work with a really good mortgage broker with a broad panel of lenders.”

Schulze’s Top Insider Tips
Always maximise your borrowing capacity.
Keep a clean credit file. Don’t do too many inquiries.
As an investor, look at properties with good rental return. You need to have a good cash flow coming from the property because servicing is now harder.
Beware of brokers that are owned by a bank because their panel is limited.

"Over the past 20 financial years there have only been two years in which combined capital city dwelling values have fallen.

Over the last financial year, combined capital city dwelling values increased by 9.6% which was actually greater than the 8.3% rise over the 2015-16 financial year.  Combined capital city dwelling values have now increased over five successive financial years however, prior to these increases there were successive financial years in which values fell (-1.4% in 2010-11 and -3.6% in 2011-12).  Across the individual capital cities the growth story over recent financial years has been vastly different.

Sydney

Dwelling values increased by 12.2% over the past year and it was the fifth successive year in which values rose.  Value growth was slightly higher than the 11.3% over the previous financial year.

Melbourne

Values have now increased for five successive financial years with each of those years progressively seeing a faster rate of value growth.  Over the past year, values increased by 13.7% which was their greatest increase over a financial year since 2009-10.

Brisbane

A 2.0% increase in values over the past financial year was down on the 5.3% the previous year.  Brisbane values have increased over each of the past five years however, last year was the slowest rate of growth since 2012-13.

Adelaide

The 2.4% rise in values over the past year eclipsed the 2.1% increase the previous year and marked the fifth consecutive financial year in which values increased.

Perth

Dwelling values have fallen over each of the past three financial years however, the rate of decline has slowed from -4.7% in 2015-16 to -1.3% in 2016-17.  At no other time over the past 20 years have values fallen over three successive financial years in Perth.

Hobart

The 6.8% increase in dwelling values over the past financial year was the greatest increase in values over a financial year since they rose by 8.5% in 2005-06.

Darwin

Dwelling values have fallen for three successive financial years. The -7.0% fall in values over the year was the largest annual decline since values fell by -12.6% over the 2010-11 financial year.

Canberra

Values rose by 9.6% over the last financial year which was the greatest rise in values over a financial year since 2009-10 when values increased by 13.3%.

In most capital cities, the rate of value growth over the past financial year was superior to that over the previous year. The exceptions were Brisbane and Darwin. A number of cities recorded their greatest increases in values in a number of years highlighting that the rate of growth has been accelerating.

Two of the primary factors influencing the rebound in capital gains during the most recent financial year was the rebound in investment activity after 2015/16 saw investment activity slow on the back of changed prudential policies implemented by APRA as well as successive rate cuts in May and August last year that added further incentive to property buyers. 

With a new round of macroprudential policies announced at the end of March this year, its likely there will be a similar, if not more pronounced slowdown in investment activity across the housing market. Coupled with affordability constraints and higher mortgage rates, we expect the 2017/18 financial year will record a less substantial rate of capital gains that what was seen in 2016/17.

"The number of homes taken to auction across the capital cities has fallen for the 4th week in a row, with just 1,612 auctions held this week, down from 1,766 last week, although higher than this time last year when 1,391 properties went under the hammer. The combined capital city preliminary clearance rate increased to 72.4 per cent this week, up from the final clearance rate of 68.4 per cent last week, although this will revise as more results are collected. The final clearance rate has nudged slightly higher over the last two weeks after reaching a year to date low of 66.5 per cent; it will be interesting to see if this is still the case on Thursday when the final figures are released. Adelaide and Brisbane were the only cities to see a slight increase in auction volumes this week, while Melbourne had the highest number of auctions scheduled (753). In terms of preliminary clearance rates, Melbourne was the best performing city with 77.4 per cent of the 667 results recording a successful result, and although this result will revise lower as the final results are collected, it is likely to be stronger than what we have seen in Melbourne over the last month.  Across Melbourne, 77.4 per cent of the 667 reported auctions sold this week. There were 753 auctions held across the city this week, falling from 818 last week when the final clearance rate was 72.9 per cent, but higher than one year ago when 667 homes went to auction and a clearance rate of 76.1 per cent was recorded. The West region of Melbourne had the highest number of auctions this week (138), with a preliminary clearance rate of 68.8 per cent. Meanwhile, the strongest clearance rate was recorded across the Outer East, with 90.9 per cent of the 55 reported auctions clearing, followed by the South East region with a clearance rate of 86.2 per cent.  In Sydney, 600 properties were taken to auction this week with a preliminary clearance rate of 72.9 per cent, increasing from last week, when the final clearance rate for the city was 68.6 per cent across 656 auctions. One year ago, 470 Sydney homes were taken to auction and the clearance rate was 74.9 per cent. Looking at the sub-regions of Sydney, the Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury region recorded the strongest clearance rate of 94.1 per cent across 21 auctions, followed by the Eastern Suburbs (84.2 per cent), while the North Sydney and Hornsby region had the highest volume of auctions (84), and recorded a clearance rate of 76.9 per cent.  There were 116 Brisbane homes taken to auction this week, with 87 results reported so far. The preliminary clearance rate for the city is 44.8 per cent, down from 55.7 per cent last week and lower than one year ago, when 47.0 per cent of the 120 properties taken to auction were successful. Across the Gold Coast 14 results have been reported so far, with a success rate of 64.3 per cent.  This week, Adelaide saw a preliminary clearance rate of 75.0 per cent, with 36 reported results across a total of 65 scheduled auctions. In comparison, over the previous week Adelaide’s clearance rate was 59.6 per cent and 54.7 per cent one year ago.  There were 33 Perth auctions this week and so far 18 results have been reported, with 44.4 per cent selling. Last week 36.4 per cent of the 22 reported auctions were successful. Canberra’s preliminary auction clearance rate of 72.7 per cent across 39 auctions is higher than both last week, when the final auction clearance rate was 62.7 per cent, and last year (63.3 per cent). Tasmania saw 6 auctions take place this week and 5 results have been reported so far, with 3 sales.

"The housing data from the 2016 Census highlights the increase in housing stock between 2011 and 2016, highlighting the changing type of housing being developed in our capital cities.

Data from the latest Census (2016) shows that there has been a large uplift in the number of dwellings across the capital cities between 2011 and 2016.  Between the two Census periods, Canberra has seen the greatest percentage increase in total housing stock followed by Melbourne, Darwin and Perth.  These four cities have each seen their housing stock increase by more than 11% over the five years.  While the nation has been in the midst of a dwellings construction boom over recent years, the total volume of housing stock increased by a lower proportion in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart between 2011 and 2016 than they did between 2006 and 2011.

Total increase in capital city housing
between 2011 and 2016 Census

The second chart splits out the data from the first chart into the three main types of housing as reported in the Census: separate house, semi detached, terrace, townhouse etc and flat, unit or apartment.  The data highlights that over the five years between Census there has been a shift towards denser housing stock being added to the capital cities.  Interestingly, while driving around inner city areas you would be led to believe that it is higher density units which have been most abundant in new supply, the data points to medium density supply having ramped up the most.  In Sydney (17.9%), Melbourne (61.0%), Brisbane (29.6%), Adelaide (46.5%), Perth (49.4%) and Canberra (36.9%) it was medium density housing types which recorded the greatest increase in stock over the five years.  In each of these cities, except for Adelaide and Perth, separate house stock saw the smallest increase of the three housing types over the five years.

Increase in capital city housing by product type
between 2011 and 2016 Census

The third chart highlights data from the 2016 Census showing the proportion of total housing stock by type.  Note that the Census also has two other types of housing defined as ‘other’ and ‘dwelling structure not stated’.  Across each capital city, separate houses remain the dominant property type however, given the previously presented data, the proportion of separate houses has fallen over recent Census periods.  Despite this, in most capital cities, medium and high density housing remain a relatively small but increasing proportion of the overall housing mix.

Proportion of total housing stock by
type across the capital cities

10 years ago in Sydney, 61.7% of housing stock was separate houses, in the latest Census 55.7% of housing stock was separate houses.  If this trajectory continues by the 2026 Census less than half of Sydney’s housing stock will be separate houses. 

This data highlights the changing nature of housing in capital cities.  With ongoing under investment in much needed infrastructure there are generally significant lifestyle benefits associated with living closer to the city centre however, the supply of land in the areas closer to the city centre is limited.  This is leading to increasing levels of medium and higher density dwelling construction and premiums for detached housing located close to the city centres.  Although approvals for these types of properties has slowed recently, it is anticipated that construction of medium and high density dwellings will remain elevated relative to historic levels.  The shift towards a greater proportion of capital city housing being medium and high density is expected to continue over the coming years.

"By now, you’ve probably heard about the strategy known as group buying as a way to buy under market value.

Currently the flavour of the month for first home buyers struggling to break into the property market and for investors looking for juicy deals, group buying is taking over the property market by a storm.

While there are obvious advantages to this strategy, there are also hidden traps for the unwary.

Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Propertymarketinsider.com.au explains.

How does group buying work?

Bulk buying is a simple concept. You band together with friends or people you know who are looking to buy similar investment to you and present yourselves to an agent as a group.

From here, you can use your people power to negotiate on price.

The other option is to work with companies that are offering these service.

“The easiest route would be to go to a buyer’s agent who has existing relationships with numerous agents and developers,” says Samara Metri, Head of Property Acquisition at DPP. “You would usually have a buyer’s agent, a property consultant or sales agent negotiate the deal.”

Bulk buying has been around for years and has been used successfully by buyer’s agents such as Nathan Birch, co-founder of BInvested.com.au.

“You buy food at shops in bulk and save so why not with a property? This is a proven strategy that’s worked for us for almost a decade now,” says Birch.

But here’s no such thing as free lunch. These deals come with a hefty price tag.

Depending on the buyer’s agent, you can be charged anywhere between $10,000 and $15,000 per deal. This is roughly how much you pay a buyer’s agent to find a property for you.

What types of properties are up for grabs?

Some buyer’s agents target older and established apartments while others like Birch works with developers who need to get enough pre-sales to get finance from the bank.

This means buying off-the-plan.

“Developers planning to build an estate typically need to sell off a number of properties before they can begin development, in order to secure finance from the banks,” explains Birch.

“A lot of legwork, marketing and promotion go into finding and securing these buyers ahead of the build. Some developers have seen us as an easy outlet for removing all the stress and pain from doing large marketing campaigns.”

Birch explains that by bringing a significant number of buyers together to approach the developer, “you can negotiate a deal on a significant portion of the blocks of land in the development and secure property well below market value.”

Metri used the same strategy to secure a recent deal in North West Sydney.

“Recently I came across a land release in North West Sydney, where there were only 9 lots available. Knowing I had 9 buyers (including myself) ready to go, I was able to negotiate a price with the developer where there is usually no negotiation off the set price when the lots are sold individually,” she explains.

But there are hidden traps for the eager buyers

While buying a property under market value through bulk buying is attractive, there are pitfalls you need to be aware of. These include:

Buying an inferior property in a low growth area

What looks like a ‘good deal’ and ’negotiated price' could turn out to be a dud property in an area with no growth potential.

“You need to ask why that property developer or seller need to bulk sell,” warns Zoran Solano of Hot Property Buyers Agency. “Is it an inferior property that they’re struggling to sell? Is it something to do with the location? Cheap isn’t always good. In fact, cheap can often be bad.”

Buying in a poor development

It’s easy to get dazzled by the hefty discounts but you could be buying into a poor development. “Make sure you research the area you are purchasing in, they may be giving you a great deal, however, this could be due to slow sales movement in the area,” says Metri.

Heightened competition from other investors

You might be getting a bargain by buying with other investors, but you’ll also end up competing with them.

Metri explains:

“Let’s say a buyer’s agent managed to secure 10 investments for a group buy. Those are 10 properties right next to each other, vacant and on the market all at the same time. This could result in long vacancy periods and you may have to compromise rent in order to get a tenant into the property.”

The sudden flood of rental supply in the area creates an oversupply and likely result to drop in rental yield and value according to Solano.

“That ripple effect of dropping a big stone in a small still pond could make an impact on the existing dwelling especially if they’re buying below market value,” says Solano.

You may not get finance to settle the deal

At a time when the regulators are clamping down on investor lending, you might find yourself unable to secure a mortgage to settle your property.

If your financial situation changes altogether such as starting a family or going from dual income to single income, your ability to borrow a loan be severely affected.

“If one purchaser fails on finance it could compromise the whole deal,” says Metri. “Make sure everyone is pre-approved and ready to go so you can move quickly.”

That’s also why Birch says he spends a significant amount of time vetting each buyer beforehand to remove any likelihood of last minute rejections. However, he admits there is never a complete certainty.

“I vet everyone’s financial position through a finance strategist to make sure there’s no chance they’re knocked back,” says Birch.

Your buyer’s agent may be double or even triple dipping

“If you’re outlying that much money, say $15k, you need to be confident you’re getting service and value for that fee,” says Solano.

“Is the person facilitating the deal getting income from other third parties? Are the builders incentivising them to refer building works for them? Are they getting kickbacks from the selling agents who might be brokering the deal to sell these 100 or so lots? These are all questions that you need to ask.”

The discounted price you pay becomes the new value for the property

One thing that most buyers don’t realise is that once you’ve bought a property at below market value, the low price you paid becomes its new value.

This will make it difficult to onsell it as the next buyer will see how much you paid for and will know the real value of the property.

The development may not proceed

Even with pre-sales already secured, there’s a chance that the development may not go ahead if the developer goes bust or decides to bail out.

It’s important that you do rigorous due diligence on the property developer to make sure they have a solid track record of delivering quality products on time.

Buying an overvalued property disguised as bargain

It’s entirely possible to pay too much for a property even at a steep discount. Because property values depend largely on comparable sales, all it takes is for one valuer to over-estimate a particular property or development to justify a higher asking price on your target property.

The property may be unsuitable to your own strategy

Any investment property you’re buying needs to be tailored to you as an individual purchaser, not the other way around.

There’s a risk in trying to make the area or property fit to your strategy.

Therefore, you should choose a property that will deliver your desired result, not just because it’s discounted.

It’s risky to think you are picking up a bargain but it may underperform over time and cost a lot of money and opportunity cost in the long term.

As you can see, buying a discounted property can be risky if you’re going into it blindly. Make sure you do your own due diligence and examine the deal vigorously.

"With dwelling values rising at a faster pace than household incomes, housing affordability has worsened over the first quarter of 2017.  CoreLogic measures housing affordability across four measures and three of these four measures have seen affordability deteriorate over the quarter. The four affordability measures that CoreLogic calculate are:

Dwelling price to household income ratio – essentially how many years of gross annual household income are required to purchase a property outright
Years to save a deposit – how many years of gross annual household income are required for a 20% deposit
Serviceability – calculating mortgage repayments on an 80% loan to value ratio (LVR) mortgage utilising the standard variable mortgage rate and a 25 year mortgage, what proportion of gross annual household income is required to service a mortgage
Dwelling rent to household income – the proportion of gross annual household income required to pay the rent

The measures we look at utilise median household incomes which have been modeled by the Australian National University (ANU). 

As at March 2017, the national price to income ratio was recorded at 7.3 compared to 7.2 a year earlier, 6.4 five years earlier and 6.1 a decade ago.  Looking at houses and units, the ratios were recorded at 7.4 and 6.7 respectively at March 2017. 

It would have taken 1.5 years of gross annual household income for a deposit nationally at the end of the March 2017 quarter.  This is compared to 1.4 years a year earlier, 1.3 years five years ago and 1.2 years a decade ago.  If saving for a house it would take 1.5 years of the median household income for a deposit compared to 1.3 years of income for a unit.

The calculation of the proportion of household income required to service a mortgage is very sensitive to mortgage rates.  At the end of March 2017, the discounted variable mortgage rate for owner occupiers was 4.55% and a mortgage required 38.9% of a household’s income.  A year earlier mortgage rates were 4.85% and the mortgage used 39.6% of the household income.  Five years ago, mortgage rates were 6.7% and a decade ago they were 7.45% and households required 42.2% and 42.8% of their household income respectively to service a mortgage.  Further to this you can see that the proportion of household income required to service a mortgage peaked at 51.0% in June 2008 when mortgage rates were 8.85%.  Houses currently require 39.39% of a household’s income to service a mortgage compared to units requiring 36.0%.

The final affordability measure looks at the alternative to taking out a mortgage, renting, looking at the rent to income ratio.  The rent to income ratio has been more stable compared with measures related to purchasing a home or servicing a mortgage, as it is more limited by growth in household incomes.  In March 2017, the ratio was recorded at 29.6% compared to 30.4% a year earlier, 29.1% five years earlier and 25.8% a decade ago.  At the end of March 2017 the ratio was recorded at 29.6% for houses and units.

The above table highlights each of the four housing affordability measures across the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) regions as at March 2017.  Capital cities are generally more expensive across all measures than regional markets despite household incomes generally being higher in capital cities.  Sydney is the least affordable housing market across most measures.  Sydney’s price to income ratio is significantly higher than all other regions analysed.  Furthermore, the serviceability calculation shows that despite mortgage rates being at close to historic low levels, a Sydney property owner is utilising 45% of their household income to service their mortgage. This data provides a snapshot of how housing affordability is tracking across the country, and it highlights how in Sydney and Melbourne in particular it is deteriorating as dwelling values have risen over recent years. Another important point to note is that lower mortgage rates make servicing debt easier however, it doesn’t make it easier to overcome the deposit hurdle, particularly given fairly sluggish household income growth over recent years.  The data also suggests that servicing a mortgage remains more expensive than paying for rental accommodation although the gap has narrowed as interest rates have fallen. It is important to look at a range of housing affordability measures and analyse them over time to get a true understanding of the housing affordability challenges.  Over recent years affordability on a price to income and saving for a deposit basis has deteriorated in Sydney and Melbourne however it is relatively unchanged or slightly improved in most other capital cities.  On the other hand, as mortgage rates have fallen servicing a mortgage has required a lower proportion of household income which in turn has allowed some owners to reinvest or increase their spending elsewhere.

"When it comes to property investing, what you don’t know can hurt you financially.

Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Propertymarketinsider.com.au reveals some property investment truths experts don’t talk about.

If you own an investment property or two, you know that there’s more to it than simply buying and holding and never selling.

It’s not just buying a few property and waiting for it to double in value. No, there are many hard decisions and even harder work you need to do to succeed as an investor.

But of course, no one talks about them.

Instead of telling you that you that you need to spend many hours learning the ropes and researching, they’d tell you to just get a mentor or buyers agent to sort out the investment for you.

Instead of encouraging you to be rational and really think through your purchase, these experts would pressure you to make a decision quickly.

They tell you that all you need to do is trust the system and you’ll be fine.

Guess what? That’s where losses are made.

The truth is, these so-called experts are in the business to make money of you. Plain and simple. While some may not be outrightly lying, others are purposely glazing over what it takes to succeed.

Here are some truths that experts don’t want you to know when investing in property.
There’s no shortcut to property investing.

It takes time to understand the market. If you think you can just buy “off the shelf” and get rich, you’re kidding yourself and exposing your financial future.

You really need to understand why such a property is a good investment. What proof is there to show that it’s got potential?

Experts often push you to just “trust” their research as they’ve been doing it for a long time.

But remember, it’s your money. Make sure you fully understand what you’re buying. This means doing your rigorous due diligence. This takes time.

Don’t get pressured into an investment that you’re not sure about.

There’s no such thing as sure investment

If there is, all of us would be doing it. The truth is, no matter how much research you do or how reputable your mentor is, you can still get it wrong.

And don’t think that just because an area or property has been growing solidly over the long term means that you’re sure to make a profit. This is by no means an indication of a guaranteed growth in the future.

However, there are ways to reduce of buying a dud. This includes researching thoroughly and verifying every stats and claim made by experts.

It takes time for property values to grow

Generally, property values have doubled in value every 8 years or so. This is not the rule and this doesn’t happen to every market. Some markets will see faster growth, while others may take longer.

When investing in property, it’s important to realise that you need to hold your investment over the long term to make a profit. If you’re forced to sell prematurely, you could lose your investment.

Market dynamics could change for the worse

Just because an area is in high demand doesn’t mean that your property is always going to be tenanted. There are a number of things outside of your control that could impact your investment.

Just look at what happened to Perth. At the height of the mining boom around 2011, investors were racking up massive rents from FIFO who were willing to pay just about anything for a room. When the downturn hit, these same landlords found themselves struggling to get their properties rented.

Experts don’t often want to focus on what could go wrong, which is why you should. And make sure you factor this in your decision.

More isn’t always better

It makes for a good current affair story but buying 10, 20 or 100 properties isn’t always the best strategy.

But since your mentor or advisor is doing it, you may think you should do it too.

The truth is, you just need a handful of good quality properties that you can hold comfortably over the long term. This way, you can truly focus on boosting and extracting values from them rather than having 20 properties that you aren’t optimising.

It’s expensive to hold a property

A lot of experts focus on the buying and not what happens afterwards. But your ability to hold the property over the long term will determine whether you’ll succeed or not.

You need to factor in vacancies which are common as well as mortgage rate increases. There are maintenance issues you need to deal with even for new properties. If your cash flow falls short, you could be forced to sell at a loss.

"First home buyers are close to record lows in many of Australia’s states and they are below the long term average in every state except Western Australia.  As at the end of April 2017, first home buyers comprised just 13.9% of all owner occupier mortgage demand nationally.  The situation is worse in New South Wales, where first time buyers comprised only 8.4% of the market over the first four months of the year so far; based on the long term average, first home buyers ‘normally’ comprise around one fifth of owner occupier demand across New South Wales.

With first home buyer participation declining as prices rise, it’s an easy connection to suggest that housing affordability is to blame for the low participation rate, but that is probably only part of the reason.  South Australia, for example, doesn’t have the same affordability challenges as New South Wales, yet first time buyers are the second lowest of any state at 12.2% and first time buyer activity in Victoria (16.6%) is more substantial than participation in Tasmania (15.2%) where housing is the most affordable of any state.

Availability of jobs is an important factor for first home buyers and this is likely to be one of the factors supporting first time buyer demand in Victoria, even though stamp duty rates (prior to July 1) are high and affordability measures are the second highest of any capital city outside of Sydney.   Over the past five years 39% of the jobs created nationally have been in Victoria which is substantially higher than the long term average of 24%.

The two states where first time buyers are most active, at least on a proportional basis, are Western Australia, where first time buyers comprise 28.4% of owner occupier mortgage demand, and Queensland at 21.5%.  First home buyers are higher than the long term average in Western Australia and Queensland first timers are close to the long term average participation rates.  Jobs growth has been mild across both states over the past five years, however housing prices have been tracking lower in Perth and increasing roughly in line with incomes in Brisbane.  The dwelling price to income ratio in Brisbane is 5.9 and in Perth its 6.0; substantially lower than the larger capital cities.  It’s likely that the healthier affordability of housing in these regions, despite the mild jobs growth, is a primary factor in supporting first time buyer demand.

Other factors come back to transaction costs, particularly the cost of stamp duty and deposit.  There is a high likelihood that stamp duty exemptions for first home buyers, which go live on July 1st in Victoria and New South Wales will temporarily boost first time buyer numbers in the market.  While the exemptions are likely to drive first home buyer demand, it’s likely that additional demand concentrated across the lower priced end of the market could simply push prices higher over the short to medium term.

"The latest housing finance and housing credit data confirm that the level of activity from investors in the housing market is slowing.

Australian mortgage lenders have been rationing credit to the investor segment and lifting mortgage rates and these changes are starting to bite with investor demand now slowing.  It remains to be seen if this slowdown lasts or, if once these limits are eased the investor segment of the market comes back to residential property.

Since August 2015, Australian mortgage lenders have been charging interest rate premiums for investors.  While standard variable mortgage rates for owner occupiers were recorded at 5.45% in August 2015, the same mortgage type for investors had a mortgage rate of 5.75% or a 30 basis point premium.  Since August 2015, the cash rate has fallen by 50 basis points however, mortgage rates have not shown the same decline.  At the end of May 2017, standard variable mortgage rates were recorded at 5.3% for owner occupiers and 5.8% for investors.  Despite two 25 basis point interest rate cuts since August 2015, owner occupier mortgages rates are only 15 basis points lower while investor mortgage rates are 5 basis points higher and have a premium of 50 basis points compared to a typical owner occupier mortgage.

Indicator mortgage lending rates

The mortgage rate premium for investors appears to finally be biting into the market with weakness in both total investor credit and investor housing finance commitments.  The April 2017 lending aggregates data from the Reserve Bank (RBA) showed that investor credit rose by 0.55% over the month, its lowest monthly increase since August 2016.  At the same time, April 2017 housing finance data shows there was $12.6 billion in investor housing finance commitments over the month, the lowest value since September 2016.  Since August and September of last year, standard variable mortgage rates for investors have risen by 30 basis points compared to a 5 basis point increase for owner occupiers.

There are individual states and territories in which a slowdown in mortgage demand by investors will have more of an impact, namely New South Wales and Victoria. 

Monthly value of investor housing finance
commitments, state and territories

Tasmania is the only state or territory where the value of lending to housing investors is currently rising however, in terms of the value of lending to investors, New South Wales and Victoria account for a substantial majority of overall lending.  This is partly a function of higher housing costs in these two states, nevertheless, New South Wales accounted for 49.3% of all investor lending nationally in April 2017 with Victoria accounting for 27.4%. A pull-back in lending to investors is inherently likely to have more of an impact on the New South Wales (Sydney) and Victorian (Melbourne) housing markets.

The potential impact on the New South Wales and Victorian housing markets of an investor slowdown is further highlighted in the final charts.  Excluding refinances (which are also trending lower) investors accounted for 55.3% of mortgage demand in New South Wales in April 2017 and 46.8% in Victoria.  In all other states and territories investors accounted for less than 40% of mortgage demand in April 2017, with the proportion trending lower over recent months in most regions.

as a proportion of total (excluding refinances),
state and territories

It is anticipated that investor demand will continue to slow over the coming months.  Lenders are continuing to re-price mortgage rates for investors and we are yet to see the full impact of the policy changes designed to slow the level of interest-only lending.  With investor demand likely to continue to fade, it is expected that this will also contribute to a further slowing of the rate of value growth in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets where investor demand has been significantly greater than it has been elsewhere.

A reduction in the pace of capital gains will add further disincentive to investors.  Considering that rental yields in Sydney and Melbourne are close to record lows, we can assume most investors are focussed on the prospects for capital growth and relying on a negative gearing strategy to offset the cash flow losses.  If investors anticipate the prospects for capital gains have dissipated we may see investment demand deflect to those markets where the growth cycle is less mature than Sydney and Melbourne’s and where rental yields haven’t been depleted as substantially.

"The 2016 Census data reveals how people are dealing with unaffordable housing in the capital cities.

While wage growth sits at a record low 1.9% against higher costs in basic needs like housing and health, and consumer confidence hits a 12 month low of 96.23, it is no wonder that people are paying more attention than ever to events such as the Census.

A flush of new data gives a clearer perspective of the state of Australian households, and how households are changing in response to factors such as housing affordability and low income growth.

Share Housing is Increasing to Keep Up With Rising Housing Costs

The 2016 Census data reveals how people are dealing with unaffordable housing in the capital cities: a rapid increase in group households.
A group household is one that consists of two or more unrelated people, where all residents are 15 or over. The national increase in group households in the 5 years to 2016 was 10.5%. This is lower than the group household increase between 2006 and 2011 (which was 14.35%, and coincided with a 5 year rent increase of over 38%).

However, the group household type grew rapidly compared to a 7% rise in the number of total households, and 7% in the number of single households across Australia.

Where there has been high house price pressures such as in Sydney, the number of share households rose by an astonishing 18% from the previous census against a total household rise of approximately 7%, and compared with 9% growth in group households between 2006 and 2011.

The growth in the number of lone households in the 5 years to 2016 – that is, people living by themselves – grew 2.2%. Of 1.5 million singles living in Sydney, approximately 350,000 people are living by themselves. The number of people per household in Sydney rose to 2.8 from 2.7 at the previous Census.

While there are a number of social and demographic trends that may explain the increase in group households – such as people marrying later in life and still qualifying as a ‘group’ household – it is important to further investigate the relationship between increasing rents and deposit hurdles, and the incidents of share housing. Indeed, the decision to marry later in life could be the result of being unable to attain a family home earlier.

The Cost of Servicing a Mortgage Declined for Homeowners

As reported in the quarterly CoreLogic Perceptions of Housing Affordability report, the toughest barrier to entry in the housing market is the deposit hurdle, while mortgage servicing costs have declined with interest rates. The 2016 Census data suggests that since 2011, the typical household mortgage repayment across the capital cities was either unchanged, or fell (with the exception of Darwin).

The 2011 Census was taken average standard variable rate was 7.8%. By the 2016 census it had fallen to 5.25%. Thus lower interest rates likely reduced the cost of outstanding mortgages through refinancing opportunities, while new home owners also benefitted from lower interest rates, despite those same low interest rates encouraging rapid price increases in several of the capital cities.

The Share of Vacant Dwellings on Census Night Increased

Vacant homes are another contentious issue in the Census. In the context of high housing pressures and a perception of limited housing supply, anecdotes of investment properties bought and left vacant.

At the time of the census, 11.2% of dwellings were recorded as unoccupied – which worked out at 1,089,165 dwellings across Australia. This was a little higher than the previous census result of 10.2% or 934,471 dwellings.

At the time of the 2016 Census, CoreLogic saw a typical vacancy rate of about 5.3% associated with market turnover. Extrapolating that figure to the census dwelling count of 9,901,496 suggests that market turnover could account for 524,779 of the vacant dwellings at the time of the census.

Furthermore, the highest level of vacant properties from the 2011 Census were actually in areas associated with holiday making in the east, such as coastal Victoria and regional NSW, rather than in areas of high residential demand.

In the 2016 Census results, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had vacancy rates of 7.7%, 9.6% and 8% respectively, below the national figure of 11.2%. It is worth noting that these capital city dwelling vacancy rates were each higher than the 2011 Census results.

Higher levels of unoccupied stock provide some credence to the notion that some properties are being purchased without an intention to tenant them, however at a broad capital city level the trend looks mild. This phenomenon is most evident within inner city unit markets. The Melbourne CBD for example, saw an uplift in vacant dwellings from 14.9% in the 2011 Census to 16.2% in 2016. While strong capital growth in Melbourne CBD dwellings (of 25.7% between the 2011 and 2016 Census) supports continued dwelling construction to meet investment demand, rental income for vacant dwellings may be desirable once interest rates rise, and capital gain returns soften.

"Sometimes the smartest thing to do is to go against the grain and explore some counterintuitive strategies if you want to hedge your bets during a downturn. Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Property Market Insider explains.

Believe what you want to believe. But the party appears to be coming to an end at least for the Sydney property market.

Of course, there are still some of us who refuse to see the reality. We continue to cling to hopes and beliefs that somehow there’s some hidden driver that will propel the market to another stratospheric high.

The stats show otherwise. Auction clearance rates are falling (Week ending 11 June was 71% for Sydney and 77% for Melbourne). At the same time, the number of properties listed for sale has also increased dramatically according to Corelogic.

So amid the growing evidence of a market slowdown and tightening regulations, it’s time to re-examine your strategies to strengthen your portfolio and avoid gut-wrenching losses.

Here are some strategies that go against the advice by many experts but could be your saving grace during a downturn.

Counterintuitive strategies to consider now
1. Sit tight for now.

Sometimes the best move is not to move at all. As investors, it’s in our nature to want to be in action and take part of the action.

It’s difficult to sit still when the market is going crazy. But taking a seat on the sidelines and watching how things will play out over the short term may actually benefit you.

Remember that you don’t have to be fully invested all the time.

It’s important to know when to hold off, even for a short while. That time is now.

Let people do all the crazy things they do when they’ve succumbed to irrational exuberance and FOMO.

2. Consider Principal & Interest (P&I) payment.

Yes, you’ll have to pay higher mortgage repayments and you can’t claim a tax deduction on the principal component. But there are huge benefits to paying P&I in the current climate.

Firstly, it helps you pay off your mortgage faster and reduce your risk during uncertain times. Paying principal on your loan also increases your equity faster.

The other reason is that the banks are tightening their lending policies on Interest Only loans so, in the end, you may not have a choice.

Recently, the major banks have raised mortgage interest rates on the Interest Only loans and some have cut rates on their P&I loans, which is another incentive to consider this option.

With interest rates still low, your P&I repayments will make a bigger dent in your debt. When the interest rates go up, likely next year, then you’re already well ahead.

3. Reduce your overall LVR (Loan to Value ratio).

No doubt there are benefits of high LVR loans: You can spread your cash and buy more properties. This helps you build your property portfolio faster.

However, having a high level of debt against your properties places you in a vulnerable position when your properties become vacant or you lose your income.

By reducing your debts through extra repayments or paying a higher deposit, you’re also lowering your risks and exposure when interest rate rises again.

Having a lower level of borrowing also places you in good stead with the banks as you’re considered a low-risk borrower.

4. Hold off on a major renovation.

During uncertain times as we’re currently experiencing now, it’s best to hold off on your renovation.

While there’s a potential to increase the value of your property through a smart upgrade, you’re probably not going to see a significantly higher capital gains or even an increase in rental yield.

That’s because, during economic uncertainties, tenants are less willing to pay more for a nicer rental home. People tend to conserve their cash and therefore look for the cheapest acceptable rental they can find.

This doesn’t mean you forgo maintenance altogether. You still need to keep your investment property in a rentable state. However, hold off making any significant upgrades until the markets stabilise or start rising again.

Published:10 July, 2017.",2021_04_23,10-Jul-17,N/A,4 Counterintuitive Strategies You May Want to Consider Now
"Ask the agent

Your first and most obvious port of call (but certainly not your last) should be the agent in charge of the sale. Ask if there’s anything you should be aware of?  For instance: how’s the sewage? What’s the wiring like? Any past termite activity? Always be proactive and specific in your requests and don’t expect them to automatically be in possession of all relevant information.

“In most cases the vendor and the agent are aware of all the pertinent issues, such as any relating to the property itself, the street, the neighborhood, and even the surrounding topography,” says Real Estate Institute of NSW President John Cunningham. “It’s up to you to make sure you ask all the right questions.”

Consult a building report

Building reports can be a great source of information and are regularly made available by agents and vendors prior to a sale. However, it pays to understand how and why such reports are written when evaluating their conclusions.

“Remember, reports are done to protect the person who’s done the report, so knowing how to read one is really important,” says Cunningham. “They’re always written from the worst-case scenario using interpretive words like ‘adequate’ and ‘inadequate’. But what do they really mean? If something’s ‘adequate’, for example, it’s probably actually pretty good. It’s important to understand that no building is perfect and that ultimately, you’ll still have to rely on your own knowledge and determinations to make a decision.”

Get a professional in

If you’ve got a friend who’s a builder, carpenter or plumber, now’s the time to offer them a case of craft beer in return for a walk-through and assessment. Alternatively, paying for the relevant building professionals to give a place a detailed once-over is also a smart investment.

“Get them to do a walk through the property with you and actually give you a real assessment of what’s involved in making any necessary improvements or repairs,” says Cunningham. “Because building reports also often over-estimate the cost of repairs, it’s good to get a professional opinion on what costs are actually likely to be. Even if you have to pay for that advice, it’s something that enables you to take a real view of the situation.”

Ask council

Local council websites are an invaluable tool for finding any issues that may seriously impact the future value or livability of the property you’re considering.

“Look up the street in question and ascertain, for instance, if there’s a DA approval on the houses next door or the one at the back,” says Cunningham. “These things can be easily and quickly checked online. Also check with council about any rezoning plans that may be under consideration. Don’t just rely on the agent to deliver all the information you need. It always pays to do your own research.”

"Don’t panic

It might not be the joyous outcome you envisaged, but all is certainly not lost. Immediately after the auction concludes, expect your agent to make a B line for the highest bidder in an attempt to pinpoint a sale price somewhere between your ideal sum and the potential buyer’s highest bid.

“It then effectively becomes a private treaty negotiation,” says Real Estate Institute of Australia President Malcolm Gunning. “Assuming there were bids placed during the auction, the strategy now will be to try and find a point you’re both happy with and then lock them in within minutes. Failing that, if you can still negotiate a price within 24-hours and sign the contract, auction conditions will still prevail.”
 

No takers?

If the auction attracted no bidders at all, chances are you’ve pitched the price of your property too high. According to Gunning, the smart vendor will now use that market feedback as the barometer for setting a new, more achievable price.

“Have a discussion with your agent and ask why it didn’t sell,” advises Gunning. “In most cases it’ll be because of price. With a good agent, frank discussions around buyer feedback and expectations should have been happening during the lead-up to the auction itself. If your auction attracted no bids, or the bidding stalled, you may then have to adjust your price, using that buyer feedback as the barometer for setting a new number. In effect, you use the auction to benchmark the adjusted price.”
 

Still for sale

Even though an auction may have failed to generate the sale of your property, that doesn’t mean your property is no longer for sale. Far from it.

“The auction day is not the end of the road, but rather a step in the sales process,” says Gunning. “The property is still for sale. Simply go back to the market with an asking price that’s more in line with market expectations. Put it back in the front window of your real estate agent. Go back to a private treaty negotiation. Contact the people who came to inspect the property and update them on the situation. You might then open the house up again the very next week with an asking price. You’ll probably achieve a sale very shortly after.”

"We took a look at the true costs, including the biggest hurdle-a deposit, as well as the impost of stamp duty for first home buyers trying to buy a home for owner occupation.

The first chart highlights the 25th percentile prices for houses and units across each of the capital cities.  The 25th percentile price has been chosen because it reflects prices at the more affordable end of the housing market and is often more representative of the prices at which first home buyers are looking at to enter the market. 

Based on these 25th percentile prices, the cost of stamp duty and transfer fees for houses and units across each of these cities is detailed below.  Keep in mind certain states have stamp duty exemptions which exist below specific price thresholds.  We have assumed that the first home buyer is purchasing at the 25th percentile price for owner occupation.

City x city deposit requirements:

Sydney - $25,733 for houses and $273 for units
Melbourne - $11,553 for houses and $8,507 for units
Brisbane - $1,043 for houses and $845 for units
Adelaide - $16,046 for houses and $12,622 for units
Perth - $422 for houses and $402 for units
Hobart - $9,302 for houses and $7,266 for units
Darwin - $7,557 for houses and $6,337 for units
Canberra - $15,107 for houses and $8,303 for units.

It is a common misconception that in order to purchase a home you need a 20% deposit.  Whilst a 20% deposit is beneficial it is not a necessity however, if you have a deposit of less than 20% most lenders will require you to pay lenders mortgage insurance (LMI).  LMI can be paid up front or capitalised into the loan repayments.  Either way, if a buyer has to pay LMI it will result in higher mortgage repayments or a larger up front deposit.  This analysis has made no provision for LMI costs.

25th percentile prices across the capital cities, April 2017

Costs for 5% deposit and stamp duty on
25th percentile property

Costs for 10% deposit and stamp duty on
25th percentile property

Costs for 15% deposit and stamp duty on
25th percentile property

Costs for 20% deposit and stamp duty on
25th percentile property

Charts two to five highlight the cost of the deposit along with the stamp duty in each capital city for deposits of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%.  Keep in mind that the stamp duty cost is fixed so the cost increases highlighted reflect the greater savings required for a larger deposit. 

When you view the data you can see that saving for a deposit, even a 5% deposit, is a much tougher task in Sydney and Canberra than it is elsewhere in the country.  A 5% deposit on a house in Sydney requires $59,033, in Canberra it requires $41,357 while the deposits required for a house in all other capital cities except for Adelaide ($32,921) is less than half of the deposit required in Sydney. 

The other challenge for potential first home buyers, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne is that household incomes are not growing at the same pace as dwelling values.  Over the 12 months to April 2017, Sydney dwelling values have increased by 16.0% and Melbourne values are 15.3% higher.  At the same time, modelled household income data from the Australian National University (ANU) indicates that over the 12 months to March 2017 Sydney household incomes have increased by a comparatively lower 4.6% and Melbourne household incomes are 2.7% higher.

Entry into the housing market remains a real challenge particularly in our largest and most expensive capital cities.  Even in cheaper areas, household income growth is fairly slow which makes saving a deposit difficult. It is unclear as to how, absent a big fall in property prices, housing affordability for first home buyers can be greatly improved.  Governments have tried incentives such as Grants in the past and they generally just lead to more demand and higher property prices. 

The housing affordability challenge has the potential, over the coming years to create greater social pressures. Younger people may look to move away from the commercial hubs of Sydney and Melbourne because housing costs are too high.  As a result, businesses may find it increasingly difficult to attract young talent unless they offer opportunities in areas where housing is more affordable, both from a purchase and rental perspective.

"Two’s company when you’re house hunting, says CoreLogic CEO Lisa Claes, as new research reveals significant advantages to buying with a partner.

There’s no question that house hunting has become more of an endurance test than an enjoyable way to spend a Saturday morning, with first home-buyers and investors battling it out at auction, and property prices on a continuous upwards trajectory.

But recent CoreLogic research suggests your chances of overcoming the financial hurdles (and emerging with your sanity intact) are far greater if you’re part of a couple.

According to the Perceptions of Housing Affordability report, couples (64%) are around twice as likely to own a property compared to those on their own (33%) with singles getting a raw deal on both a financial and psychological level almost every step of the way.

A financial and psychological advantage

Financially, both first homebuyers and upgraders have been feeling the squeeze in recent years, with almost two-thirds (62%) of Australians believing housing affordability has deteriorated over the past 12 months.

And the evidence supports their theory. Nationally, properties in our capitals have risen by 10.9% in the past year alone, impacting both stamp duty and deposit requirements.

Yet, couples appear to fare better, helped in many cases by a double income making it easier to conquer the initial financial hurdles. Getting a loan is more stressful done solo with 43% of singles stating it was a large impediment compared with 34% of couples. Similarly, meeting repayments is regarded as a large or huge impediment for 42% of singles, but just 33% of couples.

And then there’s the psychological stress to contend with. Singles were more likely than couples to show concern about buying their next home (80% and 74% respectively), and nominate job security as a barrier to affordability (44% of singles compared to 39% of couples).

Buying property is a huge investment and having someone to share the burden at key decision points, empathise with the challenges you’re trying to overcome, and help you navigate the real estate maze, particularly for the first time, can’t be underestimated.

Strength in numbers

With the benefit that coupledom appears to deliver, it’s perhaps no surprise that individuals without a partner may recruit a friend or family member to help them get on the ladder sooner rather than later.

One in five (22%) singles (particularly Millennials) say they would consider it, compared to just over one in ten (13%) of those in a married or de-facto relationship.

If impediments to affordability continue to make it harder for would-be buyers, it’s easy to see how the trend for coupling up – romantically or otherwise – could be an attractive proposition for prospective property owners. Indeed, for many who want to get on the ladder, it could be the only viable option.

"Thinking like a homebuyer when buying your first investment property could save you a lot of cash. Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Propertymarketinsider.com.au explains.

You and I have been told that one of the worst mistakes aspiring investors make is to do it on their own. We’re told that DIY-ing it would lead us overpaying and buying the wrong property.

Having a property expert, advisor or buyer’s agent will prevent this from happening. That’s simply because they have the experience and knowledge that we lack as beginner investors.

Admittedly, I used to believe it too and even preached it when I was the Managing Editor at Your Investment Property. I even used them myself.

But I started my investment journey doing it on my own.

Recently, I started receiving emails from first-time investors asking me how to confidently start investing without paying a hefty $15,000 fee for a buyer’s agent’s service.

They want to know reliable ways to assess a property with good potential. On their own.

So it got me thinking…

Long before buyer’s agents, advisors, coaches and experts became a “necessity” for an aspiring investor, people were doing it by themselves. And quite frankly, they’ve done quite well on average.

So how did they invest way back then?

It’s simple. They invested like a homebuyer.

Think like a homebuyer and save $15,000?

It’s a radical thought. But hear me out.

If you already bought your home and want to buy an investment property next (because your friends and everyone you know are already investing) then you’ve already got the requisite experience.

You’ve been through the whole process. You can use this to your advantage.

So how do you apply this mindset when buying an investment property?

Research as if you’re buying your own home.

As a homebuyer, you’d only buy in areas that you know very well. If you’re not very familiar with the suburb, you’d spend a lot of time scrutinising and learning everything about it.

You don’t just rely on the information you get from the internet or from the agent. You actually go and visit the area. You look at every street and try to figure out what makes it tick. You look for signs that it’s a safe place.

You also check out the people who live there. What are they like? Are people moving in the area? Why? If the opposite is true, you’d find out why.

You look for lifestyle factors. What amenities are available?

Are there good infrastructures such as transport, shops, schools, parks and other amenities that make for a good lifestyle? As a homebuyer, you check that the area has all these and more.

If you apply the same rigour when looking for an investment property, you’re already well ahead.

Inspect the property as if you’re going to live there.

When you attend open homes as a homebuyer, you look for features that would make the place not just liveable but also desirable.

You scrutinise the size of the rooms, the natural lighting and the overall layout and structure of the place.

A lot of investors forget that people want to live in a nice, comfortable home and tend to just focus on the numbers. Then they wonder why their property is always vacant.

That’s why thinking like a homebuyer can be helpful when choosing the right property to buy.

It’s not about whether you want to live there but whether other people like your potential tenants or buyers would want to.

Buy the best property you can afford.

As a homebuyer, you want to buy the best home you can afford. You’re careful not to overextend because you don’t want to lose the family home.

So you strike a balance of picking the best property that you could comfortably support for a long time.

By being able to hold a quality property over the long term, you’re dramatically boosting your chances of making handsome profits when you sell.

Keeping it simple is the key.

As you can see, you don’t need fancy apps and spreadsheets to know you’re buying a good property at a reasonable price.

You just need to get back to basics and remember that people will be living in your property. Know what’s important to them and buy the property that meets that need.

You’ll also be saving yourself a hefty $15,000 in the process.

If however, you feel stuck and need help to move forward, by all means, get a coach or a buyer’s agent.

Just make sure they’re truly independent and reputable.

May your investments be profitable, Always!

"Following the recent election in the US, and the unlikely result, there has been a movement in the US bond markets that has changed the longer term funding outlook for Australian lenders. So much so, that a number of lenders have already increased their fixed interest rates, especially looking out past 3 years. In some cases fixed rates for 5 years went up as much as 60 basis points (or the 0.6 in a 4.6% interest rate). Rates are hard to make sense of so to make this real if you had a $500,000 loan this could mean you are paying $175 more a month and would spend over $19,000 more over a 5 year period.

Fixed rates on mortgages have been at historical lows for the last year, and with a move by a couple of lenders back up we have seen a lot of enquiries about whether to fix and how much.

You can run your own calculation on our highly accurate and flexible refinance calculator and if you need help considering your own situation you can either run highly accurate product searches or chat to our team just about any hour of the day.

Whether to fix?

There are really two reasons you might want to fix your rate:

You are trying to beat the system (i.e. you are trying to pick when rates will bottom out)
You are trying to ensure certainty of at least some if not all of your payments for a reason specific to your situation

We’ll quickly deal with 1.

Trying to beat the banks (in general) in terms of fixing ahead of a movement up in general variable rates is a bit like going to a casino. It feels great if you do ever get it right, but the deck is stacked in their favour. They have better research and insights on their own cost of funding and likely future costs (and their fixed rates reflect this, as we’ll discuss later) and they also control both their variable and fixed rates. If you get it right, it’s great. If not you either lose (pay more than you would have by staying variable) or if you try to refinance early you pay economic costs, basically the difference in interest you would have paid to them.

Fixing to ensure certainty should really be your primary motivation when considering fixing some or all of your mortgage, and as with most things the best option will depend on your situation and what you’re trying to solve for.

There are 3 key factors to consider when looking at fixing your loan

How sensitive you might be to a rate rise (i.e. could you afford it)
How much excess cashflow you have which you could use to pay down your mortgage faster
The difference between variable and fixed rates

 

Sensitivity to rate rises

In the previous decades we have seen mortgage rates well north of 7% so an exercise every person with a mortgage (or considering one) should do is think, “How much would my repayments be if rates went up by 1 or 2% – and how would my lifestyle be impacted?”. The impact could be as ‘little’ as less savings through to cutting out on major spend to major impact on lifestyle through to financial hardship.  When lenders (and advisers like uno) look at your ability to afford the mortgage they tend to use a minimum servicing rate of 7.5% to determine borrowing power. Basically they assume the rate of the loan they are making to you is going to be 7.5% even if it’s not. In theory this means you should be able to afford a rate increase back up to those levels but the reality is we get used to a certain lifestyle based on a certain income that has commitments (such as loan repayments or other expenses) and if those change, making changes elsewhere can be tough.

In short, if through looking at your finances (income, spending, debt, desire to save) you can see that an increase in rates is going to have a big impact on your lifestyle then considering fixing is a worthwhile exercise. We’re yet to build a ‘should I fix’ calculator for customers but our experts can run these calculations for you free of charge and talk about your options whether your purchasing or refinancing.

"A NEW video analysis of historical house price data has revealed just how high Sydney’s property prices have soared in the last 35 years, pinpointing the suburbs that have seen the most median value growth since 1980.

The Onthehouse.com.au research revealed that eastern suburb Bellevue Hill was the most expensive postcode region back in 1980 and that it has come full-circle to reclaim that title today, however the difference in value is staggering.

The median house value in Bellevue Hill was just over $200,000 in 1980. Today, the median value is $4.2 million.

The data also revealed that the Sydney CBD was the first postcode region to reach the million dollar mark, which occured in 1989. However, the median value dropped to $980,000 one year later and then fell dramatically in the year 2000 to $800,000.

In 2000, Darling Point - which includes the suburb of Point Piper – became the most expensive postcode region with a median value of $1.6 million. A decade later, Darling Point houses had more than doubled in value and was once again named the most expensive postcode region with a median value of $3.6 million.

Onthehouse.com.au Market Analys Eliza Owen said that the north shore suburbs of Gordon and Killara have led each historical upswing, while suburbs west of the CBD tended to lag behind.

Ms Owen commented “You can see from 1980 to today that there is now a significantly higher range of values across Sydney. What may come as the biggest surprise to people looking back at the last 35 years is the reoccurring trend of the inner west areas being the last regions near the city to pick up in value. This is partly due to being under the flight path, because you have the airport just to the south of the inner west, and historically it is a low socio-economic area relative to the north shore and eastern suburbs.”

By 2011, most of North Sydney, the eastern suburbs and the north shore were worth well over $1 million. The median values in these areas contrasted starkly against so many other regions, particularly in the south west where house values were still under $400,000. It wasn’t until Australia’s largest housing boom in 2013 that Southwest Sydney almost doubled in value.

“You can see that since 2011, south west Sydney nearly doubles in value as a result of spill-over from the inner west, and spill-over from Badgerys Creek on the other side of Sydney,” Ms Owen commented.

Ms Owen continued: “On this note, it is interesting to see Badgerys Creek as another separate growth centre, which is seeing higher values in surrounding postcodes as well. The reason for the higher values can most likely be put down to properties sitting on acreage or really large plots of under-developed land.”

"With recent record high levels of new housing construction and investor mortgage activity, the supply of housing stock available for rent is climbing and is expected to continue to increase.

Australia has a growing population and the people moving to Australia need to be housed somewhere.  Over recent years the uplift in population growth has not been met with a commensurate rise in property sales.  Rental advertisement counts suggest that the population growth is increasingly being housed via investment housing (rental accommodation) which aligns with the lift in investor housing finance commitments over recent years.

Over the 12 months to January 2017, there were 362,708 houses advertised for rent and 287,233 units advertised for rent nationally.  The number of rental advertisements over the past year was 8.7% higher for houses and 9.3% higher for units.  The rental market is currently seeing historic low rates of rental growth and with the amount of rental accommodation ramping up it is easy to see why.  Keep in mind this data is only those properties advertised for rent and not every rental property will be advertised for rent each year.

Annual number of residential properties
listed for rent, National

The two tables within this report highlight the council areas that have seen the greatest increases and decreases in rental advertisements over the past year.  Note that we have only included council areas that have had at least 1,000 rental advertisements over the 12 months to January 2017.

Council areas with the largest rise in rental
advertisement, 12 months to Jan-17

Western Australia council areas feature heavily on the list of regions that have seen the greatest increase in rental advertisements over the year, many of which are located in Perth.  Investor activity has been sluggish in WA so this may indicate that as the economy has weakened and people have migrated away from WA, perhaps home owners are looking to rent out their home rather than selling into weak market conditions.  A number of NSW regions are also featured on the list and this is probably more reflective of the ramping-up of housing supply purchased by investors.

Of those regions with at least 1,000 rental advertisements over the past year, only 17 council areas have actually seen a decline in rental advertisements over the year.  Two of the improving housing markets for value growth, Canberra and Hobart, are amongst these 17 council areas.  The areas with less rental stock advertised than a year ago also tend to be more slanted towards regional areas rather than capital cities.  This is not surprising given that housing supply has largely been increasing in capital cities rather than regional markets.  Despite the housing construction boom in Sydney at the moment, Kogarah, Warringah and Manly have recorded fewer properties advertised this year compared to last year, signaling tighter rental conditions.

Council areas with the largest decline in
rental advertisements, 12 months to Jan-17

With a record high number of new dwellings still under construction, most of which are units and many of which have been purchased by investors, it is anticipated that the number of properties advertised for rent will continue to rise.  The impact of this is that rental growth is likely to remain dampened and those in the rental market in most regions will have an increasing number of properties to choose from.  For owners of investment properties and property managers should be mindful of their local rental conditions, and set their weekly rents accordingly to maximize their occupancy as well as income.  Landlords in areas where the supply of rental properties has shown a rise may find they need to hold their rents steady or in fact, provide a discount on their rental expectations in order to keep or attract tenants.

"The Reserve Bank (RBA) Governor Phil Lowe suggested last week that if it wasn’t for the strength of the housing market, and a fear of inflating it further, official interest rates would be lower.  It was an interesting comment from an RBA Governor, especially when you read what the RBA’s function is: The (RBA) is Australia's central bank and derives its functions and powers from the Reserve Bank Act 1959. Its duty is to contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people. It does this by setting the cash rate to meet an agreed medium-term inflation target, working to maintain a strong financial system and efficient payments system, and issuing the nation's banknotes.

Inflation is currently well below the RBAs target range and the country is not at full-employment which would indicate the RBA should be considering interest rate cuts.  Clearly the economic prosperity and welfare of Australian people (linked to dwelling value growth) is a key reason why they are not cutting interest rates.

When you look at some of the key data, it seems like it could still be a long time before the RBA starts lifting interest rates again.

Official interest rates

The RBA has a target range for underlying inflation of between 2% to 3% over the medium term.  The main mechanism to increase inflation is by cutting interest rates; at the moment the annual rate of headline inflation is 1.5% while underlying inflation is 1.6%, both of which are below the target range.  In fact, annual underlying inflation has grown at a rate below 2% for each of the past four quarters with inflation having not been that consistently weak since the RBA implemented its inflation targeting policy in the early 1990’s.  Under normal circumstances the RBA would likely be cutting official interest rates in an effort to stimulate consumption and push consumer prices higher, however, concerns of further inflating Sydney and Melbourne home values is likely a significant barrier to making this move.

Annual change in headline and underlying
inflation over time

At the same time the economy is experiencing low inflation, weekly wages are increasing at their slowest annual pace on record.  Over the 12 months to December 2016 the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) wage price index has increased by 1.9%.  The Index has been published since September 1997 and this is the lowest annual increase on record.  With wage increases sluggish at best, the prospects of consumer spending picking up and lifting inflation remain muted.

Annual change in wage price index

At a time with record low interest rates, wage growth and low inflation the Australian economy is also experiencing record high levels of household debt.  At the end of the September 2016 quarter, the ratio of household debt to disposable income was a record-high 186.9% while the ratio of housing debt to disposable income was also at a record-high 132.2%.  The high level of household debt certainly goes some way to explaining why households are spending less (outside of housing in Sydney and Melbourne).  It should also be noted that the ratios of household (885.7%) and housing (481.1%) assets to disposable income are currently also at record highs.  This indicates that although debt is extremely high, the value of the assets that debt is held against is also high. Keep in mind, these assets are largely housing assets which are not liquid so utilising the value of the assets is more difficult than if it was available as cash or in more liquid assets such as shares.

When you combine all of these factors it becomes clear firstly that were it not for the strength in growth in dwelling values in Sydney and Melbourne, official interest rates could be even lower than their current record lows.  The RBA has already stated that their forecast is for headline inflation to be back within their target range late this year with underlying inflation taking longer to reach the target range.  The trend in wages growth remains subdued, meanwhile household debt is still rising.  Based on these factors, it is likely to be some time before the RBA is in a position to raise interest rates and with household debt at historic highs we would expect the eventual increases to be slow and unlikely to result in interest rates returning to historic average levels.

"A final walk-through isn’t just about making sure that all inclusions are in their rightful place, it’s also a chance to scope out any unwanted or undesirable items that may have been left behind.

Taking attendance

If you’re buying a place to simply knock down then a final visit to account for all the light fittings is pretty pointless. However, if you’ve purchased a high-spec home or indeed any place you’re planning to live in or rent out, a first-hand inspection is a must. In a nutshell, you’re looking to ensure that all the items mentioned as inclusions in the sale contract are all present and accounted for.

“Any prudent buyer should do a final walk-through,” says Real Estate Institute of Australia President Malcolm Gunning. “That’s because it’s not uncommon for people take things like light fittings, stoves, or mirrors. Maybe they took them for sentimental reasons, or maybe they didn’t understand fully what was in the contract. Regardless, just before settlement you should be walking through to make sure all items on the list of inclusions are there. I would think that an hour is sufficient for the task.”

 

Put the brakes on

If you do find any items to be missing, the vendor is technically in breach of contract. That means only one thing: don’t settle.

“Don’t quietly accept it - simply ring your lawyer and inform him of the situation,” explains Gunning. “He’ll then call the other side and relay your concerns. Missing items can either be replaced or a price of a replacement agreed upon, with that amount subtracted from the purchase price. Taking this action might only delay settlement proceedings a few hours.”

With all contractual objections or queries, however, sanity still needs to prevail.

“You can’t be overly pedantic,” says Gunning. “The experienced real estate agent can also step in at this time and advise whether what you’re asking for is reasonable or unreasonable. It’s also their role to step in and help broker a solution.”

 

Unwanted extras

A final walk-through isn’t just about making sure that all inclusions are in their rightful place. It’s also a chance to scope out any unwanted or undesirable items that may have been left behind. Whether it’s a pile of heavy paving stones down the side or a garage that’s still chock-full of rubbish, now’s your one and only chance to get the situation rectified in your favour.

“In such instances you can also ask them to fix the problem or again ask for a price reduction to cover the cost of removal,” says Gunning. “Remember, you’re well within your rights to stop the settlement and request that the situation be resolved.”

 

Dirty deeds

You’re also entitled to make sure that the place has been left in a clean and presentable condition. If it’s a mess, it’s the vendor’s responsibility to either clean it fast or compensate you financially.

“You should always expect a place to be neat and tidy,” says Gunning. “If the vendor has left the oven in a dirty, greasy condition, or the place itself in an absolutely filthy state, you would also be requesting some money off the sales price in order to get the place cleaned.”

"Market Update

Before we dive into this month’s housing market update, it’s worthwhile reminding our readers about the two different ways Residex measures price changes across the housing market.

Residex has historically produced two measures of price / value growth across the Australian housing market: the non-revisionary median value index (summary results have typically been published monthly on the Residex blog) and the revisionary repeat sales index (updated quarterly with a revised back series and generally relied upon by policy makers as the preferred Residex measure).

The non-revising median value method uses an indexing technique to estimate the current median value of all houses and units using all properties which have transacted in the region. Alternatively, the repeat sales index identifies sale pairs and calculates the capital gain across these sales.

Both measures provide a valid measurement of housing market conditions, while they also have their drawbacks.

The non-revising median value index provides an estimate of capital gain or decline across the entire property portfolio, regardless of whether a dwelling has transacted over the most recent period. It is useful for assessing the broad change in the overall value of housing stock from period to period, but will not revise historically as new data flows through.

The repeat sales method excludes transactions without a sales pair which inherently excludes the effect of new housing stock and also excludes those properties which may have transacted prior to digital records being kept. A repeat sales index is ideal for understanding the capital gain or loss between sales over time, regardless of their hold period.

Neither method has been adjusted or changed in any way since CoreLogic acquired Residex, however with policy makers utilising and referring to Residex’s repeat sales index, it makes sense that we include the quarterly repeat sales index for public commentary and market analysis.

Observing some of the comments from the market in reference to Residex indices, it seems there has been confusion between the two measures, with some commentators confusing the non-revisionary median value measure with the repeat sales measure.

Of course both measures are still available on a subscription basis, with detailed segmentation across small geographic regions and across housing types. Both of the Residex indices have particular strengths and purposes, and interpretation depends on the use case.

This month we are focussing on the Residex non-revising median value series which is current to the end of January.

Based on the Residex results, national house values were 4.9% higher over the past 12 months while national unit values were 2.7% higher. The annual result is down slightly compared with the same period a year ago, when the Residex median house value rose by 5.8%, and units 5.5%.

Table 1: Residex Median Value Statistical Summary- January Data

The regional variation in housing market performance has been significant. Over the past 12 months, Residex data shows the regional areas of Victoria (+9.0%) and New South Wales (+8.7) recorded the largest gain in median house values, while across the capital cities the strongest gains were in Hobart (+7.8%) and Melbourne (+5.9%). At the other end of the spectrum were the markets where house values had fallen over the past 12 months. Residex reported a fall in the median value of houses across Darwin (-6.7%), regional NT (-5.7%), Perth (-3.6%) and regional WA (-3.6%).

The unit sector reported growth in median unit values that has generally been lower than growth in median house values. Interestingly, in Brisbane, where concerns around oversupply have plagued the market, annual growth in the median unit value (+1.2%) was higher than growth in the median house value (+0.6%).

Different methods, different outcomes

The latest median value results from Residex highlight one of the more confusing aspects of analysing and understanding housing markets. As a case in point, while the Residex median value series is reporting that Sydney house values rose in value by 4.6% over the past twelve months, the same data set, but using a repeat sales index shows an annual growth rate of 7.1%. Other measures from Residex parent company, CoreLogic, shows Sydney house values were up 16.0% based on the hedonic regression method, were 12.9% higher using a stratified median and 10.2% higher based on the more volatile simple median measure.

The chart below traces the rolling annual change in house prices/values since 2009 using each of these measures. Outside of the simple median price, which shows a substantially higher amount of volatility, the other measures tend to show broadly similar outcomes over the medium to long term.

Importantly, three of the five measures outlined below have a revising back series (simple median, repeat sales and stratified median) which means the more recent trends for these series will be adjusted as more data flows through. This is one factor that can help to explain the tight correlation historically, as well as recent divergence.

It is also important to note that the CoreLogic hedonic regression index is not revised. It is also published in a high frequency format (daily) and only one day in arrears, so it is very timely. In Mid-2016 the CoreLogic hedonic index was the first series to show a rebound in the slowing pace of capital gains, which also coincided with the May and August rate cuts as well as a resurgence in investor participation in the housing market.

Progressively over the second half of 2016, each of the alternative measures have followed this rebounding trend to different extents. It is now very clear across a wide range of measures that lower interest rates and the increased demand from investors triggered a rebound in housing market growth that has once again been very much concentrated within the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets. Smaller cities such as Canberra and Hobart also saw value increases, appealing for their relative affordability.

Unfortunately, improvements made to the CoreLogic hedonic index sampling technique in May last year distracted many commentators from reporting the turnaround in housing market conditions that were identified very early by the CoreLogic hedonic regression series; a trend which has now been confirmed by the Residex median value and repeat sales series as well as other published measures.

Other factors in the market are also supporting continued strength in the housing market. Listing numbers remain historically low across the most active housing markets, clearance rates are tracking in the high-70% to mid-80% range and average selling time has reduced over the second half of the year. Additionally, transaction numbers ceased a downward trend over the second half of 2016 and started to rise.

The different methods used to measure housing market conditions will always show variations. This is inherent due to different calculation methods, but also the revising nature of some indices and the underlying differences in raw data. Over the longer term, the housing market trends track very closely across each of the quoted methodologies, however some will show the twists and turns of the housing market in a much timelier manner.

"New South Wales and Victoria now account for a historically high proportion of national mortgage demand which continues to drive dwelling values much higher across these two cities compared with other regions.

The current housing market growth phase has really been all about Sydney and Melbourne. When you look at dwelling value growth, increases have been substantially higher in Sydney and Melbourne than in all other capital cities. At the same time, demand for mortgages has surged across NSW and Vic (both of which are proxies for Sydney and Melbourne) while it has barely increased across the remaining states and territories.

The first chart highlights the change in capital city dwelling values over the current growth phase. The growth phase broadly began in June 2012 and over the period, only Sydney and Melbourne have recorded value rises greater than 21%. The rise in values has been supported by low interest rates and availability of mortgage finance however, other factors such as localised economic performance, population growth and foreign demand have driven the much stronger growth in Sydney and Melbourne than across the other capital cities.

Change in capital city home values
over current growth phase

Looking at mortgage finance across the states and territories, in December 2016 the value of mortgage lending across each state and territory was recorded at: $14.5 billion in NSW, $9.6 billion in Vic, $5.1 billion in Qld, $1.6 billion in SA, $2.7 billion in WA, $0.3 billion in Tas, $0.2 billion in NT and $0.7 billion in ACT. Over the month, NSW (41.8%) and Vic (27.7%) accounted for a combined 69.5% of the value of all housing finance commitments which was an historic high. In June 2012 when the current growth phase commenced, 33.6% of housing finance commitments were in NSW and 27.1% were in Vic.

Value of monthly mortgage lending
by states and territories

The value of housing finance commitments for owner occupier housing in December 2016 across the states and territories were recorded at: $7.7 billion in NSW, $6.0 billion in Vic, $3.5 billion in Qld, $1.1 billion in SA, $2.0 billion in WA, $0.3 billion in Tas, $0.1 billion NT and $0.4 billion in ACT. Since the current value growth phase commenced in June 2012, monthly mortgage lending to owner occupiers has increased from $4.3 billion in NSW and $3.9 billion in Vic.

Value of monthly owner occupier mortgage lending
by states and territories

In December 2016, the value of mortgage lending to investors across the states and territories was recorded at: $6.8 billion in NSW, $3.7 billion in Vic, $1.7 billion in Qld, $0.5 billion in SA, $0.7 billion in WA, $0.1 billion in Tas, $0.1 billion in NT and $0.2 billion in ACT. More than three quarters (76.3%) of investor mortgage finance nationally in December 2016 was in NSW (49.6%) or Vic (26.7%). While the proportion of lending to investors has previously been higher in each state, combined they make up the largest share on record. At the beginning of the current growth phase, 37.3% of national investor finance commitments were in NSW and 25.1% was in NSW.

Value of monthly investor mortgage lending
by states and territories

The data shows just how concentrated mortgage demand nationally is currently in NSW and Vic. With the demand focused so much on those two states, it’s no wonder values in Sydney and Melbourne have increased so much more than in the other capital cities. While steps have been made to cool mortgage demand, particularly from investors in Sydney and Melbourne, the data points to the fact that demand remains unquestionably strong. With interest rates remaining at close to historic lows, it is clear that further changes will be required in order to slow mortgage demand and dampen the increases in dwelling values being experienced in Sydney and Melbourne.

"As the saying goes, some things are worth paying for. And unless you have extensive experience in the area of selling property, enlisting the services of a real estate agent is one of them.

Nila Sweeney, managing editor with Property Market Insider spoke with property lecturer and author Peter Koulizos on how to pick the right agent to sell your home.

How to find the best real estate agent to sell your property?
1. Look locally

Look within the local area because a sound understanding of the local market is essential to selling a property. It allows insight into timing, pricing and even marketing techniques.

Don’t compromise local knowledge for a more well-known agent or even one recommended by a friend, if they are located on the other side of the city.

While they may have been a fantastic choice for your friend, agents that specialise in the eastern suburbs market won’t have as much knowledge and expertise as an agent who is based in the southern or western areas for example.

2. Word of mouth

Word of mouth in the local area can be a great first step to finding a real estate sales agent.

If that doesn’t prove helpful or if you want to make sure you get the best agent, do a Google search of agents in the area and start making a list.

3. Check the real estate agent’s sales record

Look at the sales records of the agents in your area. Certainly take note of their listings but also dig deeper into their sales history.

While it’s a good sign to have a number of properties listed, be sure to check that the agent can actually sell them.

4. Look at how fast the agent sells a property

Do some further research and see if any patterns arise in regard to the number of days the property was on the market and the agent’s clearance rates. Compare the advertised price guide to the actual sale price and see if particular agents seem to keep falling short of the advertised price.

It’s also important to differentiate between agency sales and individual salesperson/agent sales.

5. Attend open inspections

Once you have a few potential real estate agents in mind, go to some of their open inspections. This allows you to be a mystery shopper of sorts and observe their selling techniques and also meet them in a more relaxed context.

Take note of how they welcome people and talk to them.

Are they polite and helpful or detached and indifferent? This is important because it will be the first impression a potential buyer gets of the house.

6. Ask questions about the property

Take it one step further and ask some questions about the property because that will give you an idea of how much the agent has bothered to learn about the house.

Keep an ear out for remarks they make to yourself and other inspectors and ensure they’re acting in the best interests of the vendor, as that may end up being you.

7. Short-list the potential agents

Once you have short-listed a handful of agents, call them. A few won’t call back which will straight away narrow the list further and you may decide over the phone that a few aren’t quite what you are looking for.

8. Be clear about how you want your real estate agent to run the show

Before you make the calls, determine what kind of client you want to be and relay that to the agent to see if they’re able to work with your request.

For example, if you want to be kept updated at every step along the way, let them know that. On the other hand, you may wish to have as little to do with the selling process as possible and don’t need the agent to run you past all the details.  

9. Request an appraisal

Of the remaining potential agents, request an appraisal. An appraisal is an estimated selling price for the property and should be free of charge.

The results may vary so make sure the agent can justify their figure. Some may come back with a higher price but this doesn’t necessarily make them the best agent because the price they’ve set may be unattainable and it sets you up with unrealistic expectations.

10. Ask the real estate agent about their strategy on getting the best price for your property

Don’t be afraid to ask them questions about their selling technique. Will they auction the property or sell it by private treaty? Will there be expressions of interest? How often will they conduct open inspections?

11. Negotiate commissions

You can certainly haggle but be wary that a lower commission should not be your main selection criteria. Remember the old saying, “If you pay peanuts, you’ll get monkeys”.

12. Trust your instinct

Finally, don’t ignore your gut feeling. If you have a particularly good or bad feeling about an agent, don’t discard that because it can come in handy in conjunction with other selection criteria when making your final decision. 

Selling property can be hard work and it is complicated. Unless you are familiar with real estate and the sales process, you should consider finding the right agent to sell your property.

"A retrospective look at median dwelling values across the suburbs of Australia shows the bracket creep that has occurred over the current growth cycle, highlighting the deterioration of more affordable housing across the capital cities over the past five years.

At the end of 2016, 7.6% of suburbs nationally had a median house value under $200,000 and 5.9% of suburbs had a median unit value below $200,000.  To put these figures into some perspective, 11.4% of suburbs had a median house value of at least $1 million and 3.0% of suburbs had a median unit value of at least $1 million.

Over the five years to the end of 2016, there has been a substantial decline in the proportion of suburbs with a median value below $400,000.  At the end of 2011, 53.5% of suburbs had a median house value of less than $400,000 and 69.8% of suburbs had a median unit value of less than $400,000.  By the end of 2016, the proportion of suburbs with a median value of less than $400,000 had fallen to 41.0% for houses and 55.3% for units.

Suburb median values by value range,
National, December of each year

A five year retrospective look at the individual capital cities highlights the significant shift in the proportion of suburbs with a median value under $400,000, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.

In 2011, the proportion of total suburbs with a median house value below $400,000 across each capital city was: 21.2% in Sydney, 28.9% in Melbourne, 40.9% in Brisbane, 40.5% in Adelaide, 31.1% in Perth, 69.2% in Hobart, 2.1% in Darwin and 1.1% in Canberra.  Units offer a more affordable option highlighted by the proportions of suburbs values below $400,000 at: 38.8% in Sydney, 48.2% in Melbourne, 81.7% in Brisbane, 94.3% in Adelaide, 59.8% in Perth, 92.7% in Hobart, 53.3% in Darwin and 44.6% in Canberra.

Capital cities, December 2011

By 2015, the proportion of suburbs with a median house value below $400,000 had shifted to: 1.2% in Sydney, 12.2% for Melbourne, 31.4% in Brisbane, 29.5% in Adelaide, 15.5% in Perth, 55.7% in Hobart and 0.0% in both Darwin and Canberra.  For units, the proportion of suburbs with a median value of less than $400,000 in December 2015 were recorded at: 10.9% in Sydney, 34.9% in Melbourne, 64.4% in Brisbane, 87.7% in Adelaide, 37.2% in Perth, 88.4% in Hobart, 51.4% in Darwin and 50.5% in Canberra.

Suburb median values by value range,
Capital cities, December 2015

The proportion of suburbs with a median house value of less than $400,000 at the end of 2016 was recorded at: 0.1% in Sydney, 6.3% in Melbourne, 29.2% in Brisbane, 28.0% in Adelaide, 18.9% in Perth, 52.1% in Hobart and 0.0% in Darwin and Canberra.  For units the proportions were recorded at: 6.5% in Sydney, 31.8% in Melbourne, 62.7% in Brisbane, 85.1% in Adelaide, 46.4% in Perth, 88.4% in Hobart, 57.6% in Darwin and 45.8% in Canberra.

Suburb median values by value range,
Capital cities, December 2016

Five years ago every capital city except for Darwin and Canberra had at least 20% of suburbs with a median house value of less than $400,000.  At the end of last year, it was virtually impossible to find houses for less than $400,000 in Sydney, Darwin and Canberra while less than 7% of suburbs had a median house value below $400,000 in Melbourne.  Across each city there has been a substantial decline in more affordable housing over the past year despite the fact that outside of Sydney and Melbourne there has been only moderate value growth over the period.

Even units have recorded a fairly substantial decline in the proportion of suburbs with a median value of less than $400,000 over the past five years. 

At the end of 2016, looking at both houses and units, 20.5% of Sydney suburbs had a median value of less than $600,000 compared to 38.5% of suburbs having a median value of at least $1 million.  To further highlight deteriorating housing affordability in Sydney, 34.6% of suburbs had a median unit value of less than $600,000 at the end of 2016.  In each other capital city, a higher proportion of suburbs had a median house value of less than $600,000 than the proportion of suburbs with a median unit value of less than $600,000.

If you are earning a relatively low income in Sydney and are looking to buy a house or unit, you are competing for a rapidly declining pool of housing stock across the city.  The pool is also declining across the remaining capitals, albeit not at the same pace of decline as in Sydney.

"No doubt, one of the key topics of conversation at this month’s RBA board meeting was around housing market conditions and the ongoing rebound in the rate of capital gains over the second half of 2016 and first two months of 2017.

The CoreLogic monthly hedonic index shows capital city dwelling values have increased by 7.8% since the May ‘16 rate cut. The renewed exuberance in the housing market over the past eight months is due to more than just low mortgage rates. The reacceleration in capital gains also coincides with a substantial rebound in investment purchasing activity which has been a key driver of market demand and upwards price pressures.

The predicament for the RBA is clear, they are unwilling to drop rates because this would likely add further fuel to the housing market; they don’t want to push rates higher as this will stifle consumption and investment more broadly as well as potentially place some upwards pressure on the Australian dollar.

While interest rates remain at their current low level, and in the absence of additional macro prudential measures, we should expect housing demand from investors and owner occupiers to remain strong, particularly in those cities where economic conditions remain strong and migration rates remain high.

"The average days on market figure provides valuable insight into the performance of the housing market.  The figure measures the average difference between the date at which a property is listed for sale and the day at which it goes under contract.  The figure is only calculated across those properties that sold by private treaty, excluding tenders and auction sales.  When homes are selling quicker it points to stronger buyer demand and vice versa.

Across the combined capital cities, it took an average of 38 days to sell a home in December 2016.  This figure was lower than the 41 days a year earlier and is down from high throughout 2016 of 50 days in August 2016.  Four of the eight capital cities now have an average days on market figure below 40 days while most of the other capital cities are now seeing the days on market figure starting to trend lower.

Days on market, Combined capital cities

The typical Sydney dwelling sold after an average of 33 days in December 2016 compared to 39 days in December 2015.

Melbourne dwellings took an average of 35 days to sell in December 2015 with the figure falling to an historic low of 29 days at the end of 2016. 

Dwellings were taking an average of 57 days to sell at the end of 2016 in Brisbane compared to 43 days a year earlier.  Brisbane is only city in which the days on market figure has trended higher.

Adelaide dwellings were taking 43 days to sell at the end of last year, which is as long as they were taking a year earlier however, the days on market figure has fallen over recent months.

The typical Perth dwelling was taking 65 days to sell at the end of 2016 compared to 58 days at the end of 2015 however, the days on market figure has reduced over the past few months.

Hobart has recorded a large fall in the days on market figure over the past year, reducing from 47 days in December 2015 to 35 days in December 2016.

Dwellings in Darwin were taking an average of 86 days to sell at the end of 2016, up from 74 days at the end of 2015 however, over recent months the figure has begun to fall.

At the end of 2015, the typical Canberra dwelling was taking 47 days to sell compared to 37 days at the end of 2016.

The days on market figures will be important to follow throughout 2017.  After the current growth phase has run for more than four and a half years, we are still seeing a rapid rate of sale in Sydney and Melbourne.  Low levels of stock available for sale and many willing purchases continue to drive a rapid rate of sale in Sydney and Melbourne while the rate of sale is improving in most other capital cities. 

The days on market figure will provide a good indication of the strength of individual housing markets throughout 2017.  Keep in mind that the next two months of data (January and February) will show the regular seasonal spike but thereafter the data will be much more representative of the housing market’s performance across each capital city.",2021_04_23,4-May-17,N/A,Melbourne Vendors in the Driver’s Seat as Properties Sell the Fastest of any Capital City
"Research is the lifeblood of a profitable property investment. Do it right and you’ll avoid buying a lemon. Do it wrong and you’ll end up losing a lot of money.

So what are these fatal research mistakes to avoid? Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Property Market Insider explains.

1. Taking research shortcuts

Cutting corners with your research just to trump other buyers is likely to land you in serious trouble. This is especially tempting when buying in hot markets where irrational buyers are competing fiercely over properties.

Don’t forgo your research no matter how good a property looks on paper. You still need to establish whether this property is a good deal or a dud.

The only way for you to find out is doing a comprehensive research and analysis. Without it, you could end up buying an underperforming investment or worst, a money-losing property.

You need to investigate what’s behind the statistics and apply your common sense.

At a time when a lot of information is available at your fingertips, you can’t afford to do too little research especially when such a huge investment is at stake.

2. Doing too much research

While not doing enough research is a risky move, doing too much research and getting bogged down with too much information is equally as bad.

This often leads to over-analysis and confusion, also known as analysis paralysis. Many newbie investors especially those who are overly risk-averse often suffer from over-analysis.

The best way to avoid this is to have a comprehensive buying criteria and focus on ticking them off.

If a property meets your buying brief and you’re financially ready, then you should be able to confidently move forward.

Having a structured research will not only save you time but also ensures that you’re focusing on the indicators that truly matters.

3. Trusting the statistics too much

Even if you think the source of information is reputable, you still need to verify these facts independently.

Property data and information can be skewed through misreporting or under-reporting. It’s your job to ensure they’re reliable.

Relying on the stats alone to make your investment decision is risky without verifying and comparing it with other available data.

You need to examine as many data as possible to see that they’re all showing a similar trend.

4.Skipping research altogether

Researching the market can be daunting. There are a lot of concepts you need to learn in a hurry. But this is not a reason to avoid it.

Investing without doing your due diligence is akin to investing blind. You’re buying something that costs you a lot of money and hoping that it will grow in value somehow.

There’s simply no substitute for research. You must do it if you want to succeed as an investor.

"There was a time in which having a dwelling worth $1 million or more meant that the property was exclusive and rare.  Today dwellings with a $1 million valuation are becoming much more common.  At the end of 2016, there were 760 suburbs nationally that had a median value of at least $1 million.  This figure has increased from just 275 suburbs nationally five years earlier. Units have been the big mover with the number of $1 million suburbs increasing by 479% over the five years compared to a 160% increase for houses.

87% of the suburbs nationally that had a median value of at least $1 million were located in either New South Wales (70.3%) or Victoria (16.7%) up from 75.6% in New South Wales (60.4%) and Victoria (15.3%) five years earlier.

The combined capital cities accounted for 93.5% of all the $1 million suburbs in 2011 and this increased marginally to 93.6% in 2016.  This is representative of the higher cost of housing in capital city markets.  It also highlights the relatively weaker value growth performance of regional housing markets throughout recent years.

Escalating dwelling values in Sydney, and to a lesser degree Melbourne, have resulted in an increasing proportion of the suburbs with a median value of at least $1 million over the past five years.  At the end of 2011, 57.8% of the suburbs nationally with a median value of at least $1 million were in Sydney, by the end of 2016 the proportion had risen to 65.4% of suburbs nationally.  The proportion of $1 million suburbs in Melbourne has increased to 16.4% of suburbs nationally at the end of 2016 from 15.3% at the end of 2011. 

Further highlighting the rapid increase in values over recent years is the data for suburbs with a median value of at least $2 million.  At the end of 2011, 39 suburbs nationally had a median value of at least $2 million.  By the end of 2016, this figure had risen to 136 suburbs nationally, an increase of 249% over five years.  At the end of 2011, 30 of the 39 suburbs were located in Sydney and by the end of 2016, 115 of the 136 suburbs were located in Sydney.

While rising housing values increase the asset wealth of owners, it is also reflective of the fact that for those who don’t yet own a home it is becoming increasingly difficult to save a large enough deposit in order to purchase a home.  This is particularly the case in Sydney and Melbourne where over the past five years, dwelling values have increased by a total of 68.1% and 43.3% respectively.  Meanwhile, wages are increasing at their slowest pace on record and housing affordability is once again a central them in the political debate.  The rise in suburbs with a median value of at least $1 million over recent years is reflective of the growing chasm between those that own homes and those who don’t.

"Market Update

Residex repeat sales index shows an acceleration in housing market performance across most capital cities over the second half of 2016. Residex recently released the results of their repeat sales index for the December quarter of 2016. The quarterly results showed house and unit prices, based on resold properties, increased across every capital city and housing type with the exception of Perth, where house and unit prices fell, and the Brisbane market, where unit prices were lower.

Table 1: Residex Repeat Sales Statistical Summary - December Data

Source: Residex

The Residex repeat sales index provides a unique perspective on the housing market, considering the resales methodology is very different to other housing market measurements available in the marketplace, which are typically price based (simple median prices and stratified median prices) or quality adjusted value based measures (hedonic regression index). In simple terms, the Residex repeat sales method examines sale pairs (ie where a property has sold at least twice, the most recent sale price is compared with the previous sale price to measure the extent of capital gain or loss). Inherently, a resale method of measuring housing market conditions excludes the effect of newly developed properties because they don’t have a previous sale price to compare with. The methodology also excludes those properties that have seen a change in their attributes over time, which controls for the effects of obvious capital works on the property. Based on the December quarter data, property transactions with a sales pair accounted for approximately 70% of all house sales across the capital cities and 63% of all unit sales. The remaining transactions were either properties that sold for the first time over the quarter (ie new to market) or there were changes to the property attributes such as additional bedrooms or bathrooms or a change to the land area.

Importantly, the Residex repeat sales index is revisionary. As more data flows through, more sale pairs are identified which may result in some upwards and downwards revisions to the indices. The latest release of the Residex Repeat Sales index provides a timely update to housing market trends based on resales, and also relative to the widely followed CoreLogic hedonic index. During 2016 the CoreLogic hedonic index showed some divergence from the Residex repeat sales indices, as well other median priced based measures, with CoreLogic growth trends showing some acceleration over the second half of the year. Part of the divergence can be explained by the different methodologies, and also the high frequency of the hedonic index reporting (a daily index with monthly updates compared with less frequent quarterly readings from other indices). Additionally, the unprecedented level of new dwelling construction likely affects housing market readings and adds to volatility. There hasn’t been a time in the past when the mix of housing stock has changed so quickly and dramatically. The repeat sales method will inherently overlook the effect of new housing, while long settlement periods for off the plan sales, which now comprise a larger proportion of sales, will influence median price measures well after the reporting period has passed. Other factors affecting divergence can be found based on differences in reporting geographies, differences in the underlying data sets and sampling techniques and weightings applied to housing stock. According to the Residex repeat sales index, Sydney house prices were 3.1% higher over the December quarter to be 7.1% higher over the calendar year. While price growth based on resales remains substantially lower than a year ago, the September and December quarter readings were approximately twice as high as the March quarter, highlighting a substantial bounce in capital gains across the Sydney market. The acceleration in market conditions can also be seen across the Sydney unit market with the repeat sales index increasing by 2.3% over the December quarter to be 7.4% higher over the calendar year.

The Residex repeat sales index showed a 2.5% capital gain on Melbourne house resales over the December quarter, taking the annual growth rate to 5.4%, which is substantially lower than a year ago when the capital gain on resales was recorded at 16.9%. Despite the weaker annual performance the second half of 2016 saw the quarterly rate of growth rebound strongly across the Melbourne detached housing market. In fact, the capital gain based on resales was down 1.4% for Melbourne houses over the first half of 2016 before rebounding to 6.9% growth over the second half of the year. A similar trend was seen across the unit sector; despite concerns around an oversupply of inner city units, the capital gain based on unit resales across Melbourne was 4.5% over the calendar year, with the majority of that gain being realised over the second half of 2016.

Brisbane housing market conditions have remained relatively subdued according to the Residex repeat sales index. Although there was as subtle improvement in the growth trend for houses over the second half of 2016, the annual growth rate has softened compared with 2015, with the capital gain on houses recorded at 2.4% over the year, while unit prices were negative over the year at -2.1%. With population growth gathering some pace in 2016, higher housing demand may start to push dwelling prices higher across Brisbane this year, however labour markets remain weaker than Sydney and Melbourne which is one of the key challenges of the Brisbane housing market blocking a higher rate of capital gain.

The Adelaide housing market remained in positive growth territory based on the capital gain from resales over the past calendar year. House and unit resales saw a subtle increase in capital gains over the second half of the year, however the overall growth trend remains relatively sedate across the Adelaide housing market. The subdued growth comes as population growth trends slow and the manufacturing sector faces some uncertainty as the local auto sector transitions towards a shutdown.

The trend of negative price movements in Perth has been sustained through 2016 with house prices down 4.1% over the 2016 calendar year based on resales, and unit prices down 6.0%. A more positive trend was developing over the second half of 2016, with a deceleration in the pace of capital gain declines. Listing numbers remain high across Perth at a time when housing demand is low, which is one of the primary reasons for prices continuing to fall, however a rebound in the commodity price index from mid-2016 may help to boost confidence and the economic conditions across the state in 2017.

The Hobart dwelling market has well and truly moved out of the doldrums, with the detached housing sector posting a 3.3% gain based on resales over the December quarter and recording a full calendar year growth rate of 7.4%. The unit sector has also seen some momentum gather, with the capital gain on unit resales tracking at 5.5% over the 2016 calendar year compared with a 1.0% fall over 2015. Improved tourism numbers and population growth, as well as the sheer affordability of housing are driving a sustained improvement in Hobart housing market conditions.

The Residex repeat sales index saw both Darwin house and unit returns continue their negative run, with the capital return on houses down -7.8% over the 2016 calendar year and unit returns down to -6.4%. Both dwelling types saw a quarter on quarter rise based on resales, however the trend across Darwin can be volatile due to the small size of the market. Other indicators remain soft across the market suggesting there is likely to be further falls in prices before this market starts to show a recovering trend.

The ACT has recorded a growth rate of 2.9% in house returns over the 2016 calendar year, which indicates a slowdown in the rate of capital gains based on resales after posting a 2015 capital gain of 8.0%. The unit sector has also seen a slowing of capital gain, albeit from a lower base than detached housing. The slower conditions based on resale show the opposite trend from other market measures which have been showing accelerating growth conditions across the nations capital.

"Co-investing with other people could help you fast-track your property portfolio and may even help you spread your risk. But there are hidden traps you need to be aware of.  Nila Sweeney, managing editor, Property Market Insider explains.

With property prices continuing to rise across Australia, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to break into the property market on your own.

Whether you’re trying to buy your first home or investment property, the sky-high prices now require you to have a bigger capital outlay.

As such, buying with other people who are not your spouse, is becoming attractive.

Buying with others allows you to crack the property market with a smaller deposit and share the costs of buying such as stamp duty, legal and bank fees.

While this can be a viable strategy and can make financial sense, there are potential hazards involved when buying with someone else.

Peter Koulizos, property author and professor explains these traps to be aware of.

1. Different investment ideas

People may have very different ideas about what to do with the property once it has been purchased. Some may see it as more profitable to knock down the existing dwelling and redevelop the land. Someone else may want to rent the property as it is or renovate and sell.

The problem that arises here is that because the options are so different; it is hard to reach a compromise.

Therefore, before even buying the property, make sure that everyone agrees to the investment strategy for this particular purchase.

Work out what you plan to do and put in writing before you buy the property.

2. Decision making

If one person contributes more capital in the beginning, do they have the upper hand for making decisions on what to do with the asset?

Perhaps the person that has put in less expects less profit at the end but presumes the decision making will be equally shared.

Similarly, if one person has more of a say in how the investment is managed, do they also take on more responsibility should their decisions not go to plan?

Profit share agreements, project management and other arrangements all need to be documented and agreed upon before buying.

3. Exit strategy

Even the best-laid plans can come undone. The financial strain may lead to the decision to sell an investment and when it is owned by a number of different people, it can be tricky.

Other owners may not want to sell just yet. They may not have the financial capacity to buy out someone who wants to sell and leave.

As you cannot sell just a part of a house, it comes down to selling the whole property, regardless of whether the market is in your favour.

Before you enter into a joint deal, you should work out the exit strategy and put this in writing.

4. No records

Sometimes people get very lax about having things in writing when they invest with family or friends. Perhaps because it doesn’t seem necessary or because it may be awkward to ask a friend to make arrangements in writing as opposed to a handshake.

The problem is that people forget, circumstances change, relationships change and financial stability can waver. By keeping plans casual and undocumented, you run a real risk of relationships being tested. 

While there are certainly advantages to going in with family and friends to buy an investment property, consider the risks and at the very least ensure everything is written down in a legally binding agreement.

It may seem awkward at first but it will be well worth it should unforeseeable circumstances arise.

5. Upgrade any outdated features

Simple cosmetic renos such as a fresh coat of paint, a new shower curtain or new blinds would go a long way in making your property more attractive to tenants.

Top insider tips!
Vet the other party rigorously.

You need to make sure you know the other buyers very well and understand their financial situation and motivation. Listen and trust your guts.

Always document everything.

Don’t invest with others without a legal agreement. This is crucial in protecting your interest and ensuring everyone agrees on how to deal with any situation that may arise.

Ask a lot of questions

If in doubt, ask. No matter how stupid you think, it’s better that you clarify any doubt that you may have before entering into a partnership.

Remember, you maybe sharing the risk, but you’re also equally responsible if the others falter. It’s better that you’re clear with any issues that you may have before you commit.

"I am a long-term property investor in Perth (over 20 years) and have an intricate understanding of the Perth property market. During that time, I have invested and followed the market in Perth closely and sense we are nearing the bottom of the cycle which may provide investors (both local and interstate investors) with some very good investment opportunities in Perth.

Right time to invest in Perth Property Market?

Experts are expecting 6-12 months before the market starts to rise due to an increase in consumer confidence, most likely after the State Elections. Reiwa.com.au‘s latest data to December 2016 shows the Perth median house price as $535,000 which is very competitive as compared to other capital cities across Australia.

There is no denying that Perth has suffered over recent years due to the downturn of the mining industry and unemployment is high; however, on other fronts, Perth and Western Australia is looking much brighter. Tourism is a huge industry providing Jobs and infrastructure. The government’s aim is to triple the state’s annual tourism income to $12 billion within three years and Tourism Western Australia aim is to increase the state’s visibility as a top tourism destination in the Asia Pacific region. Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia are important markets for Western Australia, adding a collective $484 million to the State’s economy and attracting more than 231,000 visitors in the year ending September 2016. While the Mining and resources sector has shrunk, it is still in operation and at a much more sustainable pace.

Perth is a lovely place to Live with a modern city and infrastructure, good public transport, top class schools and universities world class restaurants and great beaches. Taking into account the positives, I can see Perth being a great market to invest over the coming years as housing affordability is on the upswing. With Interest rates predicted to stay Low and prices Low, it might be the right time to start looking at investing in the Perth property market.

When buying in Perth do your research by property types: House and Land vs Apartment, and focus on where there is a demographic trend towards increasing demand. You need to look for areas where there’s a high demand and a low supply of land within close proximity to the city and water-views.

If you’re a first-home buyer, it’s a great time to buy, especially given the First Home Owners Grant had increased to $15,000. Look for areas close to public transport, shops, hospitals, schools, recreation, transport links and employment areas focus on location, location, location. Properties in a prime location will achieve stronger capital growth over the long term.

“Now is a great time to buy a well-located property in Perth for a competitive price.”

"With vacancies rising in many cities across Australia, you’re likely to deal with a vacant investment property sooner than later. Nila Sweeney, managing editor of PropertyMarketInsider.com.au explains what to do to rent it out quickly

There’s no doubt that having your investment property vacant for any period of time is a painful experience. For every week of vacancy, you’re losing money.

Taking a financial hit due to vacancy could result in a tight cash flow that may lead to you selling your property.

Depending on the amount of rent you charge and how many weeks the property remains vacant, it could take more than a year to make up for the loss if this vacancy continues for a long time.

If your property has been vacant for more than a month, it’s time to take drastic steps.

Here are some tips to help you deal with a vacant property and avoid further rental income loss.

1. Grill your property manager for details

Once your property becomes vacant, contact your property manager immediately. Ask them the following questions:

What are your thoughts about my property?
How does it compare and measure up against the competition?
Do you think the asking rent is fair or too high?
How many open homes have you done? How did they go?
What’s the feedback from potential renters?
Do you know how many properties in the area are currently vacant?
Was there any feedback from the open homes and what can be improved?
How are the other properties in the area faring in the current market?
What would you recommend we do to make the property more attractive to tenants so as to avoid another week of vacancy?
2. Review your asking rent and consider reducing it below the comparable properties in the area

A vacant property is earning zero dollars each week, whereas a reduced rent is still money in the bank. It’s better to lose a few dollars than a whole week or even a month’s worth of rent.

Depending on how saturated the market you’re in is, consider lowering your rent by $10 or even up to $50 each week to make your property more attractive to budget-conscious tenants.

Markets like Perth are currently experiencing rental oversupply and rising vacancy, which is prompting some landlords to slash their asking rent by up to $50 a week.

3. Offer a week or two free rent as a bonus for signing the lease

If your area is experiencing an influx of rental properties, you may need to up your game and consider offering a week or two of free rent to get tenants to sign the lease. You’re still taking a loss, but this is just for the short term.

4. Offer a 12-month pay-tv or Netflix subscription

For a few hundred dollars, you could entice your tenants to sign a lease and trump the competition.

5. Upgrade any outdated features

Simple cosmetic renos such as a fresh coat of paint, a new shower curtain or new blinds would go a long way in making your property more attractive to tenants.

6. Consider cross-listing your property with another agency

This simple strategy involves getting another real estate agency to list your home under their agency’s name but it will still be managed by your property manager.

This achieves two things:
Your property gets on top of the listing sites and will be more visible to potential tenants.
Your property doesn’t get too dated. Often, when a property sits on the market for too long, tenants start avoiding it suspecting that something might be wrong with it.

Of course, this only works if your property manager has a good relationship with other agencies (which are their competitors, too).

7. Write a compelling but honest ad

It could be worth spending some money to get a professional copywriter to write the copy for your rental ad.

If you want to do it yourself, make sure the headline grabs attention immediately and contains keywords that your tenants are searching for; for example, airy, spacious, affordable, newly refurbished, new kitchen, air conditioner, etc.

Make sure that the text reflects the features in your property. Be honest. Don’t be tempted to over promise just to lure tenants in. It will backfire on you big time.

8.Get professional photos shot to go with your ad

Mobile phone cameras might be getting better, but there’s no substitute for a professionally taken photo.

In a competitive market, don’t scrimp on cost – get a selection of high quality photos showing every part of the property. This would go a long way in getting tenants interested in your property.

Regardless of what strategy you choose, make sure it’s attractive to potential tenants without crippling your cash flow. You should carefully consider your situation and if it looks like you’re not going to get a tenant within your allowable timeframe, consider exiting the market before everyone else.

Published: 31 January, 2017.",2021_04_23,4-May-17,N/A,8 Ways to Quickly Rent Out Your Vacant Investment Property
"A New Year with new aspirations and new goals. Here are 5 reasons why I think property is still the stand out investment for 2017.

Interest Rates still at an all-time low

The word is that US interest rates will increase over the coming 12 months and Australian banks have already started to raise their rates under the guise that costs are increasing and returns diminishing to shareholders. Australian rates sit at historic lows of 1.5 %. Even if rates do increase along with the predicted US rates over the coming 12 months; by the end of the year they will still be low. If rates do increase, you will see an initial emotional reaction from the market, but when the dust settles investors and mortgage holders will realise that rates remain at very sustainable levels.

Demand is still high, no oversupply of property in key areas

Sentiment in the market is still strong with the outlook from the developers at Stockland and Mirvac. They have been advising that while the rate of price growth will slow, pent-up demand remains strong.

Mirvac’s outlook is that in the residential sector, conditions remain mixed nationally. In Sydney and Melbourne, indicators such as auction clearance rates point to solid demand supported by a competitive lending environment and increasing urban population growth. They say price growth remains positive in Sydney and Melbourne, relatively steady in Brisbane and weak to steady in Perth.  According to Australia’s richest property investor and developer Harry Triguboff, there is still a shortage of supply particularly in Sydney so demand is still outstripping supply. Banks have cracked down on property development finance which makes it more difficult for smaller developers to access funds for a project. This means that there will be less development and inevitably less housing coming onto the market over the coming years.

Bank funds readily available

Banks still view residential property as a solid long term investment, why else would they be prepared to lend you 80% of the purchase price? The mortgage investment sector is very competitive with the banks flushed with funds this can only be good news for investors and rates below the advertised interest rate should be negotiated. There has never been more choice of products, interest rates and numerous banks to select from that are willing to lend against property.

Long term investment

We all know that you invest in property for the long term. Property is not a short-term investment due to the cost of entering the market stamp duty etc. We have seen the statistics that show that over a 10-year period, property generally will double in value which equates to a capital return of 7% per annum in addition to a net of 3% rental return per annum that equates to a solid 10% return over that period.  You just need to be mindful that property works in cycles and although you may see extraordinary capital gain over a few years there will also be periods of little, zero or even negative growth.  Rents are more consistent, and over the longer term a combined 10% return per annum is what you could expect for the right property in the right area.

Negative Gearing for the short term at least

The federal Government has ruled out any changes to Negative Gearing legislation in the short term which means at least for the next couple of years property investors will benefit from the tax savings. The most important aspect of holding investments with borrowings is being able to fund any shortfall between the rent received and the cost of holding the property including the mortgage payments.  The tax benefits received, assist the investor with the funding of the shortfall to hold the property longer term.

 ",2021_04_23,4-May-17,N/A,5 Reasons Why Property is Still the Stand Out Investment for 2017
"Just because you’re pushing 50 or well into it already doesn’t mean you should give up hope of building a property portfolio you can retire on. Nila Sweeney, managing editor with Property Market Insider explains.

While there are obvious challenges such as the shorter time in the market as well as potential difficulty in accessing finance, you can still succeed as an investor even if you started late according to our experts.

“It’s absolutely still realistic to build a portfolio at this stage,” says Margaret Lomas of Destiny Financial Solutions.

“When people think of retirement they usually think that, on the day of retirement, whatever they have invested in they will need to liquidate, to drawn upon for living expenses or to top up a pension benefit.

“In reality, most people have some money in super, even if it is a smaller amount.  And so most older property investors can use super funds to top up their retirement income. This way, they won’t need to start drawing down from a property portfolio until possibly 5–10 years into retirement – at which stage they have had a further 5–10 years’ exposure to a growth market.”

How it works in real life

Lomas explains:

“If you have say 10 years to go before retirement and use this to acquire a large portfolio you can safely afford, then you can often use the 5–10 years post-retirement to see that portfolio grow and become even more positive cash flow, as rents increase.

“Many investors find that after 10–15 years, a property portfolio can be nicely positive cash flow, and that cash flow continues to grow as rents grow.  Often investors find that liquidation of a soundly cash flow positive portfolio is not necessary once they reach retirement, and so they can keep them and continue to see an improvement in their net worth over time,” says Lomas.

But there are traps to be aware of

There are a number of pitfalls waiting for any investor, however those who are approaching retirement could be more susceptible. These include:

Temptation to risk entire wealth position to make up for lost time

At this age, and having a feeling that you may have missed the boat, you may be compelled to risk your entire wealth in the hope that you’ll catch up.

This could mean putting all your money into buying speculative investments such as off-the-plan apartments or buying in areas with good cash flow but limited growth. Resist this at all cost.

Falling prey to spruikers

When you feel you’re running out of time, it’s easier to become a victim of a spruiker who promises an easy and instant solution, says Lomas.

“As such, you could find yourself trapped into a poorly performing asset, such as an off-the-plan apartment in an oversupplied area,” Lomas explains.

“If you’re in this demographic, beware of buying high yielding properties in one-industry towns where there is speculation and high risk that you may need to liquidate at a time when the market in that area is subdued or falling,” warns Lomas.

Ignore sound investment strategies in order to go faster

Ben Kingsley, author and director of Empower Wealth, points out that older investors may be tempted to go too fast and ignore the much-needed due diligence and planning when starting their investment journey.

“Try not to speculate with short-term investment horizons. I strongly believe that short-term investing in property is 10 years, so if you can’t afford to hold it for that long, then I’m not so sure investing in property is the right thing to do,” he says.

Strategies to help you invest safely
1. Avoid speculative properties

While it’s tempting to take on more risk at this stage, it’s important to stick to fundamentals when buying an investment property.

“I recommend not trying to be too clever and not buy speculative properties which may or may not do well in the future,” says Lomas.

“Look for lower risk property in areas with an abundance of families and lots of infrastructure rather than buy risky properties such as holiday properties, niche market properties or vacant land.

“Buy properties that are in high demand in areas with lots of the family demographics with a proactive council and a fast-growing population.”

2. Aim for reasonable yield

Avoid chasing just high yields as these properties tend to be located in areas with limited growth potential.

Equally, don’t buy a property with a very low yield in the hope that it will give better growth, otherwise you could find yourself having to sell before the growth comes.

3. Work out how much debt to take and how to pay it off

Being clear about how long before your income stops is important if you plan to borrow to invest says Kingsley. 

“No aspiring retiree will be able to retire if their property investment isn’t covering its own costs and returning a passive income. You need to work out the appropriate level of debt to take on and the strategy to pay this debt down.”

4. Figure out how much you realistically need to retire

You also need to be clear about how much wealth and income you’re going to need to live what you would consider as a ‘comfortable’ retirement.

“Let’s face it: for each of us this will be a different amount, so doing your numbers to work out what this is and then working back with your investment planning for this point in my view is the only way to work out the best strategy to adopt for one’s investing,” says Kingsley.

5. Keep leverage low

At this late stage, Kingsley points out that it would be too risky to take on high debt.

“It really is a case-by-case approach as to which strategy is going to be the right one for each household. That said, I don’t like seeing baby boomers taking on high levels of debt at their age, so I’d be recommending gearing levels no higher than 50% of the value of the property, which should see the property generating surplus cash flow from day one.  I’d be looking for properties that don’t have high holding costs that eat away at the passive income.”

6. Don’t ignore capital growth

While cash flow is important at this stage, capital growth should still remain a serious consideration according to Kingsley.

“Instead of just focusing on the higher type yielding property, which usually deliver lower capital growth, you need to consider the capital growth potential as well,” says Kingsley. “That’s because it gives you the option to potentially sell down the property say in 10, 15 or 20 years from the time you bought in and cashing in that capital growth over this period. If you have bought well, you should see a nice lump sum windfall if you do choose to sell.”

7. Get help from trusted professionals

See a qualified property investment adviser who is NOT trying to sell property to you, and become as educated as possible before taking a single step.

Bottom line

There’s no getting around the fact that older investors face a number of challenges when just starting out.

It’s harder to find a lender who will partner with you and understand your strategy. It’s easier to fall prey to spruikers in the hope that you can fast-track the strategy and you’re likely to be more willing to take elevated risk than normal.

“Too often I hear stories of late-comers all of a sudden realising they haven’t put away enough for their retirement so they think taking bigger risks to catch up is the way to go, but they could be risking their entire financial future in the process if the strategy they adopt turns sour,” says Kingsley.

"Virtual reality has been hyped as the next big thing in real estate for many years – will the trend finally take off this year?

New advances in the technology, price reductions and new consumer expectations could make 2017 the year of VR, according to experts at the INMAN New York real estate conference.

Ryan O’Hara, the CEO of US web portal Realtor.com, said now was the time for real estate agents to ‘lean in’ to the technology.

“The time is now to invest in it and get comfortable so you are ahead of the curve,” he said. 
“Everyone asks, when should I do this? When should I adopt? Do it now. Make it a differentiator when you want to win a listing. Show what you can do to stand out from other agents.”

One Washington agent at the Hacker Connect pre-conference, said he had won $5m in listings over the past 18 months by using VR in an area where the typical price of a home was around $300,000.

“I send examples to potential listings and say “This is what I will do for your home”. People are impressed and I’ve not lost a single listing since I started pitching with it,” the agent told the conference. He used a college student to edit the video together, making the final package an inexpensive but impressive way to stand out from his competition.

With video and floor plans and photos of homes in every angle, why do we need virtual reality as well?

Stephanie Davis from Virtual Xperience said the difference with VR is that users can walk around inside the space they are looking at which is much more immersive.

“It's all about presence,” she said. “You can see and feel the space you're in. You can sense the height of the room, spatial flow, the proportion. You get a feel of how far it is from the door to the furniture – it’s very compelling.”

In virtual reality, buyers can examine parts of the property that particularly interest them and there can be overlays to inform visitors of vital information. These can include visual pointers such as the type of granite on the benchtops, through to warranty information about when the airconditioner was installed or key parts of the contract.

VR is an ideal tool for new home and apartment builds giving buyers a much more realistic understanding of their new property in advance.

“When a buyer walks out onto the balcony and sees and hears the sea, and the seagulls of the new apartment they’re considering – they are completely sold,” said Ms Davis.

Markets that have strong foreign investment or sight unseen buyers are also prime contenders virtual reality.

Will buyers need to go to an agent’s office or display home site to see many different types of properties using 3D in a single showing? Or will agents make cardboard VR goggles the new fridge magnets of marketing? The jury is out.

But there are several different types of virtual reality – from video walk throughs, to ‘mobile virtual’ captured on small inexpensive devices, to the full bells and whistles 3D rendering that can deliver entire suburbs and cityscapes.

The ‘vomit factor’ of VR is also being addressed with new technology from Oculus Rift - making being immersed in VR now much smoother which removes the sense of car sickness.

Buying your own Oculus Rift device – and a laptop to run it – now costs about $US 2500. And you’ll need to edit each VR piece you create – so add the cost of a college student or someone from Freelancer.com

Alternatively, there are agencies that will deliver a VR service with costs ranging from $2 upwards of square foot of space shot and can take up to two weeks to deliver a VR render for a 1000 square foot property.

Matterport, which specialises in virtual reality for real estate, claims it is the most scalable way for agents to capture VR listings, taking just 24 hours to deliver a model in the US at a charge of 20c to 30c per square foot.

Australian companies involved in VR include Virtual Reality Ventures, Pixelcase and RapidVR. They follow a full service model.

"Do you know what the vendor discount level is in your suburb?

Vendor discounting is a great little data point that can tell you a lot about the supply and demand equation in your suburb and local market. It captures the average amount by which vendors selling by private treaty/normal sales are negotiating down by to get a sale. For example, the listing price might be $500,000 but the final selling price was $496,000.

Because vendor discounting looks specifically at private treaty sales – which cover between 70-90% of most markets – it is based on a lot of data which makes it a reliable indicator of market health.

The number is always negative because of the way it is calculated and any amount of -4% or below is strong. This indicates that vendors do not need to discount much to get a sale in those markets. And in some cases, may even be negotiating up.

But when vendor discounting starts to grow, it’s a sign that vendors are getting inflated ideas about what their properties are worth, and buyers are showing waning interest in the market. The end result is that properties stay on the market for a long time and days on market increases, until vendors realise that their expectations are out of alignment and come down to meet the market.

At the time of writing, there were 29 suburbs across Australia where vendor discounting was higher than 30% and a further 279 that had vendor discounting of 10% or higher. These are the areas where vendors are having to drop their prices significantly to tempt a buyer.

In contrast, there were more than 600 that had discounting levels below 4% and 13 where the discounting level was zero. These are the suburbs where the prices stated on the ticket are being paid, or pretty close to it is being negotiated.

So how can you use this information? If the vendor discount rate in your suburb is in high, especially double digit negatives, you need to take this into account as part of your sales plan. You will need to set a realistic price to obtain a sale, and should probably expect to be on the market longer (depending on how realistic your pricing is). You may also need to market hard to attract a single buyer.

If the vendor discounting is low, and this is combined with a low time on market number, it means your pricing strategy may be able to be more aggressive. You’re probably going to get a strong offer very quickly and may choose to hold out to see what else is offered. It may also mean an auction is a good option for your property.

Use the movement of the time on market figure to decide if vendor discounting is going to go up or down. A longer time on market means the discounting is also likely to grow.

"When buying or selling, one of the really useful pieces of information to be in possession is the median sale price for the suburb you are in.

These figures are released at a capital city level every month, and are used as a benchmark to determine if the market is going up, down or sideways. The month by month movement of the median sales price is the barometer that identifies the levels of market growth (or easing) and even small changes month to month can be seized upon to proclaim that the market is either overheating or in dire risk of complete catastrophe.

But understanding median prices in a bit more depth will help you cut through the noise and make more confident decisions when it comes to buying or selling a property.

Always know your median price for your suburb

Knowing your capital city median price is not enough when buying or selling. You need to know what the median for your area in particular as even suburbs within postcodes can vary quite considerably depending on the features and attributes of the suburb, and the demand for property in different areas.

Know your median price for your property type

Within each suburb, houses and units  have quite different median prices – with houses usually having higher medians than units on the basis that the land value makes them worth more. The median performance – ie: growth – can often be quite different between houses and units too. For example, prices for houses may be growing more strongly than units if there is a shortage of stock on the market and it is even possible for one type of property to be growing while the other is easing.

Understand that a median sales price is based on what is selling

It is a common mistake that buyers or sellers assume the median sales price is the median price of all property in the suburb. It’s not. It’s the median price of all property that is selling in the suburb. That means if your suburb is full of four bedroom homes which are quite expensive, but most of the sales are happening in cheaper 2 and 3 bedroom homes with people trying to enter the market, then the median price may be lower than you’d expect. (So if you are the owner of a 4 bedroom home, don’t freak out). Equally, if a new block of luxury units goes to market when your suburb is dominated by flats built in the 1960s or 1970s, the median price might be higher than you’d expect because the expensive new units are where the sales were made. (It doesn’t automatically follow that every unit in the suburb is now worth that higher amount, so if you own one of those cheaper apartments, don’t automatically count your chickens).

Try to discover what the median price is for properties with similar features

The example above shows that different types of properties will probably have different medians. If possible, try to find out what the median price is of a property with the same number of bedrooms, bathrooms or cars to yours. This data usually requires some digging, and may be based on small numbers (so be a bit volatile), but it can be insightful.

"Reports that the steam is coming out of the property market are currently so insistent, you could be forgiven for thinking that real estate Armageddon is around the corner.

But the headline view overstates the negative. While the market is currently coming off the boil, it does not mean a dramatic drop everywhere is inevitable. Every good cook knows after you’ve reached boiling point, you traditionally turn down the heat but usually continue to simmer. The result is the dish remains very hot – it’s just not heating at the same rapid rate. Good cooks also know that it’s a rare recipe that demands going from extremely hot to cold in just a few minutes. Most dishes take time to really cool.

And so it is often with property markets. Easing growth doesn’t mean we’re all about to be ruined. It means that prices no longer have the heat set to ‘high’. For sellers it’s an indication that now is a pretty good time as the current high prices are likely to be stabilising.

To understand if now is good time to sell in your market, you need to understand your local data. This will also guide you in understanding the kind of sale process you are most likely to experience.

Ask your agent to find out the following data points (or find one who will) or check out the suburb profiles on realestate.com.au or propertyvalue.com.au.

Time on market: This is the figure that explains how long it is taking for properties to sell under private treaty. In hot markets, the figure is typically low – less than a month. In poorly performing markets, it is typically high over 75 days or more.

When you see this figure edging higher, you know that buyers are cooling off, and vendors are starting to expect too much for their property. When you see this number going down, it means the conditions to sell are improving.

Vendor discounting: This tells you how much private treaty sellers (which make up about 80% of the market nationally) are having to discount or negotiate down from their original stated price on average in order to achieve a sale.

In a strong market, this figure will typically be very low – usually around 4% or under. When you see this figure rise over 8% or more, it is an indicator that vendors in those suburbs have price expectations out of alignment with what buyers will pay (ie: they want too much).

If you need to sell in a market that has a high vendor discount level, don’t panic. Sales are still possible, but you will need to think carefully about the pricing of your property and take advice based on what is really selling, not what other properties around you are listed for.

Published: 24 January, 2017.",2021_04_23,4-May-17,N/A,Is Now a Good Time to Sell?
"If you're looking to sell your property this summer, you may want to consider these easy, simple tricks to maximise your selling price.Nila Sweeney, managing editor at Property Market Insider spoke to property author and professor Peter Koulizos for his top tips

When is the best time to sell your property? Is it during winter when there is lesser competition or at springtime when market activity is at its peak?

Experts say, the best time to sell is when you don’t have to. This way, you have the luxury of timing the market.

But what if for financial reasons or change in circumstance you need to sell as soon as possible, and it’s summer time?

The good news is there are simple tweaks you can do to maximise your selling price. Peter Koulizos, property professor and author, shares his top tips.

Appeal to the home buyer

While you may be selling an investment property, you want to appeal to the homebuyers as well.  In general, homebuyers are more emotional when buying their home compared to investors.

You don’t have to spend a lot of money either. Here are a few things you can do to update your property quickly and cheaply.

Top tips!
Clean the carpet or polish the floor board.
Paint. It’s the best value mini-makeover you can do.
Clean the property thoroughly.
Tidy up the garden, especially the front yard. Front yards, in particular, are important because they are often the first aspect of the property that potential buyers will see.
Turn up the summer appeal

If you’re going to rent furniture to improve the look and feel of the property before selling, also known as staging, think summer colours and pieces.

Top tips!
Choose light, neutral colours.
To sell in summer, less is more. Opt for a minimalist décor.
Replace darker rugs, curtains, cushions and blankets with lighter colours.
Consider adding a few nautical themed pieces.
Make the most of the outdoor areas and set them up to show off their potential for outdoor meals and entertaining.
Ensure all pools and water features are clean and/or switched on to impress buyers.
Use light to your advantage

People are generally drawn to natural light, so the more natural light you can let in, the better.

Top tips!
If there are curtains in the house, either remove them or replace them with lighter colours and textures to add a relaxed, ‘summery’ feel.
Dark, heavy curtains don’t add appeal and can also make rooms look smaller.
Use good quality lights and lamps.
Turn on all the lights and lamps before inspections.
Open all the curtains and blinds.
If possible, hold inspections before the sun sets unless of course, the property looks especially good at sunset!
Be flexible to inspections

Summer can be a somewhat hectic time of year with school holidays, end of year functions, holidays and Christmas and New Year celebrations. There’s also a lot of sport on at this time of year, such as cricket and tennis that have a tendency to keep people glued to the TV screen.

Top tips!
Given the busy nature of the summer months, be open to more flexible inspection times.
Try and avoid weekends too close to Christmas or New Year as people are often on holiday or too busy to make time for viewings.
Keep your property cool

There is nothing worse than walking into a hot, stuffy home on an equally hot and stuffy day. It won’t help make a good first impression for potential purchasers.

Top tip!
Ensure that before the open inspections, the air-conditioning has been on for a while.
Exceed expectations

If you really want to impress, offer a cool drink to your prospective purchasers. Have some cold sparkling water and glasses ready to offer people looking through your property.

It adds a nice touch, gives potential buyers a way to remember the house and also helps create a casual atmosphere. This may need to be discussed with an agent if they have been engaged in selling the property.

Every time of year has good and bad points when it comes to selling property but make the season work for you, and it won’t matter when you sell.

"The first question every vendor wants to know is how much you will get for your property. But the second question is probably the most important – and that is “how long will it take to sell my home?”

The time on market question is the one tied most tightly to your sanity. A very fast sale can feel a bit wham, bam, thank you ma’am, while a very slow sale – or the agony of wondering if your home will ever sell – can drive you around the bend as weekend after weekend the agent puts the open sign out, and no one shows.

Like most things, the answer to how long it takes to sell is “it depends”. But that doesn’t mean you should remain in the dark.

The first thing you should do is find out your local “average time on market” figure. 

Time on market is the figure that explains how long it is taking on average for properties to sell under private treaty or a normal negotiated sale. In hot markets, the figure is typically low – less than a month and frequently around 20 days or so. In poorly performing markets, it is typically high over 75 days or more. In awful markets, the number will go over 100 days.

Time on market is one of my favourite statistical points as it reveals an awful lot about the mindsets of buyers and sellers. When you see this figure edging higher, you know that buyers are cooling off, and the price expectations of vendors are edging a little too high for buyers to tolerate. When you see this number going down, it means the conditions to sell are improving and it’s moving towards a sellers’ market.

Even if the time on market number for your suburb is high, don’t panic. There are decisions you can make that will help reduce this period. Going to auction and committing to going ahead with the best offer on the day is one way to ensure a set timeframe to sell your home (most auction campaigns last four weeks). Alternatively, if the time on market figure is high, make sure you set your price very competitively, and don’t wait around for better offers when the first one comes in around your ballpark.

"While buying your first investment property and building a property portfolio is exciting, it can also be a little scary.  Nila Sweeney, managing editor with Property Market Insider spoke to successful investor Marissa Schulze of Rise High Financial Solutions on how to overcome these initial fears and reduce your risks if you have the right strategy at the outset.

Investing in property is scary and overwhelming for any beginner or even for some seasoned investors. Here are some of the biggest lessons successful property investors like Marissa Schulze learned to fail-proof their investments.

Lesson Number 1: You have to commit for the long term

Property investment can be a low risk and predictable way to build your wealth and retirement. However, you need to be in it for the long term.

Property investing is not a get rich quick scheme. It’s more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow.

Don’t expect results overnight and don’t get disheartened when going through the ups and downs of the market.

Top insider tips!
Understand and manage your cash flow
This is the best way to ensure that you can ride the ups and downs of the market and still maintain and build a strong property portfolio over the long term.
Cash flow is everything and the way you manage your cash flow will ultimately determine your success or failure as an investor.
Know where your money is going
You need to clearly understand your own personal spending and exactly how much of your income you can contribute towards your investing.
Know the costs of holding on to your property
You also need to understand exactly how much each property in your portfolio (and each property you wish to add to your portfolio) is costing you before and after tax and how this will change if interest rates go up to say 7-8%.
Have a sufficient buffer
You need to have enough cash for you hold the investment property over the long term regardless of what happens to its value and regardless of whether interest rates increase or not.
If you have calculated this correctly, then you will never be in a position to sell and lose money.
Buy the best property you can afford
Stick to a firm rule of only buying property that you can afford to hold forever.
A property cycle is generally about 10 years. The earlier you start investing and the more cycles you go through, the better off you will be.
With property investing your ‘time in’ the market is one of the most critical elements to your success. So don’t procrastinate.
Lesson Number 2: Use your money wisely

It’s not how much money you make that matters, but rather what you do with your money that will ultimately determine your financial success.

For every dollar you earn, you should always put aside a percentage of that income towards investing and a percentage of the income towards rainy day savings before you pay your bills or spend money on entertainment or living expenses.

To take control of your finances and manage them like the wealthy, here are three steps you may want to consider.

Top insider tips!

You may like to show some leniency to tenants who have fallen on hard times. Perhaps you’re a nice person. But your insurer is not. It may not be your choice to allow the tenant some more time, that decision may invalidate your insurance policy.

Identify areas where you can save money

Look at your current spending and identify things that you can change that will make a difference to your savings while not greatly impacting your lifestyle (e.g.,. taking your lunch to work instead of buying it every day could save you $2,500-$3,000 per year).

Commit to paying yourself first

Make a commitment to pay yourself a percentage of your income that you can use to invest. This amount is the proportion of your income that you can live without. Try to commit a minimum of 10% of your income towards your investment fund.

Make it automatic

A great way to get started is to open two different bank accounts as follows:

The first bank account
This is where your income is paid into and where your bills and living expenses come out of. This bank account is linked to an ATM card, and you have internet banking access to make internet payments from this account. You can call this account on your internet banking ‘everyday account’.
The second bank account
This is your investment bank account. This account is not linked to an ATM card and the money in it is harder to access. Once money goes into this account, it’s important that you don’t take it out for any reason other than what the money is for (i.e.,. Investing and building your wealth). Call this account on your internet banking ‘investment account’.

Once you have your separate accounts, you could ask your employer to split your pay into the separate accounts, so that 10% automatically goes into investment account before you even see your pay.

If your employer is not able to do this, you can set up automatic periodic transfers on your internet banking programmed to transfer 10% of your income to your investment account on the day that you will receive your pay.

If you are self-employed, every time you receive income into your business, just as you would put aside 10% for GST, at the same time you should be transferring 10% into your investment account.

The easier you can make the process and the more automated the process is, the better your chances of sticking with it and turning your life around.

Lesson Number 3: Surround yourself with the right people

One of the best things you can do is to build your own team of experts who you could trust, who understand your goals and had a proven track record for achieving their own property investment success for themselves and their clients.

Top insider tips!

When choosing your experts, look for the following attributes:

They’ve done what you wanted to achieve
While the right credentials and qualifications are essential, first-hand property investment experience is so much more valuable to look for someone.
Genuine positive client reviews
This shows that they’re doing the right thing for their clients. Also look for other attributes such as their strategies and depth of market knowledge. This way, you can significantly fast-track your progress and avoid costly mistakes along the way.

The truth is anyone can be a successful Investor. Regardless of your income, if you can commit to sticking with it over the long term, spending less and saving more as well as seeking guidance from the right experts, you too, can succeed and create wealth through property investing.

"When choosing a real estate agent, there is more to the transaction than just the amount of commission he or she charges. Agents often have an arsenal of other skills they can bring to a transaction to help a vendor that even they may not realise.

When you meet with your agent, here are three new things you can ask them to assess the level of service they offer:

Repairs and making your home ready for sale.
So your agent has assessed your home and pointed out the small repairs here and there that need to be done to get your home in tip top condition for sale – fix the leaking taps, paint the doors, new door knobs in the kitchen, repair the gutters, wash down the house.

Before you buy in to the additional stress that comes with trying to coordinate a multitude of tradespeople – or nagging your spouse - ask your agent whether this is a service they offer. Every real estate agent has a property management team for whom coordinating repairs and maintenance is their day job. You will need to pay the cost of the tradespeople and repairs and your agent is likely to charge you a coordination fee, but if you’re time poor and working to a market deadline, this can be a lifesaver.
 
Market reports and valuations.
Every agent has access to powerful databases that are constantly analysing the property market – including your property. (Whether they know how to use them properly is a different matter. Tip: choose an agent who does!)

If you are anxious about the price setting of your property, ask your agent to run you an Automated Valuation Report. This uses similar formulae used by the banking industry to give you an insight into your property’s value (which is often different from its sale price which will hopefully be higher). You can also ask your agent to see suburb statistics to give you an indication of the health not just of the property market you are selling in, but also buying in.
 
Ask for help buying.
So you’ve sold your home, got the price you wanted and now, you need to buy. Your first port of call should be your selling agent – after all you’ve paid them a truck load of commission and you’re within your rights to expect some love. If the property you want to buy is being sold at auction and the idea of bidding terrifies you, ask your agent if they can help you develop an auction purchasing strategy. Really good agents will not only help you understand what the home you want to bid on is probably going to sell for, but may even attend the auction with you and bid on your behalf.

In the year to November 2016, Australian dwelling values saw an increase of 4.49%. This is above the 3.77% annual growth average since 2009, when Australia felt the effects of the 2008 GFC. However, growth was below the November 2015 figure of 6.63%.

Hobart Houses Top Growth in November

Table 1[1] shows the repeat sale growth summary for the major Australian dwelling markets at November. The highest growth for the November quarter was in Hobart houses, where the median repeat sale value increased 2.39% in the last 3 months. Hobart houses also had the strongest growth of the major aggregate markets in 2016, with a 6.01% increase in the year to November.

While these figures are low relative to the double digit growth seen in 2014-15 (for example Sydney houses increased 15.71% in the year to November 2015), major Australian housing markets are likely to return to norms of single digit dwelling growth as softening economic conditions catch up with dwelling demand.

ACT houses increased in value over the quarter, and displayed a healthy return of 3.32% over the year. However, the Mr Fluffy buyback scheme continues to put pressure on this market, with high construction costs potentially inflating growth figures.

Major Queensland and South Australia markets remained flat over the quarter, though some markets outside of the capital cities pushed up regional growth figures.

Hobart dwelling values were expected to increase over 2016 as those priced out of the Sydney and Melbourne markets looked elsewhere for affordable capital growth strategies. The latest Residex State Market Report highlights the many benefits of the area, which include excellent agricultural produce, its popularity as a ‘staycation’ and international destination as the Australian dollar has fallen over the year, and its relative affordability.

It is important to keep in mind that Tasmania still has geographical challenges with freight costs and labour force limitations. However, interstate migration to the area may increase due to the aforementioned growth factors, which would also bring new skills and services the area.

Furthermore, as Hobart becomes more expensive due to higher interstate investment, and assuming that demand remains strong in 2017 (which it may not, given recent GDP indicators), spill-over of growth may occur in other parts of the island, such as the second largest city in Tasmania after Hobart - Launceston.

Launceston has some solid growth fundamentals, including tertiary education institutions, shopping outlets and beautiful historical buildings which promote tourism and dwelling demand for sought-after aesthetics. Already, 2016 has seen a 4.65% increase in Launceston house values and a 1.68% rise in unit values. Graph 1 shows the similarity in growth cycles across the two cities, though there was a slight growth divergence between the cities toward the end of 2013.

Expansionary Monetary Policy versus Dwelling Growth

Melbourne houses and units were also strong performers in the November quarter, with quarterly growth of 2.18% and 1.57% respectively. Despite persistently high prices, Sydney houses and units were not far behind, increasing 2.18% and 1.30%.

Sydney and Melbourne continued to be popular with investors as well as overseas and interstate migrants over 2016. According to ABS lending data from October this year, approximately 49% of new loans (excluding those for re-financing) were comprised of investors. Part of the resurgence in investor activity may be explained by expansionary monetary policy.

In September, Sydney dwellings experienced an uplift in annual capital growth - following the August rate cut decision - while Melbourne growth continued to ease. However, as the rate of capital gain across Melbourne has typically shown a slight lag on Sydney, Melbourne could also see growth rates pushed up in Q1 2017. These movements are displayed in Graph 2.

Hobart units were another stand out market over the October 2016 quarter, with capital growth of 4.72%. Growth has been driven by affordability and the increased popularity of Tasmania as a domestic and international tourism hub.

Around the latest cash rate decision in November, markets and commentators alluded to the idea that the cash rate was at the trough of its cycle, and the RBA would move to increase rates in 2017. This was partly because of the market confidence created around the expansionary policies of president elect Donald Trump. Despite no movement in the RBA cash rate since August, Australian lenders have recently started to lift their variable mortgage rates in response to higher international funding costs.

In any case, it could be that the anticipation of higher interest rates in 2017 created high investor demand for loans this quarter, while low interest rates can still be locked in for a period of time.

However, recent market indicators suggest the RBA is not in a position where it can begin to increase rates. September saw a seasonally adjusted decline in GDP of - 0.5% over the quarter, driven largely by a -0.52% fall in public investment. This marks one of the sharpest drops in GDP growth in 25 years.

In his delivery of the Mid-Year Fiscal and Economic Outlook, Treasurer Scott Morrison announced a reduction in the 2016-17 projected deficit from $37.1 billion to $36.5 billion, but the total deficit over the next three years would increase by $10.4 billion. Leading credit rating agencies maintained Australia’s AAA credit rating; maintaining good credit may see the government contain public expenditure even further.

Given the fragility of the Australian economy in labour and growth figures, a steady cash rate target may be expected over the first quarter of 2017. Despite low interest rates potentially slowing the downswing in Sydney and Melbourne, a decline in government expenditure and increased mortgage rates for investors from major banks may see a steady reduction in the rate of capital gain in these markets during 2017.

"Varying from state to state, another factor contributing to the high entry cost to housing is Stamp Duty, particularly in Australia’s largest two capital cities.

Levied by each state and territory and payable by the receiver when a property is transferred, stamp duty varies remarkably across the states and territories based on the price of the property, the type of buyer (owner occupier / first home buyer / investor) and the type of property.  CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless said, “Calculating how much stamp duty is applicable on a property purchase can be confusing due to the significant differences regionally, but also due to the complexity of rules, concessions and limits that are applied to the calculation of stamp duty.” 

Based on the median dwelling value across each capital city, stamp duty estimates can range from a whopping $32,680 in Melbourne to a modest $9,000 in Brisbane.

Median dwelling value

Mr Lawless said, “Even though the median dwelling value is $200,000 higher in Sydney compared with Melbourne, the cost of stamp duty on the median valued home is actually slightly lower in Sydney, at $31,763, due to higher stamp duty rates in Victoria.”

Estimated stamp duty payable
on median value dwelling

In some states, first-time home buyers can be offered substantial concessions on stamp duty; however there is generally an upper limit.  For example, first home buyer property transactions in Victoria with a price tag of $600,000 or less will enjoy a 50% reduction on their rate of stamp duty.  In Queensland, first home buyers purchasing a property priced less than $550,000 can realise a discount of more than $8,000.

Stamp duty rates can also be higher for investors.  Surprisingly, Mr Lawless observed that New South Wales, which is the state with the largest proportion of investors, does not charge a premium rate of stamp duty on this segment of the market. The three largest states also charge a stamp duty premium on property purchasers by foreign buyers.

He said, “Because stamp duty costs are percentage based, as dwelling values move higher, stamp duty costs can rise disproportionately faster due to bracket creep.  Over the past five years dwelling values in these two cities have increased by 62% and 38% respectively which implies at least a commensurate rise in stamp duty costs in these cities. The high transactional costs associated with housing are likely to be one factor that is contributing to a slowdown in the number of sales across the country.” 

While stamp duty is generally the largest transactional cost associated with buying, there are other costs such as building and pest inspections, conveyancing,  removalists and more that also need to be factored in and are likely to be dampening participation in the housing market.  Mr Lawless said, “Add to this the fact that most lenders will be seeking a 20% deposit and the barriers to entry become even more substantial.”

For state governments, stamp duty is one of the largest revenue sources.  In the 2014-15 financial year, state and local government taxation revenue was recorded at $89.278 billion having increased by 7.0% over the year.  The taxation revenue was comprised of $45.203 billion or 50.6% from property related taxes (mostly stamp duty and municipal rates).  While total tax revenue increased 7.0% over the year, property tax revenue increased by 10.5% highlighting that property taxes are the largest source of taxation revenue for state and local governments and are rising at a rapid pace.

Mr Lawless said, “If transaction numbers across the housing market continue to trend lower, state governments are likely to encounter a budget hole as stamp duty revenue falls.   For this and associated reasons, we may find state governments become more serious about considering a broader based land tax that is applicable to all property owners rather than a stamp duty that is payable only across the small percentage of properties that transact each year.”

"One of the most common mistakes home sellers make is to not do their homework about how much their home is worth before they list.

Too many sellers hear about a couple of sales near their place, make assumptions about how their property is better in relation to what sold and then put themselves completely in the hands of their real estate agent to tell them the price they’re likely to receive. This is even more prevalent when property prices are strong.

The end result can be a slower than expected sale, disappointing offers and belief that their agent has been ineffective or lazy. Regardless of market conditions, it always pays to be prepared.

Here’s three steps you can easily take to make sure you’re prepared and can earn the title of a smart seller.

1. Look up properties like yours online

It takes just half an hour so there’s no excuse not to spend some time on your computer or mobile phone looking up properties in your area that have similar features to yours. Check out the recent sales section and look to understand how properties are selling in your area (by auction or by private treaty) and how much properties are selling for and how they are being presented.

Make a note of the lowest sale price that was achieved by a property like yours, the mid point and the highest price of a property. Ask yourself how your property compares and would you be happy selling for the lowest price achieved? Identify the factors that you think may be the reason why the cheapest property sold for what it did (location, room size, age of the fitout). Repeat the exercise with the highest selling property. And then ask yourself where on the scale yours compares.

2. Visit some open for inspections

Whenever you sell, you need to check out the competition – the properties that will be competing for buyers’ attention – and wallet - with yours. As part of your internet search above, identify the properties currently on the market that are like yours and make sure you attend an open for inspection.

How do these properties compare to yours? Are they bigger, older, more modern, better furnished? How does their presentation compare? What can you do to your property to make sure it stands out against the competition in a positive way? Sometimes it helps to take a friend who will be brutally honest with you in your comparison.

But the primary thing you’re doing here is taking a sanity check – making sure that your home is in the same league as what else is being sold, and your expectations are not wildly unrealistic.

3. Get a property report

Your real estate agent will do a comparative market appraisal which will show your how your property compares to others on the market (which won’t be a surprise to you if you’ve followed steps 1 and 2) but it may also be worthwhile getting a property report to get a real understanding of price.

Ask your mortgage broker or bank if they can offer you a report, see your property’s value online from a site such as www.propertyvalue.com.au or purchase a report from www.residex.com.au

Most property reports are based on algorithms (similar to those used by the banks and property valuers) that compare the features of your property (land size, property age, number of bedrooms etc) to properties that are similar and near to yours that have sold recently. It then comes up with a price range and midpoint.

Property reports usually always have a confidence rating of the price they have generated – anything around 10% or lower confidence means the algorithm had good examples to compare to and the price is likely to be pretty close. Higher percentages mean there may not have been many like sales nearby and so the algorithm has struggled to make a good match.

However, having a property report can be really helpful to give you a good base point. It also gives you an indication of what financial institutions are likely to lend against, and in doing so, gives you another sanity check. If the price in your head is wildly different (higher) than the property value report, it’s a sign you need to bring yourself into check.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia announced it will hold the official cash rate in December at 1.50%. The decision comes amid the election of Donald Trump in the US, NAB and Westpac increasing investor related mortgage rates and anticipation of low GDP growth figures.

Before Donald Trump became the president elect, there remained some conjecture that Australian interest rates were not at the trough of the cycle. But, as Trump's election platform hinted at inflationary policies around tax cuts and infrastructure, markets have signalled expectations of growth and inflation. This gives the US Federal Reserve room to increase interest rates without dampening inflation: it is a case of potential fiscal policy taking the burden off monetary policy.

What does this mean for Australia? An increase in Fed rates is a signal of increased global economic strength. It puts downward pressure on the Australian dollar. A lower AUD and stronger global economic growth should boost exports, and takes pressure off the RBA to lower the cash rate.

It is important to remember however, that before Trump became the president elect, further cuts by the RBA to 1.25% in 2017 seemed plausible. This was due to record low wage growth of 1.9% in the year to September, low underlying inflation of 0.35% in the month of September, and slowed growth in residential dwelling construction and approvals.

Australian labour markets have continued to deteriorate as jobs are lost in mining and manufacturing, and the construction sector slows. In the year to October, Australia has lost approximately 50,000 full time jobs, and Trump’s election has not changed those shaky fundamentals. In its last rate decision until February next year, the RBA has held rates steady among uncertainty of how global performance may shape the domestic situation.

Monday saw Westpac announce an increase on interest-only home loans, while NAB announced a 15 basis point increase to investor home loans. The initiative of banks to increase margins in the residential lending segment could be beneficial while the RBA maintains expansionary monetary policy of 1.5%.  

This is because higher interest rates on mortgages may divert capital from housing, making cheap credit available for other projects such as infrastructure, which would help to grow the economy.

The effect of interest rates on the housing market continues to be a concern for the RBA, who last month noted a “considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities”. Meanwhile, the CoreLogic Hedonic Home value index saw a decline in the Melbourne unit market in November of 3.2%, and the Brisbane unit index was down 0.9% in the same period, suggesting construction and growth in the unit segment may start to moderate.

Tomorrow marks the release of Q3 GDP figures, with numbers expected to be flat, or even negative among low levels of demand and private investment. One positive for certain markets around Australia is the increase of the commodity price index, which rose to its highest level since May 2016 in October.

However, among sluggish economic growth, low wage growth and inflation, a rate rise from the RBA may not be expected until at least the second half of 2017 or potentially the year after.

"If you make money when you buy, it goes without saying that negotiating a good deal is crucial for your success as an investor. But how do you get the upper hand? Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Property Market Insider grilled Australia’s leading buyers agents for their secret sauce.

When it comes to real estate, you can negotiate practically everything.

From the price you pay, to the length of time you need to settle, to having access to the property prior to settlement, all the way to the size of your deposit – everything is negotiable.
However, negotiating isn’t just a matter of asking for a discount.

It’s both an art and a science according to Cate Bakos, founder of Cate Bakos Property.

“Negotiating well is a science as it relates to the research and due diligence that you must do before you make an offer. As a well-organised negotiator, you should be able to defend your position with fact,” says Bakos.

“The art, however, is where many people are challenged. Knowing when to offer, when to stay quiet, when to stand firm and when to agree to terms is critical.”

If you think this feels like a lot of work, you’re right. But mastering a few negotiation tricks would go a long way in successfully building a solid portfolio.

The good news is, you don’t have to be a Harvey Specter (Suits) to walk away with a sweet deal. Our experts generously shared their secret sauce so you too can nab a good deal on your next purchase.

Insider's secret sauce for negotiating a sweet deal
Understand the vendor’s motivation

Knowing what the vendor wants and expects is the key to negotiating powerfully. Realise that vendors are driven by things other than the price. For example, some may need to sell in a hurry because they’ve bought somewhere else. They may need to move to an aged care facility or simply want to cash out and they have no time pressure.

 “Not all vendors are driven by price,” says Bakos. “More often than not, they have other requirements or desires.”

Therefore, knowing what these desires and constraints are would help you tailor your offer and stand a better chance of getting the deal to move in your favour.

Treat the selling agent well

You need the selling agent on your side for many reasons. You need them to give you information about the vendor’s motivation and expectations.

You can only negotiate through the agent, assuming that the vendor uses one. Therefore, you need to build a good, trusting rapport with the agent to get the information and support you need.

Understand how the vendor prefers to sell

In a hot market, most vendors prefer to sell via auction. But some still prefer to sell via private treaty. Don’t waste your time making pre-auction offers if the vendor has decided to sell via auction as this would undermine your position.

Be realistic about pricing

It’s easy to get so focused on driving a hard bargain that you lose sight on how much the property is really worth.

Miriam Sandkuhler, director with Property Maven, says that being realistic about your offer is a better strategy than trying to squeeze every last cent from the deal.

“Buying the property at the fair market value that will outperform the average rather than driving a hard bargain is a better outcome than to miss out altogether because you tried too hard to bargain,” says Sandkuhler.

Sharpen your best negotiation weapon by researching hard

Doing extensive research before you make an offer ensures that you’re armed with the information you need. This also enables you to make a sound decision quickly and confidently.

“Doing your due diligence in a property before making an offer is the best way to ensure you’re paying a fair price,” says Sandkuhler. “It may also give you further negotiating power when you make an offer after the property has been passed in at auction.”

To get the market intel that you need, you have to attend lots of auctions, go to as many open houses as you can and speak to a number of selling agents.

You should also keep an eye on the auction results to see how much properties are going for and which ones have been passed in.

“This helps you gauge if the asking price is realistic and helps you make a decision based on facts rather than emotion,” says Sandkuhler.

Always include finance and building and pest inspection clauses in the contract

Even if you’ve already gotten a pre-approval from your lender, don’t assume that you will get the loan in the end. Therefore, it’s a good strategy to always include a finance clause in the contract to protect you in case your lender decides not to approve your home loan application in the end.

What this means is that you can pull out of the deal if you don’t get the finance from your bank. You may lose part of the deposit you paid during the negotiation, but it’s a small price to pay compared to the headache and stress of trying to get finance within a very short period of time.

Equally important to include is the pest and building inspection. Even if you’re a seasoned buyer, you cannot and should not underestimate the value of having a trained inspector go over the property for you to ensure you’re not spending the money you save via negotiation fixing the problems you missed because you didn’t engage a professional.

Always have a backup plan and let the agent know it

You can’t always win a negotiation so it’s important to have a Plan B in case the outcome doesn’t go in your favour.

Don’t start a negotiation without a backup plan. Having alternatives just in case allows you to negotiate more confidently as you know you have other opportunities to pursue elsewhere.

Letting the agent know that you have options will also create a sense of urgency and pressure for them to move the negotiation forward. “No agent would want to risk losing a serious buyer,” says Bakos.

Leave something on the table

Yes, you want to buy low. It’s tempting to take advantage of the vendor’s unfortunate situation, especially if they need to sell in a hurry due to financial strife.

But it’s always important to treat people humanely and make them feel they’ve also won something during the negotiation.

“Negotiating needs to represent a win/win,” says Bakos. “Sometimes a vendor may be in an unfortunate situation where they have to sell under difficult circumstances. They may not achieve the price they had hoped for, but it’s a less painful transaction for them if other ‘wins’ are achieved. This can be a shorter settlement, a lease-back arrangement post-settlement (if they need time to search for or build the next home), or if the offer is completely unconditional and gives them certainty of a sale. Different elements motivate and entice different sellers.”

"Australians have always looked to the USA for economic indicators, if the US sneezes we catch the cold was the catch phrase…The Global Financial Crisis in 2008 started in the USA and quickly sent world markets into a downward spiral, but what would happen if the World’s 2nd Biggest Economy China ‘sneezed’?

Over the last decade the Chinese economy has exploded, with extraordinary growth rates above 10%. Although more recently this has tapered back to between 6-7%.

But now, there is real concern both inside and outside of China for the rising debt levels as it reaches record highs. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned China to stem the unsustainable growth of indebtedness across its state-owned firms in its latest check-up of the country’s economy. While the fund said the debt level is still manageable, corporate debt now sits at 145% of GDP and is growing twice as fast.

“The deviation of credit growth from its trend, a key cross-country indicator of a potential crisis, has reached 20-25% of GDP – very high by international comparison,” the fund stated in its report. The fund stressed that China needs to loosen its unsustainably high growth targets and tighten up its budget constraints, especially on State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and local authorities.

It said reducing the access to credit of weak firms is not only critical for addressing the existing debt overhang, but also to improving the efficiency of new credit allocation. Firms servicing viable debts should be restructured, while those that are not viable should be liquidated, it continued. “Continued support of fundamentally non-viable firms will only result in greater losses.” Highly indebted ‘zombie’ companies in particular should be targeted, it said, starting with those in “dynamic regions” whose workers would be able to find new jobs relatively easily.

If China’s economy does implode that will send shock waves though the world’s economies, and off course the property sector will not be spared.

Furthermore, on the back of concerns of a housing market bubble spurred by cashed up foreign investors snapping up properties, and following on from the Australian Government’s tinkering to foreign investment rules, recent statistics show that some Chinese investors are not settling on off the plan purchasers due to a number of factors including local instability and nervousness. This coupled with a potential correction to the world’s second largest economy would potentially spell disaster for Australia.

But all is not doom and gloom.

Chinese authorities recognise these risks and have often expressed concern about the build-up in leverage. and have proposed a wide sweep of financial reforms and other actions needed to address the growing vulnerabilities.
This is just an opinion piece so there is no need to panic but we must learn from history. We know that everything has a Life cycle: The property cycle, Share market cycle, Economic cycle. As is the case in Nature, when there is an imbalance in the ecosystem, there is always a correction to bring things back to equilibrium.
It has been 8 years since the GFC, and longer still for China’s unprecedented growth rate and rising debt levels. Which begs the question, what is China’s Life Cycle – when is it due for a correction?

"There is some prep work you need to do to ensure that your first foray will set you up strongly so you can continue to grow your portfolio.

Nila Sweeney, managing editor of PropertyMarketInsider.com.au reveals few tips to help you start your property journey with a bang.

1. Know why you're investing in property

Get clear about your reasons for choosing to invest in property instead of other asset classes such as shares.

Most investors know why they want to invest in property but some do it for the wrong reasons, such as trying to keep up with their neighbours or friends who are investing.

Property investing is not a competition. To buy an investment property just to trump a friend or have something to brag about is not wise.

2. Understand the risks of investing in property

Just because prices have been growing consistently for a number of years doesn't mean they'll go on indefinitely.

The truth is, growth in value is rarely consistent and linear. Some years you get growth spurts. Other times it's stuck in the mud. In short, capital growth is hard to predict.

You could also face vacancies or tenants that default and destroy your property. While there are ways to reduce these risks, they remain a part of investing in property.

If the area is in high demand, discounts are virtually non-existent as vendors know they could get the price they want.

3. Be prepared to stick it out over the long term

Even if you bought in the right area and picked the right property, there's no guarantee that you'd see growth quickly.

While some areas may experience rare short-term surges, the majority of suburbs go through periods of slow to no growth before values rise.

Therefore, be prepared to hold your property for at least one cycle (around 7 years) if you want to make a solid gain.

This means ensuring you have a solid cash flow to maintain your property to avoid selling prematurely.

4. Learn everything you can

While you're building your deposit, learn everything you can about property investing. Buy a few books from a range of authors to get a variety of opinions. Once you start hearing the same things over and over, you know you're ready.

""Be cautious of expensive courses with 'high hope' marketing tactics,"" warns Jeremy Sheppard, creator of DSRdata.com.au. ""Whatever you can learn in a weekend course is not worth thousands of dollars.""

5. Get your finances sorted ASAP

Create a budget so you live well within your means. However, make sure your investment doesn't stretch you too far.

""Remember that property investing is a long-term game. Don't plan to tough it out for the first year, because that first year might stretch out to five,"" says Sheppard.

6. Start with buy and hold

Capital growth is the ant's pants of property investing. It's also the easiest strategy if you know what to look for.

""Start off with this basic strategy,"" advises Sheppard. ""Once you can nail this, you may never need any other strategy. But even if you stretch into others, they'll all benefit from having underlying growth.""

7. Identify vested interests

The most noise in the property investment industry comes from people trying to sell you something.

Not all of them are sinister. You’ll find plenty of well-meaning individuals who are simply badly mistaken.

Each council website is different, but most will have a page where you can view development applications.

""You won't know who to believe sometimes. But if you can recognise when someone has something to gain by the conclusions they can get you to draw, then that's a good start to protecting yourself,"" says Sheppard.

8. Buy the best property country-wide

Plan to buy outside your own backyard. Plan to jump on a plane one weekend and go wherever the best property market is that fits your budget.

""You must learn how to read a property market from its supply and demand qualities, not from your past experience with the neighbourhood,"" says Sheppard.

9. Buy existing properties

As a general rule, don't buy new. New properties come at a premium and like driving a car out of the showroom, can drop in value soon after purchase.

10. Target character houses

If you can get an old period or character house, they usually make great long-term investments. But make sure it is in good condition.

11. Get close to the CBD

The closer to the CBD, the more convenient the property will be for tenants. Proximity to amenities that cities provide is a huge demand drawcard.

12. Development potential

Aim for a decent block of land that at least allows for a duplex to be built at some point in the distant future. A 300 square metre block is way too small - look for 550 square metres or more.

13. Get your head around supply and demand

Prices rise when demand exceeds supply. You want the highest demand to supply ratio (DSR). Sheppard points out that all your research for growth markets should be based on this philosophy. All your interpretation of data should be aimed at gauging supply and demand.

The bottom line

If you start early enough, you can make a number of mistakes and still end up not needing a pension at retirement age. That's the magical thing about compound growth.

""Property investing is one of the surest ways to set yourself up for early retirement. You'll never be a billionaire, but you only need to be a millionaire anyway,"" says Sheppard.

"While property is one of the safest assets you can invest in, it’s not without risks. Your job is to minimise it if you can’t eliminate it altogether. To help you avoid losing money and maximise your property profits, Property Market Insider spoke to creator of DSRdata.com.au Jeremy Sheppard for his time-tested and proven strategies.

The easiest ways to lose money investing in real estate

There are a number of ways to lose money when investing in property. Here are some of the ways you could get yourself in trouble very quickly.

Choosing poor growth locations
Selling too soon
Failing to accurately forecast income vs. expenses
Embarking on a bad project or completing it poorly

The typical scenario goes like this:

An investor buys in a bad growth location
There are more expenses than they anticipated
They grow impatient accruing losses each year
So they decide to sell before any growth happens
But they renovate first spending $20,000 which adds only $15,000

Sometimes it’s a good idea to sell and cut your losses, especially if you’re holding a heavy cash-flow killer or if you’ve picked a terrible growth location.

But other times, a little patience might make all the difference. You’re less likely to second-guess your decision if you get some good growth early on.

How to avoid losing money when you invest in property

There are plenty more mistakes to make. I’ve made heaps. But I pride myself on not making the same mistake more than about 3 or 4 times, 5 tops – OK call it half a dozen. Going forward I plan to only make new mistakes.

Here’s a list of some lessons I’ve learnt that might help you.

1. Try not to sell

As a general rule, buy and don’t sell. This reduces your capital gains tax liability and gives the most time for compound growth to do its thing.

However, keep your eye on markets you have bought in. If it is a regional market or a unit market, be prepared to sell if oversupply becomes a problem.

I bought three houses in one regional centre in QLD in 2004. They doubled in value in about three years. I refinanced to put the equity to good use elsewhere. But then there was a correction in the market, and I ended up with negative equity. I should’ve sold.

Regional and unit markets can offer great short-term flings but are not good long term options. City and house markets are generally better long term choices.

2. Research the tenant

If you buy a property from a landlord, don’t forget to research their current tenant. My first property came with a nightmare tenant. The owner was self-managing so they didn’t have access to a professional property manager’s blacklist database.

The tenant never paid a cent in rent, and it took more than 6 months to get them evicted. They were so disgruntled about being evicted for not paying rent, that they blocked all the drains and left the taps running causing over $10,000 worth of damage.

3. Show no mercy to late paying tenants

You may like to show some leniency to tenants who have fallen on hard times. Perhaps you’re a nice person. But your insurer is not. It may not be your choice to allow the tenant some more time, that decision may invalidate your insurance policy.

4. Don’t buy in markets you can’t get data for

If you can’t get sufficient data on a market, steer clear of it. Ignorance is a risk, you need to know, not guess.

I did some research on a town in New Zealand in 2006. It was hard getting all the right data, and I took an awful risk buying six houses in the one town. Luckily I was right, and prices doubled in a little over two and a half years.

But keeping an eye on that market was very difficult. I got lazy and assumed growth was simply trickling along. I asked my agent for a market appraisal years later and was alarmed to see how far prices had fallen back from their last high.

Access to good data on a regular basis would have made it easy to keep an eye on that market and make the right decisions at the right time. If I saw vacancies rising, I could ask the tenant to extend the lease well before expiry and for a much longer extension.

5. Leave sufficient cash reserves

Have about 2% of the value of the property available in reserve. This is to take care of unexpected costs. Some of these might be repairs and maintenance or rising interest rates.

I’ve had to ask the property manager to inform the tenant that a particular fix-up couldn’t be done just now. And it was simply because of a bad cash-flow moment I had. This coincided with the end of the tenant’s lease.

6. Don’t cross-collateralise

Cross collateralisation is where you offer multiple properties to the lender as security for the one loan. It’s a bad idea. If things go pear-shaped with finances or properties, you want choices of how to respond. Don’t give that choice to the bank.

Instead, to buy another property, get a “top-up” on the loan for the property that has the equity. Then get a second loan for the new property, possibly even get a second lender. Use the “top-up” from the first loan as the deposit for the second purchase. A good mortgage broker can go through all this with you.

7. Limit non-bank borrowing

The third tier, non-bank lenders may give you a better deal up front. But in times of trouble, like the GFC, you want a mainstream lender that will react predictably to the climate. Don’t wait for trouble to refinance. Once you’re in troubled times, refinancing is difficult.

During the GFC one of my non-bank lenders raised their interest rate to 11.5%. It was a 90% LVR. The property was owned in the name of a trust, and I was self-employed at the time. None of the mainstream banks wanted to touch it. I was almost forced to sell but toughed it out to better times.

8. Joint venture with a plan to exit

Don’t get into a joint venture without a clear written agreement between parties. And make sure the agreement has an exit, say within 5 years. Things change, people change - nothing lasts forever. Plan to exit. Only if things haven’t changed should there be an option to continue the arrangement, if both parties agree.

9. Avoid oversupply

The biggest killer to capital growth is supply. Every new property is a thorn in the side of capital growth. Developers are the enemy of investors. Avoid markets with oversupply or the potential for it.

Published 15 December, 2016.",2021_04_23,4-May-17,N/A,9 Ways to Avoid Losing Money on Your Investment Property
"Land Tax is a state impost and different states have different rules and thresholds – for every property investor it represents a significant cost to owning an investment property – but there are however smart ways you could use to legally minimise land tax with strategic tax planning advice from a specialist accountant.

I am not propagating that you should not pay the respective Land Tax for your property, because as a longer term investment the Capital Gains should outstrip the costs of holding this investment – including the Land Tax – however you should always consider the impact of Land Tax when acquiring your next investment property.

1. Purchase the property in the name of the person that may not already have used the respective threshold in a state.

For example, if the Husband already has a property in his name (excluding your Principal Place of Residence / PPOR) and has used up the threshold in that state, consider acquiring in the wife’s name to absorb a new threshold. However, be mindful of the tax implications if the property is negatively geared (please seek tax advice), not to mention any asset protection and estate planning risks and tax triggers associated with holding an investment in an individual name and passing it on to the next generation (again, do seek specialist advice).

2. Purchase an apartment that has lower land values that’s below the respective threshold for your state.

Apartment’s generally have a lower land component than houses therefore you should check the land component of the investment to determine whether you have reached the respective thresholds. You could own a number of apartment’s before hitting the thresholds in some states.

3. Use a separate Entity like a Fixed Trust or company that entitles you to a separate threshold on each property.

Some entities in various states are entitled to a separate threshold in their own right allowing you to have multiple thresholds. However before acquiring the investment in these structures seek independent tax advice as tax treatment could be different than acquiring in your own name and each state has different rules for entities. There may also be other tax implications and inflexibility regarding the use of these structures.

4. Consider the timing of sales and purchase on land and the Date of Assessment for Land Tax in a particular state.

For example, if you are selling a property, ensure that you settle prior to the Land Tax assessment anniversary. If you are selling property just be mindful that you may still be obliged to pay the Land Tax for the following year if you have not settled before this date. For instance, Land Tax in NSW has a peculiar anniversary date of 31st December – many clients are caught out when selling over this period by signing contracts but not settling until January and find that they have a Land Tax bill to pay even though the property has been sold.

5. ‘Don’t put your eggs in one basket’ – invest in property in several states.

If all properties were owned in the one state, let’s say NSW, you would normally exceed the Land Tax threshold. If however you spread your investment properties over a number of states then there would be less Land Tax to pay due to the fact that you have spread the land values over a number of thresholds.

Needless to say the first priority is to ensure that the Investment Property is the right one and ticks all the boxes. Land Tax is not the main consideration when buying your investment property but it is one potentially significant impost to holding your property long term and you need to have a Land Tax strategy of acquiring multiple properties. Always seek advice from a specialist property tax accountant who understands the complexity of Land Tax in different states.

"Although values have been increasing for almost 4.5 years, homes continue to sell quite rapidly with a relatively low level of discounting occurring from vendors.

The vendor discount and time on market metrics are important measures of current market conditions.  The vendor discounting metric looks at properties selling for less than their original list price and looks at the percentage difference from initial list price to ultimate sale price.  The time on market metric shows the average number of days between when a property is first listed and when it ultimately sells.  It’s important to note that each of these measures is based on private treaty sales and therefore excludes auctions.

In September 2016, the average days on market across the combined capital cities was recorded at 39 days.  At the same time a year earlier the average days on market was a slightly lower 36 days. 

Average days on market, 
combined capital cities

The second chart highlights the average days on market figure across each of the capital cities for each of the past 8 years in September.  Over recent years homes have been selling much quicker in Sydney and Melbourne than they have across the other capital cities.  Homes in Hobart and Canberra have seen fairly large falls in days on market over the past year which aligns with accelerating value growth.  In Perth and Darwin homes have seen a large rise in the average days on market as selling conditions have become tougher and values have declined.

Average days on market,
individual capital cities as at September 

In September 2016, the typical home which sold at a discount from its original listing price was discounted by -5.7% across the combined capital cities.  In comparison, at the same time a year earlier the typical level of discounting was recorded at -6.0%.  The lower level of discounting is reflective of more demand and fewer homes for sale but is also likely to reflect more realistic initial listing prices from vendors.

Average vendor discount,
combined capital cities

The final chart shows the discounting levels for each capital city in September over each of the past 8 years.  Once again Sydney and Melbourne, along with Canberra, have been seeing low levels of discounting by vendors over recent years.  In Sydney and Melbourne in particular this is indicative of strong housing demand which has led to many homes selling in excess of their initial list price.  Despite only moderate growth in values over recent years Canberra has consistently recorded low levels of discounting.  In Perth and Darwin as the housing market has wakened over recent years discounting levels have increased significantly.

Average vendor discount,
individual capital cities as at September

After combined capital city home values have been increasing for almost four and a half years (mainly in Sydney and Melbourne) the level of discounting and time on market remains extremely low.  This is being driven by ongoing strong housing demand coupled with relatively low stock levels.  While these conditions persist it is difficult to see how home values in Sydney and Melbourne in particular, won’t continue to increase.

"Researching a suitable location for your next investment can be a daunting process. There’s a lot to consider. Many investors don’t know where to start. Some become overwhelmed. Others cut corners while others simply couldn’t be bothered, to their detriment.

So how do you do your research effectively while covering all bases? Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Property Market Insider spoke to Jeremy Sheppard, creator of DSRdata.com.au to find out.

1. Understand what’s driving supply and demand in the area

Price growth happens when demand exceeds supply.

“There will be plenty of so-called experts that try to create extra categories to make their research appear more advanced. But there’s nothing else in it,” says Jeremy Sheppard, creator of DSRdata.com.au.

“All categories of research fall under one of those two main banners.”

Supply is easy to gauge, you simply look at what’s currently for sale, what is for rent and what is to be built in the future. You want as little supply as possible.

Demand is a little trickier. There are a number of stats you can look at to get a good gauge. This include:

Demand indicators to watch
Days on market

This is the number of days it will take for a property to sell once it’s advertised for sale. On average, it takes about 90 days to sell a property.

In a hot market, where demand outpaces supply, this number will be low as eager buyers snap up the available properties,” says Sheppard.

Vendor discounting

The discount rate indicates how willing vendors are to negotiate on price. In a slow market where demand is low, vendors might struggle to get buyers interested. In this case, they’re compelled to drop their asking price says Sheppard.

If the area is in high demand, discounts are virtually non-existent as vendors know they could get the price they want.

Vacancy rate

The vacancy rate is a measure of how many rental properties in a suburb are untenanted.

In a high-demand area, renters will be fighting for any available rental properties, and so this number will be very low according to Sheppard.

Rental yields and growth

A high demand location may also see rental yields rise as rents increase. When a location becomes attractive, renters are the first to make a move on it.

They increase demand for rental accommodation, and this places pressure on rents to go up.

Auction clearance rate

The ACR is the number of properties that sell as a percentage of those that go to auction. If there is strong demand for property and limited supply, buyers will bid the price up at auction.

With more sales, there will be a higher ACR. So a high ACR represents a high demand compared to supply.

Signs that prices may be on the verge of a growth spurt

These are some of the tell-tale signs that an area has started to to turn.

Properties are selling quickly as evidenced by low days on market
Increasing number of properties sold off-market
Vendors are reluctant to drop their asking price
More properties are sold via auction rather than via private treaty
Low number of properties available for sale
Limited number of properties available for rent
Rising rental yield despite growth in value
Dramatic rental growth recently
There are a large number of people searching for property
A lot of properties are sold via auction as opposed to private treaty
Properties are listed with open inspection times rather than appointment only
2. Use stats to shortlist

There are more than 35,000 suburbs in Australia. You only need to focus on a handful of areas, so use statistics to weed out all the “no chance” markets and to highlight the ones worthy of further research.

For example, if your budget is $375,000 you can immediately filter out more than 50% of property markets. You can also filter out those with high vacancy rates, low yields, too much stock on the market, etc.

3. Visit Council website

Visit the website of the Council presiding over the suburb in which you intend to buy. Check if there are any applications lodged by developers to add extra supply and ruin your capital growth chances.

Essentially, you’re looking for two things:

Future supply
Future demand

Each council website is different, but most will have a page where you can view development applications.

What to look for:
Check how many developments have been lodged for your target suburb.
Check the nature of the development and estimate the amount of supply it will create.
Check if there are planned or ongoing transport node developments in the suburb.
 New entertainment facilities
Community events
Local park improvements
4. What to do next?

Satellite imagery will tell you how much room there is for further development. If there are large tracts of land that are not nature reserves, then there is potential for new supply.

“Examine a map to find the best and worst spots. Look at satellite images as well as the street map. You may have to do a quick drive around too,” says Sheppard.

5. Avoid these newbie mistakes
Buying in regional areas, chasing higher yields
Buying cheap simply because it’s cheap
Buying units that suffer from oversupply problems and have little uniqueness
Buying new properties that come at a premium
Misunderstanding what truly drives growth
Limiting yourself to only local markets
Not starting by filtering out ordinary markets
Making decisions based on faith rather than fact
Mis-timing entry into the market
Failing to objectively consider risk

"Sydney & Melbourne have seen much stronger total returns than other capital cities over recent years. Recent data indicates returns in Hobart & Canberra are closing in on Sydney & Melbourne thanks to higher yields & accelerating capital growth.

The CoreLogic Home Value Index was released last week and it showed that combined capital city home values rose by 7.5% over the year to October 2016.  The most interesting recent development has been the accelerating annual growth trend evident within Sydney and Melbourne.  While the change in values is important, it only tells part of the story with the total return also an important figure to focus on.

Annual change in capital city home values,
to October 2016

While the home value index looks at changes in values, the CoreLogic Accumulation Index factors in the change in values over the year along with rental returns. As a result, the Index provides an indication of the total returns from residential property.

When you factor in gross rental returns, the total returns from residential property are actually positive across all capital cities.  This is despite values declining in both Perth and Darwin.  The total returns index also shows that Sydney and Melbourne are not quite so far out in front.  The strong value growth in these two cities is offset by record low yields.  Meanwhile, more moderate but accelerating value growth in Hobart and Canberra along with higher rental returns are resulting in total returns in these two cities closing the gap with Sydney and Melbourne.

Total returns from residential property,
12 months to October 2016

Looking at cumulative value growth over the five years to October 2016, Sydney and Melbourne stand head and shoulders above all other capital cities.   Over the five years to October 2016 Sydney home values have increased by 62.3% and Melbourne home values are 38.1% higher.  No other capital city has recorded cumulative growth of at least 20% over the past five years.

Total change in capital city home values,
5 years to October 2016

Total returns over the past five years indicate the property asset class has performed much better than if you just look at headline value growth.  Although Sydney and Melbourne have still recorded the strongest total returns over the past five years, returns in the other capital cities are much stronger once you factor in the rental return performance.

Total returns from residential property,
five year to October 2016

The strong value growth in Sydney and Melbourne over recent years has been a key driver of demand from the investment segment.  Over the past year, total returns have begun to accelerate in Hobart and Canberra.  Although value growth in these two cities has not been as strong as in Sydney and Melbourne, the superior rental returns are resulting in stronger total returns. 

With Sydney and Melbourne having seen much greater value growth than all other capital cities over recent years and rental returns pushing to lower level, the total returns on offer in Hobart and Canberra are likely to remain attractive for investors.  Particularly those investors looking for opportunities outside of the two largest capital cities.

"Each of the council areas that have recorded the greatest total value of sales over the past year have recorded a decline relative to a year ago.

The total value of transactions is an important figure to consider for real estate and mortgage professionals.  Because commission is typically calculated for real estate agents on the value of the sale and for mortgage providers based on the size of the loan, understanding where the value of transactions is greatest is valuable.  The following analysis looks at the value of sales across council areas; keep in mind that the size of the council region will have an impact.  We have only included regions that have had at least 50 settled sales in both 2015 and 2016.

Council areas with the highest value of sales,
12 months to Aug 2016

Brisbane has recorded the greatest total value of sales over the past year at $16.8 billion however, the value is -11.2% lower over the year.  The first table shows the total value of sales over the past year and the previous year for each of the 20 council areas nationally with the greatest value of sales.  Each of the top 20 regions listed have seen fewer overall sales and a lower total value of sales relative to 2015.

The second table shows the council regions that have seen the greatest increase in the overall value of sales over the past year.  Circular Head in Tasmania has seen a 91.6% increase in the value of sales over the past year.  Most of the regions listed have seen an increase in sales over the year, the exceptions have been Circular Head and Wakefield.  This suggests that the increase in value has been more driven by an increase in values of properties rather than an increase in turnover.

Council areas with the greatest increase in
value of sales, 12 months to Aug 2016

The final table highlights the council regions nationally that have recorded the greatest decline in the total value of sales over the past year.  Maranoa in Queensland has recorded then greatest decline in the total value of sales over the year, -48.1% lower.  In each of these regions except for Isaac in Queensland, the number of sales is lower over the year which is clearly contributing to the decline in value of sales.  A number of these regions are also linked to the mining and resources sector where home values have fallen substantially over recent years.  These factors are also contributing to the slide in the overall value of sales.

Council areas with the greatest decline in
value of sales, 12 months to Aug 2016

With the turnover of housing stock reducing across the country and fewer homes available for sale the amount of commission is reducing. One strategy that will help to alleviate this reduction in the commission pool is for industry participants to target those areas where turnover is increasing. Mortgage professionals will need to look more at opportunities in the refinance space, in Sydney and Melbourne in particular, these opportunities should be sufficient given the significant rise in housing equity over recent years.  Of course, another strategy to protect revenue is to improve market share.  Many businesses tend to tighten the purse strings for marketing and business development, however a contracting market offers up good opportunities to expand market share and increase productivity.

"The number of homes selling for at least $2 million has trended substantially higher over recent years which has largely been driven by the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets.

While a home selling for or in excess of $1 million was once the domain of the wealthy and indicative of the luxury housing market, sales of or in excess of $1 million are becoming much more regular.  Over recent years there has also been a substantial rise in sales of homes at or above $2 million however, they remain a much smaller proportion of overall sales than sales between $1 million and $2 million.  Perhaps $2 million is the new $1 million?

Over the 12 months to June 2016, there were 11,319 houses and units sold nationally for at least $2 million.  As the first chart shows, there has been some decline over recent months however, this could also be reflective of some transaction details having not yet come through.  Over the previous 12 months, there were 10,668 dwellings sold for at least $2 million, 10 years earlier there were 3,254 sales and 20 year earlier there were just 236 sales.

Annual number of dwellings sold for at least $2 million, National

Looking at the split between houses and units nationally, there were 9,882 houses and 1,437 units sold for at least $2 million over the past year.  As the chart shows, the number of units selling in excess for at least $2 million is still lower than its peak in late 2007.  It should be noted that the data is based on settled sales so does not include yet to settle off-the-plan unit sales.  Once settled, they will be included in the data at their contract date.

Annual number of houses and units sold for at least $2 million, National

The third chart highlights the number of sales of at least $2 million for New South Wales and Victoria versus the other states and territories.  The surge in sales at that price point has largely occurred in the two largest states.  In fact, in the other states and territories the number of sales of at least $2 million is still lower than the previous peak.

Number of house and unit sales  of at least $2 million,
NSW & Vic vs other states and territories

It is a similar story when looking at sales of or in excess of $2 million in Sydney and Melbourne compared to the other capital cities.  Sales at this price point have surged substantially higher across the two largest capital cities over recent years while they remain lower than their previous peak across the combined other capital cities.  Over the 12 months to June 2016, there were more units sold for at least $2 million in Sydney and Melbourne than houses sold above that price point across each of the other capital cities.

Syd & Mel vs other capital cities

Sales of properties at a price point above $2 million are becoming a much more regular occurrence in Sydney and Melbourne while they are much rarer elsewhere in the country.  This is just another example how the cost of housing in our two largest capital cities is detaching itself from the rest of the country.

"Using a buyer’s agent is a big expense and is not for everyone. So, when should you consider using one? Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Property Market Insider explains

With property prices soaring across the board, it’s getting harder to break into the property market as a homebuyer or an investor.

You have to save a deposit and then come up with additional cash to pay for buying costs such as stamp duty, legals, inspections and so on. This could leave you with little to pay for the services of a buyer’s agent.

So the question is, do you really need one?

When would you consider using a buyer’s agent
If you’re a beginner investor

If you’re a beginner investor, it can be overwhelming to learn all the different aspects of investing let alone choosing the right property to buy.

Having a property buyer to help you find the right property will help you avoid the costly mistake of buying a dud property.

If you lack time

If you don’t have the time to do all the ground work or are not interested in doing the research yourself, then it’s worth employing a buyer’s agent.

Some of the more intensive investigations such as researching the fundamentals of the area can be time consuming. Having a buyer’s agent do this for you could help you get into the market sooner.

It can be daunting and scary, but remember that you can always tap experienced professionals to help you. This will cost money, but it will also help you avoid costly mistakes that will come and bite you later on.

If you’re buying interstate

If you’re living interstate and want to diversify your investment to other areas, it’s not always feasible to travel to your target areas and it could get expensive very quickly.

Hiring a buyer’s agent to do the on-the-ground research for you could help you save time and money as well as ensuring you’re buying in the right location and getting the right property.

If you’re buying in a competitive market

A lot of investors want to stay away from areas where there’s intense competition among buyers. However, if you want to buy in a popular area and want to get ahead of the other buyers, it could be worth engaging a buyer’s agent to help you.

If you can afford it and want to get into the market as soon as possible

If you can afford the buyer’s agent’s fees and want to buy now, engaging a buyer’s agent could help you secure the right property sooner and before the market moves again.

If you’re not confident in your skills

It takes time to master all the nuances of property investing. It’s only after you’ve immersed yourself in the industry for many years and have been buying properties yourself that you’re able to distinguish a good buy versus a poor property.

By hiring a buyer’s agent, you could leverage their extensive experience and expertise to help you buy the best property for you.

The case against buyer’s agents
Hefty fee

The biggest downside of using a buyer’s agent is that they’re very expensive. Buying a property is expensive as it is without paying for someone else to help you source the property.

On average you’re paying about 2.5% of the property price, similar to what you pay a selling agent when selling.

If you’re buying a $500,000 property that’s $12,500 out of pocket already. For a lot of people, this is a lot of money to come up with upfront.

You pay a buyer’s agent fee each time you use them

The fact that you’ll be paying them this much every time you use them to secure your property would make it exceedingly expensive to build a large portfolio.

You could use the money to educate yourself

With the money you spend paying your buyer’s agent, you could use it to pay to get educated about property investing.

This is a skill that you can use over and over again in the future.

You still need to do your due diligence

Just because you use a buyer’s agent doesn’t mean that you don’t need to do anything. You still need to do your research to validate their suggestions.

This includes doing online research and visiting the property physically, which still takes time, money and effort.

It’s easier to do your research now

With so many resources available online, including this website, it’s now easier than ever to do your own research and get educated about property investing.

You have access to property reports just like the buyer’s agent and, with some education, you could learn how to spot a property with potential.

So, are buyer’s agents worth the money?

The short answer is yes. I’ve used both the full-service buyer’s agent and the property buyer’s group and got great results.

The properties I bought through both types did very well and continue to perform strongly. Engaging buyer’s agents when I did helped me get into the market before it took off.

I also bought properties by myself and these properties also are performing well above my expectations and are generating positive cash flow while achieving excellent capital growth.

While engaging a buyer’s agent may not necessarily save you money upfront as their fees are quite high, they do help you avoid making costly mistakes such as choosing a dud property.

What to do next?

There’s no question that navigating the property market is daunting if you’re starting out. But just like with everything, it gets easier the more you do it.

Getting educated is the first step.

Published:26 October, 2016.",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,Do you really need a buyer's agent?
"So, you’re thinking about starting a property portfolio but you don’t think you’re ready yet. Or maybe you think you don’t have what it takes to get started.

You’re not alone. Many aspiring property investors grapple with the same challenge.

Investing in property is a big commitment. It involves a lot of money. It involves taking a leap into the unknown. As such, it’s natural to make sure you’re prepared, both financially and emotionally. However, it’s also important to realise that you don’t have to have everything ready before you start.

If you’re waiting for everything to line up, you could be waiting for a very long time. You could end up missing out on a lot of great buying opportunities. Waiting for your ducks to line up, so to speak, could lead to you procrastinating and never taking action towards your goal.

So, what are the things you don’t need to get started now?
Credit Card

Some people will say, ‘go out and get a credit card or a car loan to build up a credit rating’, which you might have to do depending on your situation. However, don’t assume you have to, says Zoran Solano, senior buyer’s agent with Hot Property Buyer’s Agency.

“I personally got a mortgage before I got a credit card,” says Solano. “The reason I caution you about getting a credit card is because they affect your serviceability. Even if you have never maxed out your credit card, the lender will take into account the credit card limit you have and use it to calculate how much you can borrow.

“So, if you have a $5,000 limit, for example, this will reduce your borrowing capacity when being assessed by the banks. Therefore, where possible, reduce your credit card limits or cancel unused credit cards.”

Experience

Just because you haven’t bought a property before doesn’t mean you can’t get started now. The only way to get the experience is by actually doing it.

You won’t be able to buy property number two if you haven’t bought property number one.

You have to start where you are.

It can be daunting and scary, but remember that you can always tap experienced professionals to help you. This will cost money, but it will also help you avoid costly mistakes that will come and bite you later on.

“If you have the right team around you to guide you through finance, accounting, finding the right property and property management, you don’t need any experience, just the willingness to get into the market,” says Solano.

100% knowledge

While getting educated ensures that you’re not going in blind, Chris Gray, buyer’s agent and property expert, says you don’t need to know everything before you jump in.

“You don’t need to be an expert about property investing before you start,” says Gray. “You can certainly read up about the strategies and so on, but don’t wait until you think you know everything before starting up. You learn most things by actually doing them.”

Lots of money

It’s true that buying a property requires a bigger cash outlay than other assets, but you don’t need hundreds of thousands of dollars to get started. All you need is enough money to cover the deposit and buying costs such as stamp duty, legals, inspections and so on.

I’ve come across so many low to average income earners who have successfully built impressive portfolios during my time as the managing editor of Your Investment Property magazine. It’s not always how much you earn, but actually what you’re doing with that income that matters when it comes to lending.

As long as you can show the bank that you’re financially responsible, you can get a mortgage even on a low or average income.

100% confidence in the market

The reality is that no one can predict how the property markets will perform. There are factors that are beyond your control that could impact your investment. An element of risk is a part of investing no matter what asset class you choose.

“As long as you have enough cash to hold on for long enough, even if the market does go down, it should rise in the long term,” says Gray.

A trust structure

Having a trust structure basically means you’re able to maximise your tax benefits while protecting your assets. If you’re just starting out, you don’t have to concern yourself with setting this up.

Talk to your accountant first about the best structure for your portfolio, but don’t let this hold you back or cause you to procrastinate.

The essentials: What you must have to get started as an investor
A plan

You need to have a plan or investment strategy for each investment purchase you make, says Solano.

“Some purchases may involve adding value to create equity, or perhaps some will be for future potential development, or maybe even just a low maintenance set and forget property. But you need to work out how each property fits your overall strategy.”

Your big why

Getting clear about why you’re investing is crucial. “This is the biggest thing when you’re starting out because it’s what fuels you to take action,” says Gray.

Therefore, before you start doing anything else, you need to fully understand what’s driving you to invest in property. Is it for lifestyle? To quit your day job? To retire sooner and richer? Be clear about why you want to invest in property.

Basic budget

You need a clear understanding of how much you earn and how much you owe. This helps you to see whether you could afford to buy now or if you need to improve your cash position first.

Having a clear picture of your finances also enables you to see where you can cut back on your expenses to boost your cash flow.

Deposit

You do need to come up with at least 10% deposit to be able to get a loan. The size of your deposit depends on the amount you can borrow so work with your broker to determine how much you need.

There are many ways to gather the required deposit if you’re short on cash. Make sure you check with your mortgage broker first on what’s acceptable with the lender before you start asking your parents to stump up the deposit.

Buffer

Having enough of a cash buffer to tap into in case of emergency or if there’s a vacancy or change in your financial situation helps you sleep better at night.

Some investors have six months worth of mortgage repayments while others have up to three years. The amount you need depends on your situation and how much you think you need to be able to hold onto your property if the worst case scenario happens.

Mortgage broker

A good mortgage broker who’s used to dealing with investors and is an investor themselves is indispensable right from the start. You need them to help you figure out how much you can borrow based on your budget. They can also educate you about the different mortgage options and structures. They can also give you advice on how much deposit and cash buffer you need. If you don’t have enough saved, they can help you set up your savings goals.

Accountant

You also need to have an investor-focused accountant to help ensure that you’re maximising your tax benefits and your properties are structured correctly.

The cost of putting off your investment journey

Gray estimates that it’s costing you roughly $1,000–2,000 for every week you delay getting into the market. He explains: “If you bought a $500,000 property and it grows 5–10% a year, it could be growing anywhere between $25,000 and $50,000 a year, or $100,000 on a million-dollar property. 

“Even at a very conservative growth of say $50,000 a year, that’s about $1,000 a week growth that you’re missing out on. You need to start looking at your excuses and decide whether they’re worth giving up $1,000 for.”

"At the end of the June 2016 quarter, there were 212,036 houses and units under construction nationally, consisting of 61,350 houses and 150,686 units.  Over the quarter, the number of houses under construction fell -3.6% and there were -2.1% fewer units under construction.  Although the number of houses and units under construction is lower, on an historic basis they remain at exceptionally high levels.

Quarterly number of houses and units under construction, National

Looking at completion and commencement data shows that more dwellings were completed over the June 2016 quarter than were commenced.  Over the quarter there were 29,866 houses and 22,680 units commenced compared to 32,207 houses completed and 25,893 units completed.  The number of houses commenced rose 18.0% over the quarter while unit commencements were down -29.2% and at their lowest level since the December 2014 quarter.  In terms of quarterly completions, 32,207 houses and 25,893 units were completed representing quarterly increases of 39.2% and 71.3% respectively.  In fact, it was the highest number of unit completions on record over the quarter, 22.1% higher than the previous record high.  The data shows rising completions and given the large pipeline of dwellings under construction we should expect quite high volumes of completions over the coming quarters.

Quarterly dwelling commencements vs dwelling completions, National

At the end of the June 2016 quarter there was also a record-high number of dwellings which had been approved for construction but hadn’t yet commenced.  Nationally, 39,359 dwellings were approved but not commenced, up 15.6% from the previous quarter.  This is split between 9,185 houses and a record-high 29,713 units which had yet to commence.  Over the past few years there has been a steady upswing in the number of units approved for construction but not commenced and we anticipate that this trend will continue.

Focusing on state and territory data on houses and units under construction clearly shows where supply of new housing has ramped-up.

The 61,350 houses currently under construction were split between: 16,861 in NSW, 18,861 in Vic, 9,062 in Qld, 4,516 in SA, 9,826 in WA, 1,289 in Tas, 325 in NT and 611 in ACT.  The number of houses under construction was lower over the quarter in NSW, Vic, WA, Tas and NT and higher elsewhere.  In WA the number of houses under construction is at its lowest level since September 2012 and in NT they are at their lowest level since June 2013.

Quarterly number of houses under construction

The split across the states and territories for the 150,686 units under construction at the end of June 2016 was: 55,682 in NSW, 46,676 in Vic, 31,070 in Qld, 3,386 in SA, 8,396 in WA, 335 in Tas, 751 in NT and 4,390 in ACT.  Qld, SA and ACT were the only states and territories to have a greater number of units under construction over the quarter.  Qld currently has a record-high number of units under construction while in WA units under construction were at their lowest level since June 2014, in Tas they were at their lowest level since March 2014, in NT they were a their lowest level since September 2011 and in ACT they were at their highest level since September 2012.

Quarterly number of units under construction

Although commencements and the number of houses and units were lower over the June quarter they still remain at high levels on an historic basis.  There remains a significant supply of housing to be built over the coming years however, we anticipate that the trend towards a lower proportion of approved stock reaching commencement to continue to increase as a mature construction phase makes it more difficult for developers to achieve sufficient presales to progress to construction.  Furthermore, a number of these approved developments are probably being shopped for sale and therefore won’t necessarily be constructed during this current phase.

"Mining towns and regions across the country have been hard hit as investment and commodity prices have slumped.  This week we’re looking at how the housing market has performed in terms of the volume and median price of sales across these regions.  The results indicate that not all mining towns have recorded an equivalent slowdown.  The following analysis looks at annual median prices and annual sales volumes

Port Hedland – median prices peaked at $925,000 in June 2013 and sales volumes peaked at 402 in July 2006.  Current median prices are $390,000 (-58% lower than peak) and current sales are 128 (-68% below peak).  In what may be a positive sign for the market, annual sales are once again trending higher, although the median prices trend is yet to bottom out.

Isaac – median prices peaked at $620,000 in November 2012 and sales volumes peaked at 661 in March 2012.  Current median prices are $138,390 (-78% lower than peak) and current sales are 117 (-28% below peak).  Transaction numbers have recently started to rise, however median price trends remain negative.

Karratha – median prices peaked at $815,000 in October 2010 and sales volumes peaked at 511 in March 2005.  Current median prices are $362,980 (-55% lower than peak) and current sales are 235 (-54% below peak).  Transaction numbers have been trending higher but the median sale price is still falling, albeit at a more moderate pace.

Gladstone – median prices peaked at $475,000 in September 2012 and sales volumes peaked at 1,823 in July 2007.  Current median prices are $350,000 (-26% lower than peak) and current sales are 572 (-69% below peak).  Dwelling turnover is continuing along a downwards trend with no sign of an improvement in buyer demand just yet.

Kalgoorlie-Boulder – median prices peaked at $351,250 in June 2015 and sales volumes peaked at 1,656 in September 2006.  Current median prices are $312,000 (-11% lower than peak) and current sales are 345 (-79% below peak).  Transaction numbers appear to be levelling, however there is no sign of any upwards pressure on prices or turnover.

Mackay – median prices peaked at $435,000 in June 2013 and sales volumes peaked at 3,264 in April 2004.  Current median prices are $345,000 (-21% lower than peak) and current sales are 1,045 (-68% below peak).  Transaction numbers have recently levelled across the Mackay housing market but are yet to improve.

Roxby Downs – median prices peaked at $500,016 in November 2013 and sales volumes peaked at 187 in February 2004.  Current median prices are $250,000 (-50% lower than peak) and current sales are 23 (-88% below peak).  Transaction numbers have recently increased slightly across Roxby Downs.

The smaller mining townships which don’t act as major service centres have tended to see a much sharper fall in median selling prices than the larger townships.  The decline in sales and prices from the market peaks has been substantial across all of these regions, however the regions that have seen the most significant downturn were those that also recorded a significant upswing in prices and turnover rates prior to the peak in commodity prices.

Recently, most of these mining towns have experienced a stabilisation in sales with some regions having seen an increase in sales volumes.  Although sales may have broken the declining trend in a number of areas, median selling prices are generally continuing to trend lower across each of the regions highlighted. The improvement in transactional activity could potentially be due to larger numbers of distressed sales moving through these markets, but may also be attributable to a cautious return of buyers seeking out a bargain.

The challenge for many of these regions remains that despite a recent uptick in commodity prices, investment in large infrastructure projects (new mines, processing facilities, transport etc) has dried up and subsequently few additional jobs are being created.  Although commodity prices have recently surged, particular iron ore, coking coal and thermal coal, it is not yet leading to a substantial increase in exploration activity or employment, subsequently housing demand remains weak and continues to have a dampening effect on housing prices.

Published:9 November, 2016.",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,The Lowdown on the Mining Town Slowdown
"The popular myth in Australian real estate is that property prices double every seven to ten years. We test this myth, looking at the number of suburbs that have seen median selling prices double over the past decade.

A decade ago, the national median house price was recorded at $330,000 and the median unit price was $310,000.  Ten years later, the median selling prices were recorded at $499,000 and $445,000 respectively.  Based on these figures, selling prices nationally have increased by 51% for houses over the decade and by 44% for units.  Clearly, based on broad averages, in most areas of the country median prices have not doubled over the past decade.

Across the individual capital cities the results diverge significantly, however none of the capital cities have seen the city-wide median house or unit prices double over the past decade.  Prices have gone closest to doubling over the decade in Sydney, Melbourne and Darwin while in Perth and Hobart the total change for houses and units has been well below 50%.

Taking a more granular look at the housing market, there were 4,048 individual suburbs that had at least 10 house sales over the 12 months to both June 2006 and June 2016 and 1,665 suburbs that had at least 10 sales over both periods for units.  Of the 4,048 suburbs nationally for houses, only 573 suburbs or 14% have seen the median selling price of a house double over the past decade.  For units, only 159 of the 1,665 suburbs nationally, or 10%, have seen median prices of units double over the past decade.

The first table within the report shows the split of suburbs that have and haven’t seen median selling prices double over the past decade across each state and territory.  For houses; NSW, Vic and NT are the only states and territories in which more than 10% of suburbs have seen prices double over the past 10 years.  Looking at the unit markets, again only NSW, Vic and NT saw more than 10% of suburbs recording prices as doubling.  Not one suburb in Tas has seen the median prices double over the past decade.

Percentage change in median selling prices
June 2006  to June 2016

The second table provides an overview of the capital growth performance for capital city suburbs over the past decade.  For houses, Melbourne is the only city in which half of the individual suburbs have seen median selling prices double over the past decade while Sydney has also seen more than 40% of suburbs doubling in price.  Darwin is the only other capital city in which more than 10% of suburbs have seen selling prices of houses at least double over the past 10 years.  Across the unit market, once again Sydney, Melbourne and Darwin are the only capital cities in which selling prices have more than doubled in at least 10% of suburbs.

No. of suburbs where median selling prices have & haven't doubled
over the decade to Jun'16, by state and territory
No. of suburbs where median selling prices have & haven't doubled
over the decade to Jun'16, by capital city

Comparing tables 1 and 2 highlights how much stronger price growth has been in the capital cities than across regional markets.  It also highlights just how much the strong growth over the decade has been tilted towards Sydney, Melbourne and Darwin.  Of course, values are already declining in Darwin while they continue to rise in Sydney and Melbourne.

Remember that the next time you hear someone say that property prices double every seven to ten years that although it can happen in certain areas there are no guarantees.  The analysis highlights the importance of buying strategically; on average most properties have fallen well short of doubling their value over a decade.  This is highlighted by this data which shows far fewer owners have seen their real estate asset double in price over the past decade than those who have.  Those which have seen their property price double over the decade are most likely to be situated in Sydney, Melbourne or Darwin while in other capital cities and regional areas of the country the prospects of prices having doubled over this period are much lower.

"Buyer’s agents have come a long way since the days when only the monied investors employed them to source their property deals.

Nowadays, they’re as ubiquitous as Uber and for good reason.

Good buyer’s agents can help you get a great property deal even before it comes on the market.

Having a buyer’s agent on your side is particularly helpful in the current market where properties are selling fast.

Unfortunately, for an industry that’s already suffering from negative stereotypes such as ‘sharks’, ‘scammers’ or ‘dodgy’ operators, it continues to attract unsavoury characters. Which means that just like other experts in this industry, there are good and honest operators and there are those that you simply need to avoid.

So, how do you know you can trust your buyer’s agent to do the right thing for you? It starts by understanding the different types of operators in this space and how they work.

Buyer’s agents: Who should you choose?
Full-service buyer’s agents

These are buyer’s agents who offer full-service from start to finish. They source the property based on your requirements and will help you through settlement.

Pros

They offer tailor-made service for you, from sourcing the property all the way through  settlement
They handle all aspects of the property buying process such as researching the market based on your criteria, negotiating the price and securing the property
They help you prepare the paperwork and even help you organise the experts that you need such as lawyers, accountants or brokers
They save you time as you’re only presented with fully-vetted property options
They have access to property valuers and to any properties listed for sale

Cons

Their fees can be prohibitively expensive. They charge either a fixed fee of around $15,000 per property or a percentage of the property price, which can range from 1.5% to 3%

Selling point

They position themselves as offering the most comprehensive service to the buyer
They are generally well-connected and highly regarded in the industry
They generally have good track records and lots of experience
They are accredited by the industry bodies

What you need to know

When you enlist their services, you’re tied up. This means that if you pull out, generally, you have to pay a certain percentage of their fees, which can still be hefty
If you find a property on your own while using their service, they can still charge you the full fee for finding that property
You still need to do your due diligence on the property presented even if they’ve been researched. Only you know what works for you
Property buyer’s group

These property buyers operate differently to the full-service buyer’s agency in that they usually get a deal going and then offer their clients a chance to buy into it at a discount.

Unlike the full-service agency where they go and search the property based on your requirements, the property buyer’s group offers you the opportunity to buy into a property deal that they’ve already negotiated.

They call themselves buyer’s agents, but they’re technically just property marketers.

Pros

Ability to buy wholesale. You’re leveraging the property buyer’s ability to negotiate a deal that is often off-market and exclusive to them
Access to properties that are not available to the public
Generally charge lower fees (about 10–20% lower than full-service buyer’s agents)
Access to all the reports and experts, just like the full-service buyer’s agents

Cons

You’re limited to the property that’s being offered to you
You’re relying on the property buyer’s ability to negotiate and assess the property’s potential
You’re buying with other investors, potentially increasing competition
You might get pressured into making a quick decision. As these buyer’s agents have to move fast, you may not get enough time to do your own due diligence
The property may not be suitable for your situation and your goals

Selling point

They are cheaper than the full-service buyer’s agents
They have buying power, so they can buy wholesale

What you need to know

These agents go and source deals using their own criteria. They’re not generally tailored to your situation and goals
They may be targeting areas that are speculative or don’t have growth drivers
You may be asked to sign a contract quickly to guarantee a piece of the deal. As such, you may not have enough time to do your due diligence
Every now and then, you get offered properties that may look great on paper because of the negotiated lower price, however, lenders might not necessarily lend against it because of its location or the perceived risks
Generally, you need to pay them a non-refundable fee (around $1,000) to become a member of their group
Free service buyer’s agents

These buyer’s agents claim to give you free service for finding an investment property. However, they do charge homebuyers.

Pros

You get ‘free’ advice and service

Cons

It’s difficult to establish whether you’re getting independent advice on a property deal because you’re not paying them
They may have limited access to properties on the market if they’re splitting their commission with the selling agents

Selling points

They offer free service

What you need to know

Because you’re not paying for a service that generally attracts tens of thousands of dollars, you’re taking a leap of faith that you’re going to get independent advice and buy a solid property
When you’re not paying for a service, it’s generally because someone else is paying for it. As such, you may be offered a property that’s not suitable for you or worse, a substandard property that won’t grow in value
Property promoters

Property promoters are essentially marketing companies working for property developers. They generally have large stock of developments on their books for buyers to choose from. Their services are free to buyers because they get paid commission by the developers.

Pros

Access to a large number of developments
Free service to buyers
They’re generally transparent about the commissions they get from the developers

Cons

Because they’re paid for by the developers, they’re only able to offer you the property stock they have on their books
Mostly off-the-plan and new developments
They’re motivated by sales and less on the buyer’s needs

Selling point

They have access to an extensive array of property developments
Free service to buyers

What you need to know

Because these agents get high commission from the developers, they may try to sell you an unsuitable property for your situation and needs
You are limited to new properties or off-the-plan developments
The research they give you may not be independent
What service can you expect from a good buyer’s agent?

A good buyer’s agent is worth their weight in gold. Here are just some of the services you can expect to get:

Sits with you to understand your investment goals
Helps you create a realistic buyer’s brief based on your goals and financial capacity
Gives you comprehensive research analysis and comparable sales data
Extensively researches the market that matches your requirements
Shortlists properties for you to consider, highlighting both the positives and negatives of each option
Gives you advice on property prices in the area you’re interested in
Negotiates the lowest possible price for your chosen property
Negotiates the best terms in the contract such as the amount of deposit needed upfront, access to the property prior to settlement and so on
Works exclusively to help you get the best property at the best price
Rejects kickbacks or commissions from the vendor
Refers other professionals such as solicitors, property managers or brokers if you need them
Always keeps your information confidential
Maintains regular and honest communication with you
Helps you throughout the buying process
Beware: Are you dealing with a real buyer’s agent?

Broadly speaking, anyone who’s dealing with a buyer is a buyer’s agent. However, a buyer’s agent as defined by REBAA is anyone who’s working solely for the buyer.

They get paid for their services by the buyer. They don’t get remuneration or commission from someone else. Their focus is to source the best property for the buyer based on their requirements.

A selling agent can’t be a buyer’s agent because they work for the vendor. As such, their goal is to get the highest price for the property. As buyers, you can’t rely on them to give you unbiased information as they’re legally bound to get the best results for their client, which is the seller.

A property buyer’s agency that claims to work solely for the buyer but is paid by the selling agent, vendor or developers is not considered a buyer’s agent, according to Rich Harvey, president of REBAA and managing director with Property Buyer.

“Calling yourself an independent ‘buyer’s agent’ while selling property is simply dressing up the wolf in sheep’s clothing,” says Harvey. “True buyer’s agents have a fiduciary duty by law to act in the best interests of their clients and this is legislated in each individual state’s real estate law.”

"While doing extensive research helps ensure that you understand the market you’re buying into, it can also lead to analysis paralysis and missed opportunities. So, what’s the research sweet spot? Nila Sweeney, managing editor of Property Market Insider explains.

When it comes to research, how much is enough? It depends whom you ask.

Some experts say you should spend at least 3-4 months studying your target market. A well-worn advice is not to buy anything until you’ve inspected around 100 properties to get a solid understanding of the property value in the area.

While this is a sound guidance, Jeremy Sheppard, creator of DSRData.com.au says it doesn’t apply to all markets.

In fact, Sheppard believes that a large number of properties for sale in an area indicates a potential over-supply.

“I think suggesting buyers examine 100 properties before buying is rubbish,” says Sheppard. “I wouldn’t touch a market that had so many properties for sale. That should trigger alarm bells of over-supply.”

Sheppard says he’d pick markets with ideally somewhere between half a dozen to a few dozen properties for sale.

“I think visiting about 25 properties over the course of a month or so is more than enough for a single property market,” he says. That should give the investor a very good idea of what’s out there and what to pay for it. But in thinly traded, low supply markets, there might not even be 25 properties for sale – let alone a hundred.”

So, how long should you look for a property?

It’s all about adopting a Goldilocks approach according to Cate Bakos, founder of Cate Bakos Property.

“If you spend too much time researching, you’ll miss out. Too short and you won’t learn enough to make a sound decision,” Bakos says.

What this means is that your research should cover off the basics in detail, but nothing more.

The basics include:

Preferred budget range (the amount you can afford as determined by your broker/banker)
Suitable target areas
Best dwelling types for your criteria and budget
Land content required (must be within budget)
Proximity to public transport and other desirable amenities

Like Sheppard, Bakos doesn’t think you need to inspect 100 properties before you buy.

“Getting enough exposure to the latest sale properties and their results is crucial. Once you’ve seen some sale prices after inspecting a number of properties, you will start to determine values within your target dwelling types in your desired suburb.”

Bakos points out that taking a cross-section of property sales is important, not just relying on one spectacular bargain.

“Understanding the likely selling price, the type of buyers for that segment of the market, the areas which exhibit more fluctuation and the streets which attract the highest numbers of competing buyers is valuable. Once this intel is established, I’d consider THIS the sweet spot,” she says.

Doing this research phase thoroughly should only take weeks, not months according to Bakos.

“A buyer will know when a property is purchase-worthy. We say ‘three weeks to three months’ is normal. More than six months is not normal and hints that there are issues with either the strategy, the searching or the decision-making. The reality is, a researcher who over-analyses every result will always find a reason to cool their enthusiasm on a particular property or procrastinate making a decision. You need to remember that no property ever scores 100%. No property is perfect and all have their imperfections.”

Sheppard agrees and adds that you’d get all the market intel you need within 2-3 months.
“Professionals can get all their research done within a week. But I think even a month of research might be a bit too quick for a novice property investor. On the other side of the coin, if you’re not making offers within three months, you’ve probably got analysis paralysis or you’re using the wrong tools or have come across some conflicting advice or data,” says Sheppard.

The key is to pick the right suburb to start with

It’s an old adage but it still rings true. You’re better off buying the worst property in the best suburb than buying the best property in the worst suburb.

Once you’ve got the suburb right, it relieves a lot of pressure picking the right property.

You can quickly narrow down your target by shortlisting the areas you want to focus on. This topic is covered extensively in our article Chasing Hotspots.

In brief, you do this by using property indicators such as auction clearance rates, vacancy rates, rental yields, capital growth and so on.

There are a number of websites where you can get these suburb statistics including corelogic.com.au, onthehouse.com.au and propertyvalue.com.au.

“By using the statistics you can immediately eliminate over 99% of the ordinary markets around the country. I’d say about 80% of your success lies in that research alone,” says Sheppard.

Once you’ve done this, you can spend time digging deeper by looking into the areas more closely.

This is the really time-consuming part. Here is a quick estimate of how much time you’re likely to spend doing these research activities according to Sheppard:

Pondering over DAs lodged on council website pages shouldn’t take more than a few hours per property market. Checking satellite imagery should be even quicker.
Infrastructure projects might not show up anything, in which case it would be really quick to tick that off. But if there is a project to consider, then it could take many hours to acquire all the appropriate information and estimate how the project will affect supply and demand.
The manual research for a single suburb will typically only take a researcher half a day to complete. But given there are dozens of suburbs in your short list, it can take a few weeks for a part-timer to complete.
Property inspections only take 20 minutes.
Examining the property online, clearing your diary to attend the open inspection, travel time, making notes and reviewing photos takes hours. And you may not get the chance to examine properties Monday to Friday. So the elapsed time could be a few months for a handful of thinly traded markets.
Bottom line

If you haven’t made a move after six months, you have a problem. It’s either back to the drawing board for more options or summon more courage.

If on the other hand you’re planning to buy within the first month, you also have a problem. But in this case you’ll be better off running your plans past a conservative companion to balance your excitement with their composure.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia announced it will hold the official cash rate in October at 1.50%. The hold decision was the first handed down from the new Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Phillip Lowe. The decision came among concerns of weakness in the global banking sector, and signs of strength in the US economy.

The persistent strength of the AUD against the USD has factored into past RBA decisions this year. The RBA pursued a low cash rate in hopes it would de-value the Australian dollar, and keep export volumes buoyant.

In the September policy statement, former RBA governor Glenn Stevens suggested an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the return to more robust economic growth in Australia, and the AUD has indeed surged. The dollar is currently around US$0.77, above the average of US$0.76 over September.

The climb in the AUD may reflect OPEC’s successful negotiations in September to limit oil production – a decision that saw increases in many currencies that are tied to energy commodity exports. As there is still uncertainty around OPEC relations however, currency movements may be volatile for energy exporters. Furthermore, continued strength in the US economy may offset recent gains in the AUD. Therefore, the currency may have factored less in today’s rate decision than in previous months.

Today’s hold decision may also be in anticipation of new inflation data. June quarter inflation was at just 1% for the year; a 17 year low, and well below the cash rate target band of 2-3%. Q3 figures will be released towards the end of October.

The appointment of Lowe is significant, because the governor has indicated the RBA may take a more flexible approach to pursuing the inflation target band, suggesting stability in future cash rate decisions, and urgent rate cuts unnecessary to stimulate spending.

This is also likely to allow steady growth movements in the over-heated east coast housing markets. Onthehouse.com.au non-revised median value figures indicate that most major markets experienced a decline in dwelling values over August. The national aggregate showed median house values fell by 0.86% and unit values declined 0.87%.

Though the gradual moderation of dwelling prices may put deflationary pressures on the economy, other economic factors are gradually improving. Iron ore gained approximately 30% in value over the year, and Manufacturing PMI, released yesterday, revealed an increase to 49.8 in September, up from 46.9 last month.

Finally, a rate hold may be expected as the efficacy of continued rate cuts is challenged by bank performance. Globally, low interest rates have put banks in an awkward position of having lent at low interest rate returns, while simultaneously looking to pay higher rates for deposits in the future as the economy recovers.

This conundrum has contributed to a fall in Deutsche Bank profit and shares, creating economic instability in an already low growth environment. Furthermore, Australian banks are coming under scrutiny after not passing on full rate cuts in August. Maintaining the cash rate may facilitate greater financial stability in the coming months.

"There are so many costs associated with buying a property that it can be tempting to save a few hundred dollars by avoiding a pre-purchase pest inspection. 

But saving a modest amount on an inspection can end up costing many thousands of dollars down the track if it emerges the home has a pest problem. 

A pest inspection is designed to uncover defects such as termite activity, borer damage and decay. It can also identify risk factors for future problems, including poor sub-floor ventilation. 

Ideally, this type of inspection should be conducted together with a building inspection to assess the extent of any repairs required. 

Once a pest inspection has been carried out, it’s up to the would-be buyer to decide whether any problems identified are deal-breakers. For example, if the cost of repairs is likely to be more than they have budgeted, this could be enough reason to walk away from the sale. It’s not uncommon for termite damage to cost $7000 or more to fix. 

The pest report can also be used as a bargaining tool. If the sale is being conducted via private treaty, a would-be buyer can ask the vendor to prove that any faults outlined in the report have been remediated before agreeing to buy.  

In a hot real estate market, time is of the essence. Where competition is driving a quick sale, the buyer can seek to include a clause in the contract making the purchase conditional upon the vendor fixing the problem. A lawyer can help with the wording to ensure it provides adequate protection. 

A serious pest problem might even be a blessing in disguise if the buyer plans to knock down all or part of the property and renovate or rebuild. In this case, they could try to negotiate a significant discount to the asking price – even though they have no intention of repairing the existing building. 

The typical cost of a pest inspection – usually around $200 to $300 – is money well spent if it leads to thousands of dollars being knocked off the original asking price. 

For properties going to auction, it is especially important to ensure any building and pest inspections are conducted before auction day, as no cooling-off period applies.  

When considering purchasing an apartment, a good first step is to inspect strata records. This could reveal whether any pest inspections have been conducted recently, the extent of any damage identified, what remediation has been undertaken or planned and estimated costs.  

Relying on strata records, however, is no guarantee against existing faults. Apartment buyers who want peace of mind should commission an independent report.  

A pre-purchase pest inspection can also be used as the basis of an ongoing management plan if the sale goes ahead despite issues identified in the report. 

The Australian Pest Control Association recommends choosing a reputable company with professional indemnity and public liability insurance. Ensure the inspector has a current pest control licence and be wary of gimmicks such as 10-year guarantees, which could involve committing to pay for regular inspections you might not want.  

For more advice, see the association’s consumer advice page here or go to www.propertyregister.com.au to see if the property you are interested in has already had an inspection.

"Market Update

Overall capital growth in median value houses across Australia was 3.98% over the three months ending July, which was largely driven by strong growth in the metropolitan and regional markets in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. Hobart houses also performed well with an increase of 1.05% in the July quarter, however regional Tasmania suffered a sharp decline of 3.18%. Table 1 shows the latest Residex data to the month of July.

Table 1: July 2016 Summary

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

July saw even stronger performance in Australian units, as the median value increased 4.78%. Again, growth was largely driven by increases in New South Wales and Victoria.

The July statistics reflect analysis in previous months arguing the boom in Sydney is quickly easing. While quarterly growth in Sydney houses was strong, annual growth is at just 3.95%, the lowest annual growth rate since May 2013.

Simplified performance of the respective capital city dwelling markets can be seen when looking at a dwelling value index over the last 5 years. Using the median dwelling value for each of the capital city metropolitan regions, Graph 1 shows the respective performance of these cities over the last boom period by starting the index from July 2011. At each year following, the index represents by what factor the median dwelling has gone up by. In this case, the median Sydney dwelling is now approximately 1.5 times, or 150%, what it was worth 5 years ago.

The graph highlights that this enormous upswing in Sydney has led to milder increases in the other capital city markets, with the exception of Peth and Darwin following the end of the mining boom. While recent capital growth has been strong in Melbourne, Hobart and the ACT, Graph 1 shows that this growth comes off the back of losses in 2011, which partially accounts for the growth disparity between Sydney and the other south

Strong Rent Gains in Hobart Houses

The July statistics also reflect that rents are adjusting to increased growth and popularity in the south-east markets, which have recently benefitted from a spill-over of growth from Sydney. These markets are the ACT, parts of Tasmania, and country New South Wales.

Hobart houses saw the largest increase in dollar value rents for the year, of 8.57%. It is important to note that aside from Western Australia, Hobart houses also had the lowest rents of all capital city house markets, so slight increases in rent present as strong growth rates. Graph 2 shows the movement of capital growth of houses and rent in Hobart growth becoming more aligned.

Hobart house market and Australia wide house market rent growth is compared in Graph 3. Hobart rents have historically shown more volatility in growth than Australia wide rents. The last two years have also seen a distinct divergence between growth in Australia-wide and Hobart rents.

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

In any case, these smaller markets such as Hobart and the ACT have historically followed the Sydney market at a lag. While some property markets in Australia are yielding low returns at their peak growth relative to Sydney and Melbourne, they are still strong relative to bonds, cash and stocks. In the current economic context, in which low growth rates are the ‘new normal’ in so many sectors, Australian assets and property become attractive.

Economic Update

Australia recently received an affirmed AAA credit rating from Moody’s, based on a GDP outlook of 2.7% growth for this financial year, despite the mining boom coming to an end more than four years ago when commodity prices peaked. In fact, while some housing markets have been correcting following the mining boom, there have been some bright spots in Australian commodity exports. Coal increased to an astonishing $90 per dry metric tonne in July, up from an average of $77 over the previous month. Liquefied natural gas projects are also moving into production, however the revenue and tax earnings from Australian LNG may not be as promising as first thought due to Australia contributing to a supply glut.

Standard and Poor’s has put Australia’s credit rating on negative watch due to a persistent budget deficit, and concerns that reliance on foreign capital exposes the Australian economy to risk.  The Australian economy is performing well when compared with other OECD countries today, which is likely to attract further overseas capital. However, anyone comparing Australian indicators with their own history would see that current growth and jobs figures are weak.

Unemployment in Australia dropped to 5.7% in July from 5.8% in the previous month. However, growth in employment figures was driven by part-time employment. This is likely to keep wage inflation subdued, which may prompt a further rate cut this year. Australia’s part time employment rate was at a record high of over 30% at July 2016.

Assuming relatively strong returns in housing markets will continue to attract foreign investment in the short term, pressure will be on the Australian currency. This is because foreign investors buy assets with Australian dollars, driving demand for the AUD. This helps to create the appearance of growth, while putting pressure on the RBA to cut rates in order to bring down the dollar.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia announced it will hold the official cash rate in September at the historically low rate of 1.50%.

The decline of rates throughout 2016 may be partly attributed to the stubborn Australian dollar, which hovered around US$0.76 for most of July and August. The RBA have used subtle language and interest rate cuts in an attempt to de-value the Australian currency over the year.

A lower Australian dollar increases competitiveness of Australian goods. It also increases general prices through imported inflation, lifting the price of imported inputs for Australian goods and services. The annual inflation rate of just 1% to June in Australia looks set to remain low, at least over the remainder of the year.  

Despite the best efforts of the RBA, the AUD continued to climb gradually since May, which partially contributed to the August cut. The persistently high AUD made a case for further rate cuts.

That was, until, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen spoke at a symposium on the 26th of August.

Yellen argued that strengthening in the US labour force meant “the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months”. The speech was followed by comments from the Vice Chair Stanley Fischer, who indicated that US rates could rise as soon as September.

This hint at higher interest rates saw a boost to the USD, and a complementary weakening in the AUD. Graph 1 shows the movement of the AUD relative to the USD over August. This took pressure off the RBA to use monetary policy as a means to lower the dollar, and may have contributed to the hold decision this month.

Graph 1: AUD/USD-August 2016

Source: RBA & Trading Economics

The next Fed rate decision is September 22nd, and an increase is likely to place further downwards pressure on the AUD and potentially create room for the RBA to delay further rate cuts.

This is important, because residential property value growth and dwelling approvals in Sydney and Melbourne have continued to be reactive to rate cuts earlier this year. Across Australia, dwelling construction saw a 1.2% increase over the June quarter, and a strong 6% increase over the year. Meanwhile, other sectors of construction work fell dramatically: engineering work fell by 9% in the quarter, and private construction fell by 14% over the period. 

Building approvals were up across Australia in July, as the number of units approved increased 4.97% year on year. However, across the country the number of separate houses approved fell by 3.19%. Much of the growth in dwelling approvals for the year was driven by the Sydney and Melbourne markets. This was expected following a May rate cut as more dwelling development projects gain cost benefit. A hold in rates is likely to see the market steady.  

Graph 2: Trend Data - Residential Dwelling Approvals Australia Wide

Source: RBA & Onthehouse.com.au

Graph 3: Trend Data - Total Residential Dwelling Approvals by Capital City

Source: RBA & Onthehouse.com.au

The number of dwelling approvals across Australia over time is shown in Graph 2. While 2012-15 saw a steep increase in the number of dwelling approvals, another small upward trend can be seen over 2016. Graph 3 shows the original monthly data of total dwelling approvals by capital city (which is volatile relative to the trend data), with Sydney and Melbourne experiencing a significant surge.

The movements in dwelling approval data is expected, as it follows capital growth in the dwelling market. Following the May rate cut, Residex observed strong growth in Sydney and Melbourne dwellings for the June quarter, including a 1.85% surge in Sydney units, and 2.29% in Melbourne units.

The RBA faces a two-tiered economy in which housing has boosted growth in the south-east coast of Australia, while growth in other cities across Australia is subdued. Part time employment in Australia also reached a record high of 31.63% in July, suggesting ongoing structural challenges in full time job creation and wage growth. As the rate is held for September, we may expect these east coast markets to steady a little, and growth in approvals start to flatten.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will cut the official cash rate by 25 basis points in August, to a historically low 1.50%.

The decision comes off the back of the weak growth in the United States reported last Friday, extremely low inflation in Australia and a perceived stabilising in the Melbourne and Sydney property markets.

Economic data coming out of the US shows much slower than expected GDP growth in June. Annual GDP growth in the US economy was just 1.2% in June, which is well below its forecast of 2.6%. The weakened confidence in the US economy has cast doubt on future cash rate increases by the US Federal Reserve and subsequently the USD fell sharply.

Typically, when the USD goes down the AUD goes up. The inverted relationship is demonstrated in Graph 1.

Graph 1: Movement in the AUD vs USD

Source: RBA & Trading Economics

In the past, the RBA has referenced a high AUD as being threatening to prosperity in exports and potentially stunting GDP growth more widely. With inflation at just 1% in the year to June, there is also an added incentive to keep the currency down so overseas goods become more expensive and create ‘imported inflation’.

Monetary policy is increasingly being used as a tool to lower the AUD. If the interest rate (or return on the dollar) is low, investors are likely to sell off the Australian dollar creating an oversupply of the currency – thus devaluing it.

Inflation is another persistent pressure that may have led to today’s cut decision (annual inflation is 1%). Though the RBA can ease monetary policy to stimulate spending, the rate cut will be limited in creating demand across the economy without complementary fiscal policy from the government.

Rate cuts appear to have previously stimulated spending in the Sydney and Melbourne property markets, with investment also spilling over to regional NSW, Tasmania and parts of Queensland.

The graph reveals that while rate cuts have not had an immediate impact on annual growth, a succession of rate cuts appear to be followed by higher rates of annual growth in these markets.

In the shorter term, the data is indicating a rebound in the Sydney house market, with the median house value increasing 2.94% over the June quarter. Sydney unit growth was also strong at 1.85%, while Melbourne houses and units recorded growth in values of 2.37% and 2.29% respectively over the June quarter.

The new financial year may have also contributed to the surge in property prices in June. As banks have had to limit investor mortgage portfolio growth to 10% per year, the new financial year may have allowed new investors to secure loans.

Other economic indicators have been mixed. The seasonally adjusted unemployment and participation rates both increased by 0.1 percentage point in June, to 5.8% and 64.9% respectively.

Business confidence in Australia increased significantly in June, though consumer confidence fell below 100 in July indicating pessimism about income, employment and spending among households. The Australian stock market has trended steadily upwards in July, largely unaffected by recent uncertain events such as the Brexit and the federal election.

Given the relative stability of the Australian economy in the post Brexit shock, and the impact that continued rate cuts can have on Sydney and Melbourne property prices, it is unlikely that a further rate cut will follow in September. Monetary policy has been limited in improving inflation or maintaining a low AUD.

"Market Update

Overall, the Australian property market performed well in the June quarter. Table 1 presents the statistical summary for June.

Table 1: June 2016 Summary

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane achieved strong gains in the June quarter, with the exception of Brisbane units which remained virtually unchanged.

Sydney houses achieved strong growth of almost 3% in the June quarter – largely driven by capital gains in June. Growth in the year to June was also strong – at 8.02% (or a value increase of $55,000) – however this annual growth rate is down from its peak annual growth of 21.95% in September 2015 when the median Sydney house increased by $172,000. Growth in the Sydney market may ease further as dollar weekly rentals are stagnating in units and falling in houses.

A similar surge in the June quarter occurred in Brisbane houses, which had the strongest quarterly capital growth rate at 2.95%.

Quarterly growth in the Hobart house market has begun to subside, with values falling 1.34% over the June quarter.

The resource markets in WA and NT have continued to decline, however the pace of the reductions has slowed.

In Darwin, median values dropped 5.16% and 6.23% in the year to June, in the house and unit markets respectively. Graph 1 shows quarterly growth rates in Darwin.

Graph 1: Quarterly Growth in Darwin Houses & Units

The data suggests that the pace of losses have started to ease as the dwelling growth cycle may have entered a cyclical trough. There was a cyclical trough in growth reached in early 2011 and again in early 2016. The growth patterns show that a trough does not signify the end of a downward trend in these dwellings. With completion of the Ichthys project expected in early 2017, as well as ongoing declines in rental rates and transaction numbers, it is uncertain whether this market has fully corrected. In the short term, growth may come into a cyclical upswing, though this is somewhat dependent on the amount of investment and interest in the Northern Territory.

Australia wide, the median house increased in value by a modest 0.03% during the June quarter, while the median Australian unit increased by 2.58%. However, the strong growth in the unit market follows a 1% decline in the previous quarter. Graph 1 presents quarterly growth of Australian houses and units over the last 10 years.

Graph 2: Quarterly Growth in Australian Houses & Units

 

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

Recent divergence between the performances of the different dwelling types may be partially explained by the growth cycles of houses and units being unsynchronised. Looking at the graph, you can see that the unit market appears to have led the house market in the upswing of 2009 and again in 2012-2013.

As property has become increasingly used for investment purposes, and units become popular amongst investors, unit investment from speculators may provide first movement in the market. This early signal may then flow through to other segments of the market, adding to momentum and overall demand.

Other explanations for the divergence may be the relative affordability of units, or units becoming an increasingly preferred dwelling for locations in cities.

Housing and an Ageing Population

The Eastern seaboard markets have performed counter-cyclically to growth in wages and GDP, both of which are trending below the historical average. When wages are low but growth in housing is high, the credit used to fund this growth in housing is found elsewhere.

Reportedly, an increased number of Australians coming into retirement have used money in a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) to take out a loan for property. The new normal of low economic growth and low yields from most assets makes east-coast property an economic anomaly.

Graph 3 presents the latest data from the Australian Taxation Office on SMSFs.

Graph 3: Percentage of Real Estate Assets in SMSFs vs No. SMSFs

 

Source: ATO, SMSF Statistical Report September 2015

The graph plots the number of SMSFs and the asset allocation to property, at each quarter over the last 5 years. Without a longer time series, it is difficult to say whether residential property has made up an increasing percentage of retirement portfolios. However, the increase of SMSFs with a fairly consistent rate of allocation to residential real estate suggests this could be one source of growth in the Australian housing market.

From the March to September quarter of 2015, there was an increase of allocation to residential property from SMSFs, of 0.43%. This was a time when the Sydney market was coming into its peak growth rates for this cycle.

Interestingly, the same period saw a higher increase in the share of commercial property that composed SMSFs assets. This could be because the ATO sometimes permits the purchase of business premises for fund members to operate in. Commercial property also presents a favourable tax environment, with a capital gains tax of just 10% if the property is held for over 12 months.  

These trends are important to note as they highlight the sources of demand outside of Australian wages and employment. When there are multiple sources of demand flowing into a locally supplied market, property prices could be affected by the current regulatory uncertainty around superannuation.

It is also important to note that the oldest baby boomers in Australia are now at retirement age. The property purchased through SMSFs will one day need to be liquidated in order to supplement pension income and address extremely high health and aged care costs. If a large number of stock is to be liquidated at once, this could erode some value in the properties owned by retirees, unless offset by an increased population.

Across the nation, median house values fell by 0.86% in August and unit values declined by a very similar 0.87%. While most regions have recorded a decline in median values in August, it is quite a different picture over the past 12 months.

Median house values have increased over the 12 months to August 2016 in most regions of the country and are 6.58% higher nationally. In comparison, seven of the 16 regions published in Table 1 have recorded a fall in median unit value over the past year. Nationally, median unit values have increased by 2.91% which is less than half the rate of growth of in house values.

When we look at the median house and median unit data over time, it shows that house and unit values are now below their peak in all regions. The magnitude of these declines varies significantly on a region-by-region basis as well as across different property types.

Graph 1 below highlights the magnitude of decline in median house values from the respective market peaks across the capital cities and nationally.

Across the country, median house values are 0.9% lower than their previous peak. In terms of the greatest declines from peak, they have predictably occurred in the regions which have the greatest exposure to the resources sector. Regional Western Australia has been hardest hit with median house values 22.6% lower than they were at their peak. Perth, Darwin and Regional Northern Territory house values have also recorded substantially falls from their respective peaks, down 8.8%, 9.5% and 7.9% respectively.

In all other regions analysed, the decline since the market peak has been less than 5%.

The results show a similar picture to what has unravelled for housing, with those regions linked closest to the resources sector having recorded the greatest value declines. At a national level, median unit values are currently 0.9% lower than their peak which is an equivalent decline to that recorded for houses. The regions with the largest overall declines in median unit values have been: Regional Western Australia (15.1%), Regional Northern Territory (14.1%), Darwin (13.7%), Perth (11.3%) and Regional South Australia (8.4%).

Across most regions of the country median house values have recorded more moderate overall declines than units however, there have been a handful of exceptions. In Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Regional Western Australia, the overall decline in median house values have been greater than median unit value declines.

Economic Overview

The National Accounts for the June 2016 quarter have been released over the past month. The national accounts showed that over the quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) which is a measure of the economic output of the country, increased by 0.5%. As a result, GDP increased by 3.3% over the 12 months to June 2016. Although headline GDP was quite strong, GDP per capita, which measure output per person, increased by a much lower 2.0%.

The latest unemployment data showed that in August 2016, the national unemployment rate was recorded at 5.6% which was its lowest reading since July 2013. While at a headline level it looks like an encouraging read, the lower unemployment rate did hide some additional indicators of concern for the labour market. While the number of employed persons has increased by 1.6% over the past year, full-time employment has increased by just 0.4% compared to a 4.1% increase in part-time employment. The heightened growth in part-time employment wouldn’t necessarily be of concern if employees were happy to be working part-time, the quarterly data on labour force underutilisation shows that 14.3% of employees were underutilised. What this means is that 14.3% of the labour force are willing and able to work more hours than they are currently. The rate of labour underutilisation is at close to a record-high level.

"A good property manager is worth their weight in gold. So how do you pick the best person to manage your property? 

There’s no doubt that a property manager could make or break your investment. Hiring a poorly chosen manager could result in hefty losses in terms of missed rental payments and a mismanaged property.

Therefore, it’s important to conduct extensive due diligence on your potential property manager before you appoint them to look after your biggest investment.

During your research, the things you need to look at include their knowledge of the area and market rental values, feedback from their clients, and their full services and costs. Most importantly, they should be able to show a good working history regarding managing a rental property and its tenants.

To help you make the right choice, here are some steps you may want to consider when selecting your property manager...

1. Check out the local players first

A local property manager has the distinct advantage of being familiar with the local rental market as well as the renters in the area. They can also access your property quickly if necessary.

A quick Google search should show you which agents are operating in your area.

2. Check their qualifications

A property manager must be a licensed real estate agent in your state or territory.

You can easily check their qualifications by contacting the Fair Trading department in your state or territory, or by simply asking them to show it to you.

3. Get references from other landlords

A quick way to find a good property manager is to ask other successful investors who they use or recommend.

Your potential manager should also be able to give you contact details of clients (current or former) who can vouch for their service.

If another landlord referred you to a prospective manager, ask the following probing questions:

How long have you used this property manager? 
Why did you choose this property manager?
How often do you get updates and progress reports?
Have you ever had any problems with the tenants your property manager has recommended?
Have you ever had any issues with the property manager?
What do you like about this property manager and the agency they work for?

4. Ask them about their past experiences

Asking the following questions will give you a good idea about their experience as a property manager. Their answers should match up the responses from their references.

How long have you been working as a property manager?
Have you ever had disputes with tenants or landlord clients? If so, what were the issues and how did you resolve them?
How would you deal with rental arrears, repairs and maintenance?
How often would you inspect my property?
What process do you go through to choose a tenant?

5. Ask about their services

A good property manager should be upfront about their services and fees. Ask them how they would conduct the following:

Legal tenant checks
Checking tenant employment, income and references
Bonds and security deposits
Disputes with either tenants or landlords
Emergencies
Who will manage your property if they go on holiday or leave

6. Ask a lot of questions

Asking the following questions will show the depth of their knowledge and their commitment to giving a good service:

Who would manage my property after I sign the lease?
Who would show my prospective tenants through my property during open homes or until it's rented?
How often would you communicate with me when my property becomes vacant?
How would you recover rental arrears?
What’s your process in dealing with repairs and maintenance of a rental property?
Can you ensure that repairs and maintenance costs are competitively priced?
If insurance claims need to be lodged, will you assist?
Can you provide verbal progress reports on request?

7. Pick the best manager, not the cheapest

You don’t save money by choosing the cheapest property manager in town if you end up with rental arrears and a poorly managed property later on. Pick someone who you feel has the skills, experience and personality to manage a rental property well.

"National population growth remains strong but continues to trend lower while dwelling construction is booming, creating a much closer relationship between housing supply and demand.

Demographic data for December 2015 was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in late June, with the data estimating national population at 23.9 million persons - increasing by 326,073 persons over the 2015 calendar year. The annual increase in population has fallen substantially from a peak of 459,504 persons over the 12 months to December 2008.

While population growth (ie housing demand) has slowed, dwelling construction has increased to record highs. Over the 12 months to December 2015, there was a record-high 190,072 dwellings constructed nationally.

With an increasing population, and the majority of growth coming from overseas migration, additional demand for housing is created. The charts published below look at the ratio of population growth to dwelling completions. A few important things to note from this analysis:

The figures don’t take into consideration demolitions and homes constructed for non-permanent or semi-permanent occupation (previously estimated by the RBA at approximately 15%)
Dwelling completions data may include construction of temporary accommodation such as hotels or serviced apartments
An increase in population doesn’t necessarily create more demand for housing. For example a family having a baby may not create an immediate requirement for more housing while a new arrival from overseas is more likely to create additional housing demand.

The latest housing and occupancy costs research from the ABS showed that the average household sizes across each state and territory in June 2014 was: 2.6 persons in NSW, Vic, Qld and ACT, 2.4 persons in SA and Tas and 2.7 persons in WA and NT.

Ratio of Population Growth to Dwelling Completions

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

If we look at the charts, over 2015 the ratios of population growth to dwelling completions have been recorded at: 2.4 in NSW, 1.9 in Vic, 1.6 in Qld, 1.0 in both SA and WA, 0.8 in Tas, 0.4 in NT and 1.3 in ACT. Based on these measures compared to the average household size it would appear that each state and territory is currently over-building however, there are some short-comings of this analysis as detailed above. It is clear that the ratio compared to the long-run average implies that under-building is still taking place in NSW and Vic while over-building is occurring elsewhere.

Additionally, in most states, there has previously been a substantial undersupply of housing which will continue to overhang any overbuilding for a period of time.

Another thing to consider when looking at this analysis is the type of dwellings that are being constructed. Units are becoming a much more prominent part of dwelling construction. Units are often smaller and therefore likely to house fewer residents than a detached house which also has an impact on these figures.

Although this analysis doesn’t provide a definitive answer to whether too much construction is taking place it is clear that as population growth has slowed and dwelling construction has ramped-up there is now a much better relationship between housing supply and demand. This is highlighted by the fact that in most states and territories there has been a sharp decline in the ratio of population growth to dwelling completions over recent years.

With many new dwellings under construction and even more approved to commence construction, developers should take heed of these figures and exercise caution when looking to undertake new projects. As population growth trends lower and construction ramps up, housing shortages appear to be diminishing quite rapidly.

"Your home is outdated and you’re trying to decide if renovating is your best option, or if you should sell and move to a new property. 

I understand your dilemma – my wife and I faced a similar situation many years ago when we lived in the UK. Our property needed modernising and we had to decide whether to renovate it or sell it and move on. 

In the end, we decided to renovate because we liked where we lived and we thought we could add value. As it turned out, that was the right decision because we did add value – and that value enabled us to move in to a bigger and better property a few years down the track.

There are many factors to consider when deciding whether to renovate or buy a new property. To help you decide, here are the three important steps my wife and I followed to help us reach a decision…

Step 1: Be really clear about the type of property you want.

This requires you to think about your immediate and future requirements.

For instance, what will your family needs be in a year, two years or five years? Where will you be working? What sort of job will you have? Do you want to be close to family and friends? These types of questions will help you decide the type of property you need and its ideal location.

For example, you might want or need a property that is bigger, has a better garden or view, is in a different suburb or position – like closer to shops, transport and other amenities, has a better floor plan and even a different interior design.

Whatever your needs, you should compare and contrast them with your current home to help identify any major gaps or shortcomings.

Step 2: Compare property values in your street and suburb.

This is a very important step. This goes to the heart of assessing how your property stacks up against everyone else’s, and whether there are any major price differentials.

If there are differences you need to find out why. For instance, it could be the issue of your home being outdated, or that it is on a smaller block, or a host of other reasons. This is where talking to local selling agents and getting a free home appraisal and advice can be really valuable.

You can also jump online and get a free property estimate, together with checking out the prices achieved on recent sales in your area, to help benchmark your own property’s value. The reason for doing this is twofold. Firstly, to help you decide if it’s worth putting the time, effort and money into renovating, and secondly to help reduce the likelihood of overcapitalizing – that is, spending too much on your renovation.

Step 3: Do your sums

Once you’ve completed steps one and two, it’s time to start crunching some numbers and prepare a budget.

Your budget needs to be more than a guesstimate. You really need to bring in the experts – like a builder – to get a detailed costing of any planned renovations, as well as taking into account the full cost of buying and moving into a new property.

Remember, if you decide to sell and move, you will need to factor stamp duty, legal fees and moving costs into your budget. You also need to assess the extent to which the proceeds of the sale of your existing property will cover the total costs of your new home.

Doing your sums is the financial side of the equation, and is all about letting you know what you can reasonably afford – which in itself may determine your best option.

As a closing thought, whether you renovate or sell, it is often a balance between what bests fits your personal lifestyle needs, what’s affordable, what’s less disruptive and what gives you the best chance of long-term capital growth. However, if you plan to sell your property within the next one to two years, be very mindful of undertaking a major renovation project – you need to make sure you can at least recoup the cost of your investment.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will hold the official cash rate at 1.75% in July, following a recent 25 basis point reduction in May.

The decision comes as expected, as the Reserve Bank navigates layers of political uncertainty and awaits inflation results for the second quarter of 2016.

While rates have been kept on hold for two consecutive months now, many are expecting a further 25 basis point rate cut this year. With the shock Brexit referendum result and a potentially hung parliament in Australia, the rate cut could come as soon as August.

Inflation is currently at a record low of 1.3% in the year to March 2016. As discussed last month, this is likely the result of under-employment (8.71%) and historically low wage growth (2.1%).

As inflation falls, the RBA is increasingly likely to use the remaining ammunition it has in the official cash rate to stimulate economic activity.

Spending and inflation is affected by levels of business of consumer confidence, which may be shaken by recent political events. Markets responded quickly and harshly to the results of the United Kingdom referendum on the 23 June, with the AUD down 1.2% by the following trading day.

Many markets have since rallied following the initial post-Brexit impact. However, there are medium-term impacts on the Australian economy to consider that have increased the likelihood of future rate cuts:

Investing in Australia: Australia has less exposure to shocks from the European Union since receiving higher investment from China, however in April 2016 the EU made up 12% of the value demanded of Australian exports. In 2014, the EU contributed almost $170 billion in foreign direct investment into Australia with 51% of that foreign direct investment coming from Britain.

Threats to Free Trade Agreements: In November last year, the Australian government began negotiations on a free trade deal with EU. This process will now be hindered by the Brexit, which in itself is a manifestation of a more protectionist sentiment from the UK.

Indirect Impacts: China and the EU also have a trading relationship that will be complicated by Britain exiting the EU. If growth in China slows, demand for Australian exports from China may be affected. Alternatively, falling prospects in the EU could direct more investment into Australia.

A future rate cut by the RBA may not have a significant impact on the Australian property market, which is slowly entering a downswing.

The latest statistics show that the property market was steady over the May quarter, with 1.34% and 0.95% growth in Australia wide houses and units respectively. The particularly strong performers were in regional markets such as Country NSW and Hobart, as investors and owner occupiers spill out to more affordable areas.

New lending to both investors and owner occupiers has fallen, with investor lending experiencing a sharper fall. However, Australia’s property market is still outperforming many international stock and currency markets. As ageing populations look to grow wealth before retirement in a climate of economic uncertainty, many people may still try to enter the Australian property market.

The impact of low interest rates on the property market has previously been somewhat ‘intercepted’ by regulatory authorities who have attempted to limit home lending to investors and increase capital held by banks. However, irrespective of interest rates, recent events could still direct investors to property – the historically safe investment market – staving off the downswing for another few months.

"The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released building activity data last week that showed a record number of dwellings are currently under construction across the nation.

According to building activity data for the March 2016 quarter, there were 25,122 houses and 29,987 units that commenced construction nationally over the quarter.

Chart 1 shows that while commencements for houses eased over the quarter, unit commencements increased to a new record-high. The number of house commencements fell for the second consecutive quarter.

House commencements increased over the quarter in SA, Tas and NT but fell elsewhere. For units, commencements were at record highs in NSW and Qld and also rose in SA and the ACT over the March 2016 quarter.

Chart 1: Quarterly Dwelling Commencements, House vs. Units

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

Looking at dwelling completions, both house and unit completions were lower over the quarter, with unit completions having fallen for the second successive quarter. Over the March 2016 quarter, there were 23,218 houses and 15,002 units completed. Completions for houses fell across each state and territory over the quarter, while they were lower for units over the quarter in all states and territories except for NSW and SA.

Chart 2: Quarterly Dwelling Completions, House vs. Units

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

Although completions have fallen, there is a record-high number of dwellings currently under construction that is being fuelled by units which typically take longer to build than houses. At the end of March 2016 there were 215,863 dwellings under construction nationally, 63,414 of which were houses and 152,449 were units. Year-on-year, the number of dwellings under construction has increased by 18.6%, with the number of houses under construction -5.4% lower while units under construction are 32.6% higher.

The number of houses under construction is well below previous peaks in all states and territories with the number under construction lower over the quarter in Qld, WA, Tas and Act, but higher elsewhere. For units, there are currently record-high numbers of units under construction in NSW, Vic and Qld, which reiterates the magnitude of the current unit construction boom. In all states and territories except WA, Tas and NT the number of units under construction has increased over the quarter.

Chart 3: Quarterly Number of Dwellings Under Construction, Houses vs. Units

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

While the number of dwellings under construction is at record highs, we are also seeing an elevated number of houses and units that have been approved for construction but not yet commenced. At the end of March 2016 there were 8,817 houses and 24,175 units that had been approved for construction but not yet commenced. With completed and under construction supply ramping up sharply over recent years, it is reasonable to expect that fewer recently approved dwellings will actually commence in the short-term. Particularly when you consider that high-rise unit construction is at record-high levels and the considerable level of risk in constructing such a large project.

Chart 4: Number of Dwellings Approved But Not Yet Commenced, Houses vs. Units

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

The record-high number of dwellings under construction and the continuing strong pipeline of approvals should ensure that there is plenty of work for the construction industry over the coming years. There is the concern of over-building in certain areas, especially considering much of the new unit supply in certain locations is targeted at an investor rather than owner occupier market. We would expect that over the coming quarters an increasing proportion of dwellings, particularly units, that are approved for construction will not be commenced. This is largely due to challenges with securing enough presales to trigger commencement of these projects.

"Market Update

The latest property data and analysis reveals a relatively positive result for Australia’s housing market.

Table 1 presents the statistical summary for the major markets across Australia.

Table 1: May 2016 Summary

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

The standout performer this quarter was Hobart, which topped the chart for capital growth gains in both its house and its unit markets. While Hobart’s house market posted a strong 2.59% growth in the May quarter, it was growth in the unit market that has caused jaws to drop. Over the May quarter, Hobart units increased in value by a shocking 6.66% – which amounts to a value increase of almost $18,000.

Other strong growth performers for the quarter include Country NSW houses (2.39%) and Regional Queensland units (2.44%).

In other parts of Australia, a slowed decline in the resource markets (Perth and Darwin) suggests prices in are rebounding from a cyclical trough. Growth in Perth house values was 2.08% in the May quarter – its highest rate of growth since March 2014.

Understanding Growth in Hobart

As mentioned above, Hobart units recorded an astonishing 6.66% growth in the May quarter. However, it is important to consider the big picture with Hobart unit values, as growth in this market has been less consistent over the last five years compared to other capital cities.

Graph 1 provides quarterly capital growth and sales numbers for the Hobart unit market.

Graph 1: Quarterly Capital Growth and Sales Numbers – Units, Greater Hobart

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

As displayed in the graph, the strong growth recorded in the May (2016) quarter comes off the back of negative growth in the previous two quarters. It also follows losses between 2011 and 2013. To put this in perspective, if you invested in the median Hobart unit in May 2010 (when the median value was $282,000), you will have made nominal gains of just $5,000 in capital growth since buying the unit.

Much of the stunted growth in Hobart is a result of the end of the mining boom and economic growth constraints such as geographic separation from the rest of Australia. However, as the Australian economy moves away from mining and into tourism, and those close to retirement develop an increased interest for investment properties, Hobart units suddenly present an affordable opportunity with high rental yields – which could account for the rebound of growth in the May quarter.

It is true that tourism has grown in Tasmania. Visitation to Tasmania and visitor expenditure in Tasmania grew approximately 7% in the year to March 2016. During this time, most visitors were people within Australia (85%), particularly Victoria (37%). A persistently low AUD may be encouraging domestic tourism for Australians as opposed to overseas visitors. Simultaneously, the low AUD could encourage further increases in international visitation, but this too is dependent on the stability of the global economy. Confidence in the global economy continues to be threatened by heavy migration flows and the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union in the short term.

Another important factor to consider is the wider Australian housing market, which is in the downswing phase of its growth cycle. As growth slows, the wealth effect of housing diminishes which may also reduce interstate visitation to Tasmania.

Another important consideration for those looking to Tasmania is rent. The rental yield on the median Hobart unit is currently 5.53%. Graph 2 presents the dollar value rent for the median Hobart unit since 2010.

Graph 2: Historical Median Rent – Hobart Units

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

The graph shows that rent has trended upwards and in the year to May 2016, rent increased by $20 per week. However, if wage growth does not grow with rents, rental returns may be held back by affordability problems.

A report by SGS Economics and Planning has found that some households in the greater Hobart region are spending an estimated 50-80% of their disposable income on rent. Anecdotal reports suggest that homelessness is steadily increasing in the region, however the report uses 2011 Census income data and therefore discounts wage growth over the last five years.

As the value of Hobart units increase, rental yields are most likely going to fall. The extent of the fall will depend on the rate of wage growth in the region, and this is an important consideration depending on your investment strategy.

Finally, it is important to consider some of the more endogenous structural growth constraints in Tasmania.

The unemployment rate in Tasmania was 6.5% in May (seasonally adjusted), and the state also has the lowest rate of Year 12 completion for 20-24 year olds (58%) due to irregular school structures.

Should Labour win government in the upcoming July 2 election, the opposition leader has pledged $150 million to the University of Tasmania and small business incentives to encourage a culture of further education, which could create long term job and growth prospects.

Seasonality: Winter is Coming

The steady performance of Australia’s housing markets could be a culmination of the recent cash rate cut in May making credit more easily available, and the general seasonal effect of autumn – which has historically seen higher quarterly growth rates in select Australian housing markets.

Graph 3 shows the historical quarterly capital growth average of houses and units across the different seasons in Sydney and Melbourne.

Graph 3: Average Seasonal Capital Growth, Last 20 Years

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

As you can see by the graph, summer and winter have historically provided weaker capital growth outcomes compared to the autumn and spring seasons.

Across the historical growth rates, standard deviations in each season are low and fairly uniform – suggesting seasonal variations are reliable in these markets.

Given we have moved into winter, and based on the historical findings presented in the graph, we could expect to see a slight drop in capital growth rates in Sydney and Melbourne in the August quarter. However, with this in mind, it is important to mention that historical growth rates during this period have still been strong over the past 20 years.

While seasonal expectations can be applied to Sydney and Melbourne, the Brisbane market does not reflect the same historical seasonal growth trends. Further to this, Brisbane units are different again to Brisbane houses.

Graph 4: Brisbane Houses Average Seasonal Capital Growth, Last 20 Years

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

It could be that idiosyncrasies in the Brisbane house and unit markets make purchases and growth stronger at different times. For example, the purchase or sale of an investment property may be more advantageous before the end of the financial year, making autumn an active time for units over houses.

While more research is required before making seasonal generalisations across all markets, winter does seem to deliver persistently lower rates of growth across Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Conclusion

Over the next few months, I would expect to see lower rates of growth across Australia. A significant mitigation to this would be continued investment fuelled by the current low interest rates, as well as recent reforms to self-managed super funds which enables those approaching retirement to borrow and buy.

"With the end of the financial year just around the corner, here are some general tax strategies for property investors to consider.

1. Documentation

Keep summaries of all your rental income and expenses.

This is much easier if you have your management agent looking after your property where they pay all expenses and collect all income. They will normally provide a monthly and annual statement.

Ensure you have all bank statements showing interest expense. The annual statement should show a summary of interest expense.

A specialist property accountant can assist by ensuring all allowable tax deductions are made.

2. Depreciation

Only registered quantity surveyors are generally authorised to prepare depreciation schedules. If you are contemplating a renovation, a quantity surveyor can produce a scrapping schedule which puts a value against all items to be thrown away. This value is expensed in the year of expenditure. The new items are then depreciated with a new depreciation schedule.

3. Travel

All costs endured to inspect your investment properties are tax deductible, including travel. Ensure you apportion any personal component.

4. Interest Expenses

Only interest expenses on borrowed funds used to invest are deductible. It is the purpose of the loan which determines deductibility, not the security used to obtain the loan.

A split loan should be considered when a loan is used for both investment and private purposes.

If capitalising interest, the tax office may require evidence of correct documentation and intention.

Interest deductibility should be easy, but if not properly documented and managed this expense can cause frustration if the ATO decides to conduct a review. Therefore, the assistance

of a specialty property accountant should be used. The Property Investor Trust® (PIT®) has an ATO Product Ruling PR2014/15 which gives PAYG taxpayers certainty of claiming interest expenses on a negatively geared property held in the PIT®.

5. Trusts

The use of a Trust can be a major benefit to property investors by improving asset protection, estate planning and increasing flexibility. If using a Trust, ensure it has been correctly set up and operated to ensure you do not lose your interest deductibility - which is fully allowable by the ATO if you meet their requirements.

6. Pre-Pay Expenses

If you have a geared investment on a fixed interest loan, it is worth considering pre-paying next year's interest to gain an immediate tax deduction. You can also get a deduction now by pre-paying next year's income protection insurance premiums.

Also consider bringing forward expenditure that would otherwise be spent after 30 June. If you are planning on doing repairs on your property, note that care should be taken in determining whether a maintenance or repair is deductible, or if it is considered a renovation or of a capital nature.

Consider pre-paying other expenses such as rates, levies or possibly even interest (in the right circumstances).

7. Manage Capital Gains

Capital gains generated during the year can be minimised by offsetting it against capital losses or trading losses incurred during the same year. To reduce capital gain generated on sale of property or other assets during the year consider selling any assets which have lost value and their future is bleak. The 50% discount on capital gains is available where an asset is held for longer than 12 months. As this is a considerable saving consider the timing of any sale. The relevant date for calculating capital gains is the CONTRACT date and not the settlement date.

8. Manage Capital Losses

Capital losses incurred in any year are available to be carried forward to future years if there are insufficient gains to absorb it

in the same year. It can be carried forward for an indefinite period.

Capital losses cannot be offset against other income - such as business trading income. If you've made a capital gain this year, review your portfolio to see whether it is worth realising a capital loss to offset the gain.

You can't carry losses back. So if you've made a capital gain, you may want to trigger a loss to offset it against.

9. PAYG Variation

Where you have negatively geared rental investments, the negative part offsets against your other income (e.g. salary), reducing your tax payable and resulting in a large refund when your tax return is lodged. This refund can be used to reduce your loan, pay your interest expenses or help finance another investment property.

To help with cash flow, wouldn't be great if you were able to access your refund throughout the year instead of waiting till the end of the year? This can help finance an extra property that has potential to pick up some capital growth between the beginning and end of year. This can be done by lodging an application to vary the ‘Income Tax Withholding’ using a form from ATO. PAYG instalment obligations should be reviewed and consideration given to varying the instalment, where the estimate of income tax payable for the year is less than the instalments raised by the ATO. This will reduce the impact of this instalment on your cash-flow.

"Just because you don’t earn a six-figure salary, or you don’t have many assets yet, it doesn’t mean you can’t break into the property market.

Granted that property prices have soared in the recent years, starting up a property investment portfolio is still a realistic prospect for a determined investor.

But first, a reality check

For low-income earners, getting finance is easily the most challenging part of getting started. This is where a lot of beginner investors get stopped. Without a mortgage, you won’t be able to buy an investment property.

Not only that, you may not get your finance approved or you may be limited to how much you can borrow. Your borrowing capacity depends largely on your income; therefore, the amount you earn will restrict the mortgage you can get and the property you can buy.

Luckily, there are many ways to overcome these challenges

While lenders have now become strict with their lending policies, you may still get your loan application approved by showing them you can pay off your mortgage.

You also need to show them you have a solid employment history and that you are paying off your debts consistently.

Most importantly, you need to keep your credit record squeaky clean.

Here are some tips to boost your chances of getting your loan approved:

Reduce unnecessary expenses

If you’re renting, you may consider moving back to your folks’ place to save rent money. This will help you improve your borrowing capacity as you now have lower living expenses.

Also limit eating out, buying that take away coffee or traveling as you build your savings.
 
Pay off your debts

Having other personal loans, car loans or high credit card limits will severely impact the amount you can borrow. Pay off your debts, or at least reduce them, as quickly as you can.
 
Make it your priority to save

With tighter lending policies, lenders are now looking for bigger savings from borrowers. Not only do you need to save more, you also need to show that you’ve been doing it consistently for a period of time.

To make it easier, you can automate your savings so a portion of your income gets paid directly into a separate savings account.
 
Consider getting a second job

Making extra cash on the side will greatly improve your chances of getting approved for a home loan. This will also help your cash flow if you already have a loan.
 
Keep your credit record clean

Having a clean credit record is a must for any borrower. Having a blemished credit record will dramatically reduce your chances of getting a loan approved with the mainstream lenders.

Make it your mission to keep it clean by paying your debts and bills promptly all the time.
 
Ask your parents to be your guarantor

By having your parents guarantee your loan application, you can break into the property market sooner. 

You can borrow the entire loan amount and your parents will guarantee the whole mortgage. This ties them up to the entirety of the loan term. 

Your guarantor can also give guarantee to just a portion of the loan or split the loan between you and them.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will hold the official cash rate at 1.75% in June, following a 25 basis point reduction in May.

It was widely expected that the cash rate would remain on hold among a few positive indicators, suggesting there was no urgent need for easier lending through a reduction in interest rates.

The first of these was growth in gross domestic product (GDP). GDP growth in the March 2016 quarter surpassed expectations of 0.7%, expanding 1.1%. This is the strongest result since the March quarter of 2012.

Ordinarily, such a strong economic growth rate may be accompanied by higher spending and consumer confidence, which may lead to discussions around tightening monetary policy to curb inflation. However, the GDP expansion was in real terms. This means that inflation is not taken into account and the measure is looking at the increase in volumes produced, rather than increases in the money earned.

Related Article: Market Update: Oversupply Fears Rise as LVRs Drop

Unusually, real GDP growth was higher than nominal GDP growth for the quarter. Therefore, the strong increase in real GDP reflected higher production rather than an increase in profits or wages. This is reaffirmed when looking at the composition of growth; a whole 1% of GDP growth came from higher export volumes. This may reflect mining companies increasing the volume of exports to compensate for lower resource prices.

Another positive indicator was the unemployment rate, which remained unchanged in April – at 5.7%. However, as noted in previous months, the composition of employment is limiting to wage growth.

For example, while there were approximately 30,000 new jobs added in April, approximately 20,000 of the positions were for part time work. Part time employment can return relatively low wages compared to full time work. One only has to consider Malcom Turnbull’s attitude towards Sunday penalty rates to see the simultaneity of job creation, but lower wages for each employee.

This phenomenon of growing employment and falling wages is one of the main reasons we could expect another cash rate cut some time this year.

Graph 1: Annual Wage Growth and Inflation 

Source: Trading Economics

Australia’s wage growth reached a historic low of 2.1% in March 2016. Wage growth has plummeted since the mining boom began to ease in 2013, which, along with the increase in part time employment, is likely a major contributor to low inflation. When wages are not growing, household consumption is less likely to grow and inflation falls. When inflation is subdued, particularly below its 2-3% target band as it is now (1.3%), the RBA is incentivised to cut rates.

Further easing in monetary policy this year may indeed refuel growth in the housing market. The April quarter saw an increase of just 0.03% in the median Sydney house, while the Melbourne median house fell by 2.63%. Both markets may see a small value increase in the May data due to the recent rate cut.

Three of the four major banks passed on the full rate cut to their home loan customers in May, and have also seized the opportunity to once again boost their investor lending following a crack down from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. In May, Westpac increased its loan-to-value ratio to investors from 80% to 90% of dwelling values.

Today’s rate decision is the last before the July 2 election, making June a good month to wait and see what economic policies manifest under the new government.

"The state governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland are all now charging additional tax on foreign investment in residential property.

Implementated on June 21, foreign buyers in New South Wales now have to pay a 4% stamp duty surcharge. In Victoria, foreign buyers are charged a 7% tax while the surchage in Queensland is 3%. All three of these taxes are specifically targeted on transactions of property by foreign buyers.

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

Property (both residential and non-residential) is already the largest source of taxation revenue for state and local governments. These additional charges to foreign investors in the three most populous states will probably raise additional revenue (as long as the higher cost of doing business doesn’t result in a downturn in demand from overseas buyers). For each government, there is a benefit in these changes outside of additional revenue; foreigners don’t vote, so politically it is likely to be a fairly popular decision. This is especially the case for New South Wales and Victoria, where housing affordability is a growing problem and there is a perception that foreign investors are bidding up prices and contributing to locking first home buyers out of the market.

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

In New South Wales, state and local governments collected $14.705 billion in property taxes over the 2014-15 financial year. Property tax revenue increased by 12.8% over the year and has increased by 80.5% over the decade to 2014-15. Property taxes accounted for 48.5% of total taxation revenue to New South Wales state and local government in 2014-15.

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

In Victoria, state and local governments collected $12.246 billion in property taxes over the 2014-15 financial year which accounted for 53.1% of total taxation revenue. Property tax revenue increased by 10.7% over the 2014-15 financial year to be 109.9% higher over the past decade.

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

Queensland property tax revenue increased by 12.6% over the 2014-15 financial year to be 80.7% higher over the decade. Over the 2014-15 financial year Queensland state and local governments collected $8.267 billion in property tax revenue which accounted for 51.5% of total state and local government tax revenue.

Over the decade to June 2015, property taxes have increased by 80.5% in New South Wales, 109.9% in Victoria and 80.7% in Queensland, over the same timeframe inflation has increased by 30.1% which is significantly lower than growth in property taxation.

Given the importance of property tax revenue to state and local governments it is no wonder that the three largest states have decided to increase taxes on foreign investment. These changes don’t impact on voters and they collect additional much needed revenue.

My concern is that it shows that none of these states have any intention of moving away from transactional taxes on property to more efficient land taxes. Keep in mind that in a typical year only around 5% to 7% of residential properties are transacting so you are only collecting stamp duty from a small proportion of the housing market that are deciding to move. When transactions and values slow or fall, stamp duty revenue is also susceptible to large declines.

Source: CoreLogic, ABS

In New South Wales and Victoria, governments are gaining substantial revenue from stamp duty as property values and transactions rise. In New South Wales, stamp duty collection rose 22.2% in 2014-15, in Victoria it rose by 18.9% and in Queensland it was 12.3% higher. Over the past decade, the total increase in stamp duty revenue has been recorded at: 125.1% in New South Wales, 116.8% in Victoria and 56.1% in Queensland.

Some of the commentary around the increases in tax have been around the fact that without foreign investors many of the new housing (particularly unit) projects would never have even commenced construction. To me, this is really the crux of the problem. As the resource investment boom has faded to some extent housing construction has helped to fill the void. If a projects viability is totally dependent on foreign demand, to me that suggests that it is not really a viable project. The reality is that the current home value growth phase has now been running for four years and new housing construction and unit construction in particular has hit record highs. Foreign investment has increased quite significantly over this time however, many of these purchasers are buying units which many locals wouldn’t purchase due to the size, location and price of these properties. Furthermore, anecdotally many of these properties don’t actually create additional housing because they are left empty and not made available for rent.

I believe that these additional charges will provide some deterrent for foreign buyers investing as the costs continue to add up with FIRB application fees and now these additional charges. Of course, while these changes may deter some investors other will just see it as a cost of doing business and it shouldn’t impact them too much if they are investing for the long-term. If fewer foreign investors results in some new housing projects not going ahead, that is not necessarily a problem either in light of the fact that housing supply has increased dramatically over recent years and will continue to do so over the coming years given the housing currently under construction. Finally if it means that certain developers decide to rotate their offering away from one catering to foreign buyers and towards one which is more palatable to a local market, I believe that is a good thing.

Ultimately these changes may deter some foreign investment but these changes are not going to scare off all foreigners from investing in housing market. At the same time it will raise much needed revenue for these governments. If state governments are looking at taxes on property I would once again call on them to look for a way to move away from stamp duty to a more efficient land tax.

"With the Reserve Bank cutting the official cash rate to its lowest point on record in May (1.75%), are negative interest rates on the horizon for Australia?

Related Article: RBA Cuts Rates in May

Negative interest rates, which central banks in Switzerland (-0.75%), Sweden (-0.50) and Japan (-0.10) have currently implemented, are an unconventional monetary tool used to spur economic growth.

Negative interest rates are exactly what they sound like – depositing money actually attracts a charge rather than earning interest. The idea behind this is that this will cause the banks to not deposit any more money than necessary with the Reserve Bank, and will instead lend the money – or invest in more profitable activities with higher returns. Instead of earning interest on money left with the central bank, banks are charged by the central bank to park their cash with it. The hope is that this will encourage the banks to stop hoarding money and instead lend more to each other, to consumers and to businesses, which would in turn boosting the broader economy.

What does this mean for customers?

This will vary from bank to bank. Your bank may lower or charge its own negative interest rates, keep them the same and eat the loss, or charge interest indirectly through higher deposit fees.

Commonwealth Bank Chief Currency Strategist, Richard Grace, estimates that there will be €124 billion of excess liquidity (cash) as a result of the negative interest rate movements in Europe. This gives banks a couple of options:

Lending the money into the economy (which the European Central Bank wants)
Parking the money in interest-paying German or French bonds, or shuffling it into higher-yielding assets such as the Aussie dollar.

Grace stresses that it's the commercial banks that decide whether to pass on negative interest rates to their customers. Switzerland is one country where the central bank introduced negative interest rates on deposits and commercial banks followed suit.

While the negative interest rates have grabbed the headlines, it's the attempt to push down interest rates right across the economy that means the ""refi"" rate cut is actually the most important measure announced.

Will it work?

No one knows. In theory, it sounds attractive but it has never been attempted by the central bank of Europe and could have unpredictable and unintended consequences. Those consequences include the possibility that banks will pass on the costs they incur for depositing money with the central bank to customers.

A broad risk is that a negative return on parking funds with the central bank might encourage banks to invest in riskier assets to secure a return, potentially driving new asset bubbles and more pain further down the line.

As part of this bid to find alternative investments, banks are likely to increase their purchases of government bonds. However, this has potential serious consequences if banks are holding bonds to such an extent that government borrowing costs are artificially low. If a financial shock occurs, the banks and governments could find themselves so intertwined and interdependent that they drag each other - and the economy - down.

"Market Update

You may have noticed bearish headlines over the past few weeks where the property market and its affiliates were referenced, with words such as tightening, clamping and crunching being used. This is unsurprising given the downswing we are entering in the market cycle, but I believe further context and data are needed for a more grounded perspective.

The latest property market data and analysis has revealed stagnant growth in the Sydney house market, a historical high unit median for the Sydney market, easing in Melbourne and an ease in the fall of growth in the resource regions of Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

Table 1 presents the statistics summary for April.

Table 1: April 2016 Summary

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

As you can see in the table, quarterly growth in Sydney house values was a modest 0.03%. This comes off the back of losses in the March quarter, and the result is a stagnant median house value of just over $1,040,000 – where it has been hovering since January.

On the other hand, units in the Sydney market increased a significant 1.26% over the April quarter. This follows losses in January and the median value is now at a historical high of $695,000.

The Melbourne market experienced more significant easing in the April quarter, with declines in median values of approximately $5,000 and $3,000 in the house and unit markets respectively. With Melbourne having a tendency to follow Sydney at a lag, there could be further short-term fluctuations in this market to come over the next few months – rather than a distinct downward trend.

Property values continue to fall in the resource regions of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. However, even though April quarterly growth remained in negative territory in the Perth and Darwin house markets, the figures were slightly better than those recorded in the March quarter, suggesting an ease in the fall of growth. Annual growth for these markets is presented in Graph 1.

Graph 1: Annual Growth Rates – Perth and Darwin

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

The graph shows that property values have been falling in these areas throughout much of 2015 up to today. It has been established that movements in commodities can be closely tied to economic and housing market performance in WA and the NT. Despite a small rally in the commodity price index in the first quarter of 2016, iron ore is still less than one third of what it was worth when it peaked at US$180 in February 2011.

Additionally, profits from the mining sector are not as widely spread throughout the states, as the operational phase of the mining boom employs less labour than the construction period. Interestingly, it seems that the Queensland labour market is suffering a higher unemployment rate (6.5%) in response to mining divestment. This could be because of the tighter labour markets in WA and the NT, where workers have higher mobility in response to mining and construction projects.

Oversupply Fears Rise as LVRs Drop

News of Macquarie Bank tightening its loan to value ratio (LVR) for apartment high-rises has sparked fears of an oversupply in certain markets. The bank named 46 postcodes where high-rise apartment lending would shrink to 70% of the value of the property. The problem in these postcodes – which are concentrated in inner Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane – is not one of supply and demand, at least not in the sense that there are more apartments than there are people to live in them. Supply and demand in these markets is not a question of how many people need a place to live versus how many places there are to live. Rather it is how many owner-occupiers and investors demand assets.

The former conception of supply and demand ignores the tax and finance incentives that encourage people to hold more property than they need to live in. These incentives include cash-free equity deposits, negative gearing and capital gains concessions, which have been introduced one by one into the housing market over the last 30 years. It makes sense then, that our understanding of supply and demand in real estate should be dynamic. As long as there is an investor looking for a property to put their money in, there is demand. As long as there is an investor demanding property, a developer is willing to supply.

Professor Laurence Murphy of the University of Auckland notes that when the price of property begins to fall, developers become less willing to supply dwellings. Graph 2 and 3 compare high-rise approval data in Victoria and NSW (which we have to assume is a proxy for inner city unit development) with quarterly growth rates in their respective unit markets.

Graph 2: Quarterly Approval Figures Victoria vs. Melbourne Units Quarterly Growth Rates

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

Graph 3: Quarterly Approval Figures NSW vs. Sydney Units Quarterly Growth Rates

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

The graphs show that approvals are highly responsive to changes in unit growth rates.

As demand for units falls away due to tighter LVRs, slowed wage growth and higher premiums on foreign investment purchases[1], the first thing to crash will most likely be applications and construction of dwellings. This has wider economic implications, particularly for Victoria and NSW, where construction has been a significant contributor to growth in gross state product.

The construction of units – whether in the application, construction or completion phase – moves in much larger fluctuations than the values of the units themselves. For example, in the September quarter of 2010, the number of approvals for units in blocks of four or more stories grew by 124% in NSW, yet nothing dramatic happened with Sydney unit value growth. Values grew steadily until 2013 when they began to grow at a higher rate. I am not saying that the supply of units to speculative investors is sustainable where population growth is low, nor is it optimal for the people living in them. However, it is clear that price movements and investor interest in units are a better indicator of expected supply movements than population growth rates.

The graphs also show the approval figures for other dwelling types over the past decade. Most strikingly, the number of high-rise units began outperforming detached housing approvals from March 2011. The salience of this phenomenon increased around the beginning of the 2013 housing boom.

Less important than the effect of supply on the value of a unit is the way units are supplied and how they are integrated with wider planning. Residential dwellings crowding out commercial and cultural facilities, which are partly what makes a city desirable in the first place, can limit a city’s desirability. A lack of diverse planning can also increase pressure on transport and road congestion. This is one of the many risks of investing in rapid high-rise growth areas, and has caused some young families and retirees to move to regional parts of the state.

Conclusion

Across the country, the transition from mining to service industries is overstated in its ability to absorb lost jobs and income. The official Australian unemployment rate was 5.7% in April (seasonally adjusted), unchanged from the previous month. However, April saw the loss of 9,300 full time jobs and an increase in 20,000 part time positions. While the official statistics imply a steady unemployment rate, employment is being picked up through more precarious work.

Given that part time and casual work has been linked to reduced bargaining power for pay increases, it is no surprise that increases in Australia’s annual wage growth reached a historic low of 2.1% in the March quarter. Low wages may also be contributing to low inflation, which is in turn fuelling expectations of further cash rate cuts this year.

Moving forward, I would expect modest falls in house values in the major east coast cities, while units and resource market dwellings adjust to changed conditions in demand. Low interest rates and falling dwelling prices may present opportunity in certain markets across the country, but purchasers should look for strong and diverse economic fundamentals in the markets they choose to buy in.

[1]According to Foreign Investment Review Board data, foreign investment makes up a small, but rapidly increasing percentage of the value of transactions in our housing market. Scholars have noted that official data suggests foreign investment is not significant enough to be pushing up dwelling values. Furthermore, higher premiums on the purchase of property in Australia may not deter foreign investors, but would raise government revenue should demand remain steady. The price elasticity of demand from foreign investors in Australian real estate remains to be seen.

 


Published: 1 June, 2016.",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,Market Update: Oversupply Fears Rise as LVRs Drop
"The Reserve Bank of Australia announced it will reduce the official cash rate by 25 basis points to 1.75% in May, making this the first cash rate cut since May 2015. The decision was a tough call amid lower than expected inflation, low consumer sentiment and a downward trend in house price growth.

Tuesday’s cut had a powerful effect on the Aussie dollar (AUD), which lost over 2% against the US dollar (USD) in a single trading day. By close of trade, the AUD was at US$0.75. Graph 1 shows what happened to the AUD when the RBA announced the cash rate cut.

So why did the AUD take such a strong hit in reaction to the cash rate cut?

When official interest rates on Australian dollars are lowered, the currency becomes less expensive to borrow – it is devalued. This may have led traders to sell off the AUD, as the currency they were holding was about to be worth less.

When the RBA has previously cut rates, traders expected prices to go down but back up again in the long run. This means that previous rate cuts have been followed by a small rally in the AUD, as people think the AUD is a bargain fresh after rate cut announcements.

However, the AUD has not rallied this time, suggesting people expect the AUD to stay low or keep going down. The RBA has been hoping for a drop in the AUD to make Australian exports more competitive. Unfortunately, if you planning a holiday the United States, this might not be good news: With the AU$1.00 buying just US$0.75, Australians are losing purchasing power for US goods and services.

Until inflation was reported on 27 April, few people expected a cash rate cut last Tuesday. Inflation – the rate at which the price of goods and services increases – was just 1.3% in the year to March, which is well below expectations of 1.7%. The monthly inflation result showed that prices actually declined across the country by 0.2%.

When inflation is low or falling (falling inflation is also known as deflation), central banks tend to lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, thus pushing up inflation. Central banks have an ‘inflation target’ where interest rates are used to keep inflation between 2 to 3% per year.

Market expectations of a cash rate cut were indicated by the AUD before Tuesday’s announcement, which instantly dropped in response to the news of low inflation, as shown in Graph 1. This is because investors may have assumed that the low inflation would prompt the RBA to drop rates and started to pre-emptively sell off the AUD.

Graph 1: Movements of the AUD in Response to Inflation Report

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

However, the power of an interest rate cut to actually stimulate inflation may be limited. This is evident from Japan and the Euro area, where central banks are struggling with deflation despite negative interest rates. Lower interest rates in these regions have led to a loss of confidence in the economy, which has perversely worked to further limit spending and drag down inflation. This monetary tool seems less effective than it has been in the past to stimulate spending, and a lower cash rate potentially threatens confidence in the Australian economy.

In Australia, the March inflation figures suggest that consumption is falling in the economy. This is unsurprising given that 2015 saw a rapid increase in the cost of housing while wage growth was at a historically low 2.2%. As housing costs rose over 2015, people likely had to reallocate their largely stagnant incomes which would have led to a larger portion of income servicing housing costs and less going to things like food and entertainment.

However, as of March this year, the major east coast markets are coming into a downswing phase with the price of houses and units in Sydney and Melbourne beginning to fall. Our latest data shows that the median house value in Sydney fell by 2.17% in the March quarter, which is equivalent to around $23,000. In Melbourne, during the same period, the decline was $11,000 (-1.53%). This is an expected part of property growth cycles. In fact, of the eight capital city markets, six saw a reduction in house values for the March quarter.

As demonstrated in the graph, this market peaked in late 2015 and is now moving into the downswing phase. As Australians are usually very responsive to interest rate cuts and the demand for housing, holding the cash rate steady at 2% may have allowed quicker adjustment to more affordable dwelling prices.

However, holding the cash rate in the context of falling house prices can also be dangerous for consumption. This is because in Australia, houses contribute to the ‘wealth effect’. When the value of houses begin to fall, people believe they have less purchasing power and spend less. When this is the sentiment, easier access to credit may be beneficial, justifying a cut in the cash rate.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute of Consumer Sentiment Index fell by 4% in April to 95.1. The index, compiled from a survey of 1,200 households, suggests that people were generally more pessimistic about the economy in April than optimistic.

Unemployment at March was 5.7%, but the labour force participation rate has also trended down to 64.9%. It is worth noting that the participation rate is still above the 20 year average of 64.2%. The cut in the official cash rate may expand employment opportunities.

A bright spot in the economy came from the Ai Group’s performance of manufacturing index (PMI), which was at 53.4 in April. Although this is well below the previous month, an indicator of above 50 signals growth. The Manufacturing PMI has been trending upwards since July last year.

This month’s rate decision came on the same day as the Turnbull government hands down the Federal Budget. At its meeting in April, leaders of the International Monetary Fund encouraged both fiscal and monetary leaders to cooperate in easing access to capital and promoting greater equity in the distribution of wealth. A reduced cash rate will give the government slightly more flexibility in implementing fiscal policy, which seems to be directed at stimulating growth for business. Given falling output, demand from China and persistently low commodity prices, the cash rate cut may also make Australia more resilient in the face of future economic shocks.

"Market Update

The latest data and analysis of the Australian housing market reveals that 17 of our major dwelling markets recorded negative growth in the March quarter. Table 1 presents the latest statistics summary.

The surprising capital growth standouts were the ACT and Hobart – Australia’s smaller and often forgotten cities. Capital growth in ACT houses was a strong 6.39% in the year to March, while houses in Hobart grew a solid 4.82% during the same time period.

On a cyclical level, these movements are expected. Over the last decade, the ACT and Hobart house markets have generally experienced peaks and troughs just after Sydney (see Graph 1). Hobart especially had room for capital growth off the back of a cyclical trough, where annual growth was -9.13% in 2012.

It is not clear why the housing markets move together. It could be that as property becomes more out of reach during upswings in Sydney, investors spill over into the more affordable markets nearby. It could also be that increases or decreases in the Sydney market send signals to investors in other markets that it’s a good time to buy or sell property. Given that Sydney is now coming into downswing, I expect that the ACT and Hobart will soon reach peak growth in their cycles.

There are also structural factors that have aided growth in these markets over the last 12 months. In May last year, the federal government lifted a two year public service hiring freeze in Canberra, which increased job prospects and potential migration to the capital.

The Hobart dwelling market benefited from increased confidence in its economy, aided by a transition from mining to tourism, increased visitation from domestic and international tourists, and export subsidies from the federal government.

Despite the slowdown across Australia, comments around affordability have once again circulated over the last month. Onthehouse.com.au figures can bring a little more insight to some of the claims made.

Vacant Properties: Are the Figures Overstated?

In March this year, investigation from the City Futures Research Centre at the University of New South Wales suggested that vacant properties across Sydney were constricting supply and adding to unaffordability[1].

The number of unoccupied dwellings in Sydney was derived from 2011 Census data, and researchers found that approximately 120,000 dwellings across Sydney were unoccupied on the night of the Census. It was also found that a higher concentration of vacant properties were found in inner-city suburbs, where rental yields are low.

The study concluded that the ability to negatively gear investment properties and receive large capital gains tax concessions incentivised investors to hold properties empty. This would explain why vacancies were higher where the capital gains on an untouched property exceeded the benefit of renting it out.

However, the evidence found may not support this conclusion, partly because properties have to be rented out or at least available for rent in order to receive benefits from negative gearing.

Representatives from the real estate sector claimed that the figure of vacant properties and its impact on affordability was overstated, as the data did not take into account properties that were vacant because they were on the market and people were in between moving homes. However, our data shows that on the night of the Census, there were approximately 6,100 properties listed for rent and approximately 14,200 properties listed for sale in Sydney. Listed properties are not necessarily vacant, but assuming they are, this would account for just 17% of the vacant properties estimated across the greater Sydney region on Census night.

It would seem that market activity cannot account for the majority of the vacant properties in Sydney’s metropolitan.

Housing Affordability: Baby Boomers vs. Gen Y

Inter-generational arguments over affordability have again become salient in the media. Characterisations of moaning millennials were made by economist Stephen Koukoulas[2], prompting a response from young writer Osman Faruqi that baby boomers should choke on my soy flat white[3].

Confusion around the severity of housing affordability arises because dwelling prices change daily, yet the institutional papers and ABS data we look to are retrospective.

The Submission to the Inquiry into Home Ownership by the Reserve Bank of Australia in June 2015[4] explored ownership rates as a possible proxy for understanding the severity of housing affordability, and whether expensive housing was keeping young people out of the market. However, the home ownership rates referenced are only measured to 2012 – before the enormous housing boom of 2013 – and therefore the submission paper does not take into account the largest and longest housing boom we have seen in over 30 years.

Graph 2 shows the House Price Index[5] for Australia’s eastern metropolitan markets over time. The increase in the HPI from 2013 (particularly in Sydney and other east coast markets) marks an unprecedented rate of growth in dwelling values.

Graph 2: House Price Index

Housing affordability is an undeniable problem in Australia today. It is measured using the ‘median multiple’, which is a measure employed by the World Bank. It is found by dividing median dwelling prices by gross annual median household income. An indicator of 5.1 or more is considered to be highly unaffordable.

We only have median household income data at a capital city level, up to 2012. To get a more accurate figure, I have indexed income by changes in average weekly earnings (from my October blog post) so I could work out the median multiples for each capital city. With the exception of Canberra, the median multiple is well above 5.1. In Sydney it is currently about 13.

The Interest Rate Debate

One of Koukoulas’ main arguments was that low interest rates have made it easier for young people to take out money to afford a home. He argues that baby boomers struggled with interest rates of over 17% in the 1980s.

While I don’t deny Koukoulas’ latter statement, it is important to get a better understanding of what low interest rates actually do to affordability.

Economics literature shows Australian’s have a high elasticity of demand for houses. This means that the more money people have access to, the more likely they are to buy houses. Low interest rates make the cost of borrowing money cheaper and access to money easier.

When interest rates are low, the cost of housing is bid up higher because more people are competing for housing. Graph 3 demonstrates the inverse relationship between interest rates and Australian median house values.

Low interest rates have not worked in the favour of first home buyers. In fact, in 2014, for the first time in recorded history and while the cash rate was at historic lows, more money was lent to people who were buying investment housing compared to people who were buying something to live in (see Graph 4). This unusual phenomenon eased shortly after APRA placed higher risk weights and investment lending restrictions on banks, however it does show that owner occupiers, some of which are first home buyers, do not necessarily benefit from low interest rates.

Graph 4: Loans to Investors vs. Owner Occupiers

Source: Onthehouse.com.au & ABS

Home owners also faced high unaffordability in the late 1980s when interest rates increased sharply and average home loans peaked at 17%. The cost of loans became extremely high and some were forced to sell their home or take on multiple jobs in an attempt to pay off their rapidly growing debt. On top of this, house prices fell, which left some people with mortgage debt even after they lost their home.

ABS data shows that the average loan size of owner occupiers in NSW over the 1980s was approximately $80,000, while the average interest rate increased to 17% in 1989. Assuming a 30 year mortgage on $80,000 taken out in 1989, the total repayments work out to be around $263 per week, at a time when the average person across NSW was earning between $359 and $620 a week depending on their job status and sex . The $263 home loan assumption represents between 73% and 42% of average weekly earnings at the time.

Today, standard home loan rates are at approximately 5.35%. In February 2016, the average loan size taken out by owner occupiers in NSW was $416,000 . With the same loan assumptions as above, weekly repayments work out at approximately $536 per week. In November 2015, the average weekly earnings across NSW ranged between $951 and $1,712, depending on labour force status and sex, making repayments between 56% and 31% of average weekly earnings.

This analysis is fairly ‘back of the envelope’, but looking at these numbers suggests that few owner occupiers today, nor many owner occupiers in 1989, could enjoy stress free and affordable weekly mortgage repayments – which is considered to be no more that 30% of income. Exorbitant home loan repayments persist 25 years on, but for different reasons. A surge in interest rates overwhelmed young home owners in 1989, whereas today many young people are lucky to overcome the deposit hurdle due to enormous dwelling prices. In the case of owner occupiers today, this is with the ‘benefit’ of low interest rates.

Ambiguity still exists in this comparison, for many reasons. For example, average weekly earnings is looking at individuals rather than households. Young people in the 1980s were more likely to have formed double income households than young people today. 1989 was a different world to 2016, particularly in terms of the nature of the economy, technology, job vacancies and the terms of employment.

However, a lack of affordability is not so much a generational problem as it is a socio-economic problem. Years of analysis could be done trying to understand ‘who had it tougher’, but this seems like a waste of energy. Low income households and single parent families will face tougher challenges than members of Generation Y who are in high income brackets.

"While it’s important that you hold an investment property for the long term to maximise your profits, there will come a time when it makes sense to sell.

And when it comes to selling, timing is everything. Ideally, you should be able to hold on to your investment property until such a time when it’s most conducive to sell.

That time is when:

The market is approaching its peak in terms of price growth
You want to consolidate your portfolio
The property is underperforming and you want to move your capital to better investments
You’re leaving your job and need the cash flow to fund your lifestyle
You’re facing financial difficulty and possible bankruptcy

When you’ve held your investment property for the past five years and haven’t seen significant capital growth, you’re essentially holding a dud property. In this case, you have to dump it. There are plenty of other markets where properties are growing dramatically.

You should also consider selling when the long-term demand in your market is declining or showing signs of slowing demand.

For example, if you bought in a regional area that’s main industry is mining, where the main employment is about to scale back on the workforce, you have to move fast and sell before the other properties hit the market.

The bottom line is if you do have to sell, the best time to do it is when people are willing to pay more than what your property is worth. Don’t rush to sell, but at the same time don’t hold out for too long. If you do, you may miss out and prices could fall before you’re able to sell.

Whatever your reasons, your aim should be to maximise your selling price. This means you should try and avoid finding yourself in a situation where you’re forced to sell.

 

Before you sell

Before you stick a for sale sign in the front yard, it’s important to be clear about what you want to achieve as a result of selling.

Here are a few suggested steps for you to consider:

Go over the pros and cons of selling your investment property. Selling is expensive so be clear about why you’re doing it.
Get a valuation to get an idea of how much is your investment property is worth.
Speak to your accountant regarding the capital gains tax implications of selling your property. Since this is an investment property, you will get a 50% discount on the capital gains tax if you have held this property for more than 12 months.
Speak to a property analyst or expert to gauge where your market is at now in the property cycle. You can also do the research on your own by looking at the property values over the past 3-5 years and see how they’ve performed. Start by researching a suburb here.
Plan your exit before you buy the property

Before you decide to buy a particular property, you need to have a strategy in place on how you exit it when the time comes or when the worst case happens.

For example, be clear about the triggers that would lead you to sell the property. Watch your cash flow like a hawk and keep an eye on your market.

Watch for any signs of changing market fundamentals and act decisively. Don’t let greed rule your head.

Put in place risk mitigation strategies such as hefty buffer in case you lose your job.

Before buying any property, always ask yourself:

Can I sell this in a hurry without losing money?
Who would buy it off me?

You should feel confident that if the worst case happens, you’re able to sell quickly without any losses.

"Let's face it. With the current sky-high property prices, it could take you a very long time to save the required deposit to buy your first home or your next property.

If you add that to the current tighter lending policies by the banks, you could be forgiven to think you’re doomed to be a renter for the rest of your life.

But don’t despair. There is hope. A little help from your parents can get you across the line.

Gift To The Rescue

By gift, we don’t mean something wrapped up in ribbons. By ‘gift,’ the banks mean any amount of cash that is not repayable. A gift can be given to you by anyone, but it’s normally your parents, grandparents or siblings.

Over 60% of first home buyers get some kind of help from their parents, typically a gift or a guarantee.

But There’s a Catch

Some lenders don’t accept a gift as a deposit!

The banks still need to see proof of ‘genuine savings’ if you don’t already own a property. That’s a deposit that you have saved yourself, which proves you are good at managing your money.

This doesn’t have to be an issue if you apply with the right lender, according to Otto Dargan, Managing Director with Home Loan Experts.

“Not every lender requires a savings history and some will waive the requirement for you to show you saved a deposit yourself if you can prove a rental history” he says.

Showing the Banks You’re a Money Master

“The best way forward is to apply with a lender that wants to work with someone like you. So, the first step is asking what you can provide to show you’re good with your money” says Dargan.

You can prove you’re good with your money using:

Gifts from parents that have been sitting in your account for at least three months that you haven’t spent.
Cash savings in your account over a three-month period or longer. Most lenders would like to see that you’ve accumulated your savings over a certain amount of time. That’s why they ask you to provide bank statements to see evidence of savings. They want to see that you’ve been able to retain your savings and also to see where it’s coming from. If they can see that you’re earning that money, putting money away regularly, say each week or month, then you’ve demonstrated your ability to save.
Shares that have been held for over three months.
Rent that you've been paying over a period. If you’ve been renting a property and you’ve been paying your rent to a property manager and not directly to the landlord, you could use their rental statement or ledger to show you’ve been up-to-date with your payments for the past 12 months or more. “This can count as your genuine savings even if you don’t have any cash in a savings account,” says Dargan.

The Devil is in the Detail

There’s a lot of grey areas with genuine savings. Tax refunds, inheritance and even bonuses from work can be considered in some situations.

However, the biggest grey area is with using a rental history as evidence of your money management. Some lenders only need a three month history, some will decline your loan if you’ve moved house in the last 12 months and most don’t like a housemate being on your lease! It’s complicated!

How it Works in Real Life

Using a gift as a deposit is pretty straightforward. All the bank requires is a letter signed by your parents saying that it’s a non-repayable gift. This means explicitly stating that it’s not a loan from them, but a gift that you don’t have to pay back.

The bank wants to know where the funds are coming from to complete the purchase, so your broker may want to prepare a coversheet explaining who’s giving the money. Then include a letter that will be signed by the parents saying something along these lines:

I, Joe Smith, am giving Henry Smith $30,000 as a non-refundable gift to help commit to the purchase of 1 Gerald Street, Smithfield, South Australia 5114.
Signed: Joe Smith

“As long as you can get over the genuine savings hurdle, the gift can be any amount that the parents are happy to give,” says Dargan. “The bank doesn’t verify anything about the parents, so you don’t need to provide much information about them. Their financial situation will not be scrutinised as the bank will just take this on face value and expect that this money will be available at settlement.”

When a Gift is Not Accepted

There are a couple of scenarios when a gift is not accepted by the banks:

When you don’t meet the genuine savings requirements of that lender
When the gift comes from someone else who is not your parent, sibling or friend

For example, if you’ve lived at home with your parents your whole life and haven’t saved much at all, even if your parents will give you a gift that will cover your entire 20% deposit, you may still be declined by some banks.

That’s because you’re not able to prove to the bank that you have the ability to save money or to meet regular ongoing repayments or commitments in the form of paying rents and so on.

The bank may also decline to take the gift as a deposit if it comes outside the parents, siblings and friends circle.

The reason is simple: It’s harder to prove that it’s a non-payable gift. Ultimately, the bank needs to believe that the person signing the letter is truly giving you the money without expecting a dollar back.

As you can see, there is a way to buy that home even if you don’t have enough cash in your savings account yet to cover the deposit. You can tap your parents’ resources to get out of the rent cycle. Just make sure you can check all the boxes for the bank.

"No matter how strong you may think your bargaining position is, there are many ways you can blow a property deal. This can occur, even in a buyers’ market, when you may believe you have the upper hand and it’s either your way or the highway.

Screwing Up Before Negotiations Begins

Without lining all of your ducks in a row, you’ll be under-prepared and unsupported to negotiate sensibly and confidently. Here are four ways to mess up negotiations before you even begin…

1. Not Doing your Research

When I refer to research in this instance I’m not talking about sales research (although that is important), instead I’m talking about researching the seller and the property itself.

The idea is to ask questions (usually of the selling agent) to learn as much as you can about the seller’s circumstances in the hope that what you glean will help you come up with an attractive proposition and strengthen your bargaining position.

For instance, you could offer a short settlement period or put in an attractive pre-auction offer if the seller wants a quick sale, or get a price reduction if you discover there are essential repairs to be done.

2. Not Setting your Limits

Whilst it’s important to understand the seller’s requirements, you also need to be clear on your own expectations and limits before you begin. Without setting your limits you may offer too much (and buy a property you can’t afford or, with hindsight, don’t really want) or not enough and end up losing the property.

From the outset, you must be clear on things like…

How much you’re prepared to spend
Your maximum settlement period
What you expect to be included in the sale (e.g. furnishings, plants, light fittings etc.)
Any other matters that are important to you

These items will comprise your key negotiating points and I suggest you list them out so you can compare how what’s been offered stacks up against what you’re looking for.

Related Article: Screwing Up During Property Negotiations

3. Not Making the Selling Agent your Best Friend

The selling agent is the person you’ll be negotiating with so don’t put him or her offside – you don’t want to start the process on the back foot.

Make sure you’re polite, courteous and punctual at all times. Your aim is to get the selling agent to view you as a serious buyer and someone they’d be happy to do business with.

4. Not Comparing Recent Sales

When negotiating on price, your position will be greatly enhanced if you base your offers on research, particularly recent sales in the surrounding area.

Using market evidence such as comparable sales strengthens your position and makes your offer more credible.

To help inform your offers (or your top price if buying by auction), you have a number of options to choose from:

Monitoring sales results for similar properties
Getting hold of free property reports from the major property research companies
Paying for an independent property valuation
Speaking to other selling agents (not involved in the sale) to get their take on what they think the property is worth.

"Tenants can unfortunately get a bad rap. Yes, there are going to be some nightmare tenants out there – who give the good ones a bad reputation. Maybe I have been lucky enough to not encounter a bad tenant in my long history of being a landlord, but I really feel there are some pretty common myths out there concerning tenants that aren’t entirely (or at all) accurate.

Myth 1: Tenants are Trouble

I recently found myself defending my reason for owning investment properties to someone who had a preconceived idea that all tenants move in and destroy the property. And, for this reason alone, this person was fearful of investing in residential property.

One of the best long term tenants I have had was a single mum. Her credentials weren’t great, but trusting the judgement of my Real Estate Agent – I approved her application. She remained in my property for just under 10 years and kept an immaculate house – treating it as if it were her own, and her rent was always paid on time.

For me, this myth is very far from the truth – the vast majority of tenants are great.

Myth 2. Tenants Expect Luxury

This is just flat out wrong. Tenants expect liveability.

It is natural for all of us to want to provide a safe living environment to our loved ones. Tenants want a house to be a pleasant place for them and their family to live, and they are usually realistic about what accommodation to expect within their budget. Comfortable living temperatures help.

Myth 3. They Will Move Out Anyway

Again, wrong!

Other than personal circumstances, most tenants vacate a property because they are unhappy with the managing Real Estate Agent or the owner’s inaction to their requests – they simply become dissatisfied with the property.

Moving is not fun, and it requires energy, time and money. Tenants dislike moving and they would be doing it for a particular reason. Tenants are usually open to negotiation if you want to ask them to stay, with improved terms and conditions.

This brings me to my next point: Good tenants are like gold!

Good tenants who stay in rental properties for long periods of time take away some of the stress of holding your investment. They treat your property well, keep it clean and pay their rent on time.

Once good tenants are established and they sign a long lease, that investment becomes a ‘set and forget’, which is the ideal arrangement for any investor as the property requires very little time and attention. Understanding your tenants and considering their needs is key to keeping the good ones long term.
 

Tips for Keeping Good Tenants


1. Good Management

Paying a competent Property Manager is essential. Good managers will look for tenants with good rental histories, and who are of stable character.

2. Tolerance

People have different personalities – some will be fussy, others more laid back and some are really messy. Experience helps with gaining tolerance of people, getting an understanding that they live differently and to varying standards of hygiene. So long as they are not damaging fixtures and fittings, a quick clean up after they vacate your property will be all that is required.

3. Listening

Ask your Property Manager to inform you of anything that is of concern to your tenants, particularly when they first move in and identify items they would like fixed for their comfort. Attending to small repairs quickly lets your tenants know that you care about their needs and the standard of your property. Understandably, a tenant will become frustrated if they are paying full rent and their concerns are ignored. Establishing a good relationship right from the get go helps keep good tenants longer.

4. Comfort

Provide good heaters for winter and ceiling fans for summer. Install insulation if needed to help regulate the temperature and to lower your tenants’ power bills.

Hint: Installing an air-conditioner provides an opportunity to ask for a rent increase and/or encourage a tenant to sign a longer lease. It also makes the property more appealing for future tenants.

5. Gifts and Thankyous

A ‘thank you’ and regular compliments will be appreciated by your Property Manager, as they have a busy and important role in looking after your investment.

Reward good tenants with small gifts e.g. movie tickets or shopping vouchers, especially at Christmas time, with a card saying ‘thank you for looking after my property’. This comes at a very little cost but can have a big impact on the way your tenants feel, often resulting in better care of your property and longer lease terms.

6. Respect

Rather than viewing tenants’ demands as problems, respect that their rent payment pays for YOUR investment, so addressing a few minor concerns is no problem. Consciously making this simple mindset shift can change attitudes and improve relationships.

Respect your tenants and look after them. After all, happy tenants will stay longer and good long term tenants are ‘set and forget’.

"Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has announced plans to change negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount if Labor wins the next federal election.

Under costings released from the Parliamentary Budget Office, Labor’s proposed changes could save the budget $32.1 billion over 10 years once they come into force.

Key measures include:

Negative gearing to be restricted to ""newly constructed homes""
Capital gains tax discount reduced from 50% to 25%
Both measures would come into force from July 2017
All existing investments under the scheme would be fully ""grandfathered"" and protected against the changes

With pressure on the current government to reduce the growing Budget deficit, and Treasurer Scott Morrison's refusal to rule out any changes in policy across the board, negative gearing would seem to be the one area squarely in the sights of both the government and the opposition, especially when you look at the statistics…

There are currently 1.2 million people who have negatively geared property, and most of these people are middle class Australians.
Australian Tax Office statistics show negatively geared property investors claim over $13 billion in losses each year, and the average loss per negatively geared investor is over $11,000
The average loss per negatively geared property doubles for people earning more than $180,000, to over $24,000.

Should our governments look beyond the numbers? Is it a false economy just to think that by tinkering with negative gearing it will solve the budgetary problem?

5 Reasons Why the Government Shouldn't Change Negative Gearing

1. Growing Population

With Australia's population set to grow significantly over the coming decades, our governments should be asking ""How will we house these people?""

The government does not have the capacity, nor the finance, to provide public housing for the growing population so this is left to the private sector.

Negative gearing allows more Australians to invest in property, as the tax benefits assist with the cash flow to invest and hold onto that property. If negative gearing is changed and CGT concessions are reduced, it will mean less investors, less demand and less houses, and it will place further pressure on the government to fund and provide housing.

2. Financial Pressures of the Ageing Population

There are currently 1.2 million middle class Australians investing in property to generate a capital gain and increase their asset base for retirement, to subsequently ensure that they can maintain a standard of living in their retirement without having to solely rely on the aged pension.

If the government creates a blockage into entry for property investment by chipping away at the tax benefits or reduce capital gain concessions, property investment becomes less attractive. In the long term, this will see more Australians relying on government pensions, meaning less self-funded retirees and therefore further pressure will be placed on future budgets.

The government needs to take a long term view and look beyond today. A change to negative gearing and capital gain concessions will only make matters worse in the future.

3. A Drop in Property Prices

Will a change in negative gearing and capital gain concessions disincentivise investors and, if so, what impact will this have on property prices?

In the short term, we may see a dip in property prices due to lower demand and increased supply – which will impact on the economy across the board. State governments will miss out on a large chunk of revenue (via loss of stamp duties), which could mean less funding to spend on things such as education, hospitals and infrastructure at a state level. The federal government will then have to fork out more to state governments to compensate.

4. Knock On Effect to the Economy

Will the changes deter people from investing in property?

Due to the loss of the tax benefits, people will not be able to fund the cash flow of an investment property, meaning they simply won’t buy investment properties. This will cause a knock on effect similar to what we have seen in the mining industry after the boom.

It could also mean a rise in unemployment in the building sector and associated industries such as white goods, electrical and service related industries like real estate and everything that goes with it. As previously mentioned, state governments will be impacted with less revenue from stamp duties to spend on state infrastructures – which would also mean less jobs.

5. Short Term Thinking

For all of the reasons above, I can understand why the government might look at the numbers in front of them and think changing the rules around negative gearing and capital gain concessions is a win for budgetary reasons, but it is simply a case of short term thinking. The government really needs to take a deep breath, sit back and carefully consider what impact this will have on the economy long term.

Any changes made may increase revenue today, but they – or should I say we – could end up paying for this 10, 20 or 30 years down the track. To put it bluntly, a short term gain for long term pain is not good business.

With 1.2 million middle class Australian property investors impacted, changing the rules are negative gearing and capital gains concessions would be highly unpopular – and it could be a game changer for either political party.

"In my recent article Four Ways to Screw Up a Property Negotiation, I talked about the ways you could mess up a property deal before you even begin negotiations.

To recap, if you are under-prepared and unsupported to negotiate sensibly and confidently, you could mess up negotiations before you even begin by:

Not doing your research
Not setting your limits
Not making the sleeing agent your best friend
Not comparing recent sales

Related Article: Four Ways to Screw Up a Property Negotiation

Following on from this, when you don’t establish the framework and ethics of how you will conduct your negotiation, it is possible to mess up a property deal during the negotiation and finalisation period.

Here are six ways you could screw up during negotiations...

1. Not Being Truthful

In order to enhance your negotiating position you might decide to “stretch the truth” a bit to give yourself the upper hand. This may take the form of overstating your financial capacity (suggesting you can afford more than you really can) or your level of interest in the property (appearing disinterested to try and get the selling agent to cut a deal).

Whatever your approach is, if you embellish your true situation, you’ll probably come to regret it because you’ll inevitably be found out. And when this happens trust goes out the door, as does your chance to buy the property you want. Remember, selling agents have long memories which may come back to haunt you down the track should you look to buy another property from the same agent.

2. Not Trusting the Experts

If you appoint a third party expert to advise and guide you, trust their advice. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t question it or get them to justify and explain their recommendations, but unless there’s a standout issue, let them do their job.

An example could be the use of a buyer’s advocate - someone who researches the market and specialises in negotiating on your behalf. If your advocate recommends a course of action or strategy then under normal circumstances it should be followed, especially if you’re a first time buyer or investor. The key here is to do your due diligence on the expert beforehand. And once you’re comfortable and they’re appointed, leave them to do what they’re good at.

3. Not Being Realistic

When negotiating you have to set realistic expectations about what you want to achieve, whether this be about price, making good on defects or what is and isn’t included in the sale.

In order to be realistic you need to set benchmarks on things like…

The market value of the property (by doing your research)
What you can afford and therefore your top price (by working out your spending power)
What the seller may be looking for (by asking questions of the selling agent)

It’s important to remember that if you make unreasonable demands this will undoubtedly turn off both the seller and the selling agent, which could result in them refusing to do business with you.

4. Not Truly Negotiating

A simple definition of negotiation is where two or more parties enter into a discussion to come to a mutually beneficially outcome. In particular, it’s about resolving points of difference so that everyone’s interests are satisfied.

To put this into a property context, the seller usually wants to get the highest price possible while the buyer wants to pay the lowest price possible. And if there’s a successful discussion, the end result will be a price perhaps somewhere in the middle but certainly where all parties are happy.

In order to achieve this you have to be prepared to give something in order to get something in return. The trick of course is to give something that has a high value to the seller, but a low value or cost to you. If you can’t do this, then you’re going to find it hard, if not impossible to negotiate to your advantage.

Screwing Up When Finalising a Negotiation

5. Taking Rejection Personally

If your offer or suggestions are knocked back, while you might be disappointed, don’t take it as a personal affront. And you should never make negative comments about the seller, the selling agent or the property if things don’t go your way.

Remember a “no” is all part of the process and you don’t want to burn any bridges as this may result in you being excluded from further discussions. Instead, stay calm and take everything in your stride. Remember, you can always make a counter-offer to see where it leads.

6. Not Looking for a Win/Win Outcome

The final point is about something that I alluded to earlier - having everyone walk away happy. This means you and the seller need to be satisfied that you both got a good deal.

To achieve this, you need to understand what the seller wants and how to deliver it. Importantly, it also means you have to be clear about what you want and that the seller understands this as well.

"Market Update

The latest data and analysis of the Australian housing market reveals an overall subdued or negative performance across the country. This is a likely result of a combination of things – such as restricted access to finance and sluggish economic performance, which in turn affects purchasing power and the confidence of buyers.

Table 1 presents the summary of growth, rent and sales data for February 2016, across the major housing markets.

Table 1: February Market Summary

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

Historically, it is common that the February quarter sees subdued growth that is below the long term average, however it is unusual to see a negative result. Quarterly growth in the Australian house market was -0.04% overall in February, while the unit market suffered a loss of -0.32%

Of the 32 major housing markets displayed in Table 1, 18 slipped into negative growth for the quarter. Of the markets that achieved positive quarterly growth, it was mostly subdued rates of less than 1%.

Interestingly, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane saw a reduction in median house values in the February quarter. This is likely the result of tightened access to home loans, which has encouraged a more rapid onset of the downswing in the east coast markets.

Melbourne’s growth cycles typically see two or three growth surges during the upswing stage, so this quarter’s retraction could just be a short term fluctuation.

The greatest capital losses for the quarter were again seen in Darwin, where the median house value dropped -5.68% and units declined -5.02%.

The key to this market is recalling its small size. Sales volumes across the Darwin market (houses and units) dropped 23% for the year, however the change in the number of sales was a decline of just 469.

Surprisingly, house and unit values in country Tasmania achieved the highest quarterly capital growth rates. The median houses value increased by 2.68% in the February quarter, while units went up by 2.00% in the same time period.

To put the various housing markets in perspective, Figure 1 shows the estimated dollar value of each capital city residential real estate market as at February 2016. This was achieved by using the average sale price of houses and units in the year to February 2016, multiplied by the number of sales in the metropolitan regions for the year.

Figure 1: Value of Capital City Markets

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

Noting the small size of Darwin’s housing market – a hundredth of the value of Hobart’s housing market – enables understanding of the high growth fluctuations occurring in Darwin. Because the market is so small, big projects and investments have a large impact on the economy, population and subsequent demand for housing.

This can also be seen when comparing dwelling growth with growth in private expenditure[1], which is represented by the dark blue line in Graph 1.

Graph 1: Darwin Growth Fluctuations: Houses & Units vs. Gross Fixed Capital Formation



Source: Onthehouse.com.au & ABS Catalogue Number 5206

Movements in private fixed capital formation tend to lead dwelling growth, though generally by a lower multiplier, particularly in the last 5 years. In turn, the changes in private fixed capital formation are influenced by resource projects.

With the construction phase of the mining boom over, economic growth and dwelling growth are likely to remain low or negative in Darwin, as the small, fluctuating economy stabilises.

In the quarter ending December 2015, private expenditure in Darwin suffered its largest decline in 20 years – which has led to significant dwelling declines in the first quarter of 2016.

Economic Update

February saw the release of important economic indicators from China, and the results are disappointing.

The Chinese Manufacturing ‘Purchasing Managers Index’ (PMI)[2] fell from 49.7 in January to 49.4 in February. Exports from China fell a whopping 25.4% in the year to February 2016, and bank lending also declined. These figures suggest a significant slowdown in the Chinese economy.

Economic performance of China is important. Not only does the nation comprise 15% of global GDP – it is also Australia’s largest export destination. Analysis from Moody’s March report revealed that approximately 8% of Australia’s GDP is dependent on China’s demand for Australian resources.

A report from the RBA analysing the changing consumption patterns in China suggests that food and liquefied natural gas imports would only partially offset a decline in metal ore imports. This suggests a reduction in export income over the next 10 to 20 years if demand for metal ores remain low.

The slowdown in China and global economic uncertainty is being felt in Australia. Annual wage growth hit at a record low of 2.2% in the year to December, which was narrowly above the annual inflation rate of 1.7%.

However, inflation does not take into account changes in housing costs.

It is likely that a higher portion of incomes are going to rent and mortgage repayments, given the exorbitant increase in a large number of dwellings across Australia – most of which are concentrated in Melbourne and Sydney.

All of this serves to slow down spending, which in turn slows down economic activity. For this reason, we may expect Australia’s housing markets to finally catch up with Australia’s subdued economic position.

In response to the uncertain economic conditions in Australia, the Reserve Bank may look at easing monetary policy. This may aid businesses with accessing credit, though the restrictions on home loans passed down from APRA late last year will serve to keep growth in housing subdued.

Therefore, 2016 may present opportunities as dwellings become slightly more affordable in capital city markets.

"I’m a big believer that property investment can be a worthwhile and rewarding experience.

Financially, it can provide excellent longer-term returns through capital appreciation while the monthly rental income can help offset property holding costs. Personally, you can get a lot of satisfaction and comfort knowing that if you’ve invested wisely your property can provide future financial security for you and your family.

However, all this doesn’t necessarily mean you must, should or are ready to become a landlord and undertake what may well be the biggest investment decision in your lifetime.

With ongoing media coverage about the level and direction of property values, strong auction clearance rates, strong median price growth in the major capitals and of course targeted marketing campaigns espousing the benefits of being a property investor, it is easy to get caught up in the excitement and opportunities this type of investment promises.

In addition, many potential investors may harbour the fear of missing out, which property marketers attempt to exploit. Their argument goes along the lines that if you don’t buy now, you may miss out forever. However, my advice is don’t get sucked-in by this marketing hype.

Before you commit to becoming a property investor (and I say commit because normally you’re looking at a 7-10 year investment timeline) here are ten warning signs that you might not ready…

1. You haven’t set your investment objectives

Don’t be a lemming and buy an investment property because that’s what others are doing. You should be clear about why you’re investing and what type of return you’re after. You also have to be ready, willing and able to take on the obligations of being a landlord.

The dangers of not being clear on your objectives include: 

You may choose the wrong property
Select the wrong loan product
Not know when to sell
And as result of the preceding points, you could lose money
2. You haven’t researched the market

There are many factors to consider when selecting a property and you should research these by property type and location. Without adequate research it will be difficult to identify and choose between properties most likely to deliver your investment objectives. Factors you need to consider include: capital growth potential, vacancy rates, rental returns and the cost of ownership.

Speaking to local selling agents, reading property articles and news feeds and subscribing to property reports from independent research organisations (like www.onthehouse.com.au) are great ways to improve your knowledge and understanding of the markets you’re considering buying into.

3. You’re convinced property investment is a sure thing

I hate to burst your bubble (no pun intended) but there is no guarantee that investing in property will meet your financial expectations. Prices can go down as well as up and they can remain flat or stagnant for many years. And remember, the property market can be broken down into various sub-markets including: national, state, suburb and street markets, all of which may interact with and diverge from one another (positively or negatively), depending on what’s happening from a macro or micro economic perspective. Never assume that investing in property is the right thing to because the only way is up. This is certainly not the case.

4. You don’t understand your legal obligations

When you invest in residential property you’re not only taking on the financial commitment of a long-term loan, you’re also taking on a number of legal responsibilities. Some of these include being a landlord, certain tax and reporting obligations or those of a company director if you purchase your property through a separate incorporated entity. Importantly, you must be aware of all your legal obligations to ensure you comply with the law because if you don’t, the consequences could be severe, such as being hit with a fine or worse.

5. You haven’t set a realistic investment timeframe

Don’t invest if you’re looking to make a quick buck. Sure you may have heard stories where lucky investors have managed to “flip” (that is buy and then quickly sell) a property within a relatively short period of time and make a profit (after taking into account all purchases costs including stamp duty), but these success stories are few and far between. And I think they’re more likely to arise from good fortune rather than necessarily good buying.

As mentioned above, you need to view your investment as a medium to long-term one – at least five years and more likely closer to ten. This investment horizon provides the time needed to recover your upfront purchase costs (which can add additional costs of anywhere between 3% and 7% to the purchase price) and provide the time needed to ride out any downward trends in the property cycle.

6. You don’t understand property cash flows

If you don’t understand the quantum and timing of your investment property’s cash flow then you’re asking for trouble. There are numerous stories of highly geared investors getting themselves into financial difficulty because they’ve taken on too much debt and eventually discover they can’t afford to meet their ongoing financial commitments. And this situation can be exacerbated if they’re negatively geared or if there’s a reduction in their household income where a reasonable portion of that income is needed to support their investment.

So don’t proceed until you’ve prepared a cash flow budget that you understand and that indicates you can afford the investment. And make sure you flex it to see what would happen in a worst case scenario. I would also suggest you set up a reserve fund to be used to help cover the unexpected – like an unforeseen major repair bill.

7. You’re not sure how much you should pay for a property

There are two big risks if you don’t know what you should reasonably offer for your investment property. First, you could end up paying too much (which costs you money) and second, by paying too much you could adversely affect both the level of growth and quantum of any capital gain you hope to make. In addition, it could add years to your investment timeline whereby you have to wait for the market to catch up to the price you paid, as well as cover all your acquisition costs.

So never put in an offer or sign on the dotted line unless you have a reasonable understanding of what a property is worth. This is where doing some legwork by attending open houses and auctions, speaking to local selling agents to get a sense of value and subscribing to independent property reports can pay real dividends.

8. You think negative gearing is a way to make money

This is another marketing ploy used by spruikers. Their argument is you can reduce your tax bill by losing money. Let’s just think about that for a moment…… You don’t make money by paying less tax as a result of a negatively geared property. You only make money if you’re able to sell your property for more than you paid for it plus (hopefully) what you paid out in interest and other costs less the rent you received over the period you owned it.

So you should think very carefully if the only way you can afford to buy an investment property is to lose money. From a loan affordability perspective, ask yourself this question, “What would happen if I lost my job or a big unexpected bill came in?” Just remember that if you can’t meet your ongoing investment property mortgage payments the benefits of negative gearing go right out the door.

9. Your don’t have the right investment structure in place

If you get this wrong it could adversely affect your personal tax situation including capital gains tax, the property’s overall investment returns and otherwise undermine the achievement of your investment objectives.

It’s therefore important that you focus on things like ensuring your property loan supports your investment strategy and that structure used to buy the property meets your personal, family and of course taxation needs.

10. Going solo

We’ve looked at nine examples where things can wrong, and thinking you can do it all yourself is example number ten. There are plenty of traps you need to steer clear of, whether you’re a novice or even a more experienced investor. For instance, you have to be across issues and risks encompassing: financial, property, tax, accounting, legal, insurance and even estate planning matters. Just bear in mind it takes years of training and experience and in most cases requires academic and professional qualification to be able to understand and/or provide advice on these matters.

You need to ask yourself, do I know everything I need to know? For most of us the answer is likely to be “no”. This is why you should always seek independent and unbiased advice before you invest.

Published: 23 March, 2016.",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,Ten Reasons You Shouldn’t Invest in Residential Property
"With the weather cooling down as we transition out of summer, don’t be fooled and think that the only ‘good’ time to sell your property is during the spring and summer months.

Sure, these seasons have proved to be the busiest and more popular times of the year to sell in, but the fact is that people buy and sell property all year round – the market doesn’t shut down just because it’s a bit cold or wet.

The time of year doesn’t necessarily determine when it’s the best time to buy or sell – typically other factors like interest rates, the state of the economy, consumer confidence and the cost and availability of housing stock are important factors that help determine the strength (or otherwise) of the residential property market. Additionally, sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances, you may have to sell outside of the traditional periods for reasons such as relocating for a new job or unforeseen changes to your family or financial circumstances.

Whatever the reason, don’t despair. Selling during the cooler months is not necessarily a disaster and can in fact provide a number of key advantages and opportunities if done correctly. Let’s start by taking a look at what are, in my experience, the top five major benefits of a winter sale…

Advantages of a Winter Sale
A big benefit is that anyone in the market during the colder months is more likely to be a serious buyer. After all, they could wait for the spring buying season to begin like everyone else but because they haven’t probably means they want to make a purchase before activity starts to pick up. And that’s good news for you.


Because stock on the market is lower during autumn and winter, you will have less competition to worry about. And having fewer sellers increases your chances of not only selling, but selling at the price you want because the buyer has less choice.


Another positive is that your selling agent may be more attentive. It will generally be a quieter period for them as well, so they will have more time to devote to your needs. Plus it will be a boon for them to bank off-cycle commissions which they can only do if your sale is successful.


If you were planning to buy in the spring, selling your home in autumn or winter may give you the peace of mind and flexibility other similar buyers may not have. For instance, you could bank your proceeds and negotiate without the worry that your old property is still on the market. This could give you a major advantage, especially if the seller wants a quick settlement.


Many people sell during summer and spring because they believe it maximises their property’s curb appeal. For example, their gardens are usually at their best, the interior and exterior colours are bright and there’s less of an issue about the house looking or feeling cold. However, you can turn this on its head by showing what your property looks like when the weather is at its worst. Examples include demonstrating that the heating system works, there are no structural leaks and that the house is warm and welcoming. What you’re saying to buyers is, this property is great in winter, imagine what it’s like in summer!

How to Put the Heat into a Winter Sale

You need to do the same sort of things to maximise your chances of a successful sale during the winter period as you would during the warmer months. However, there are five additional important steps you should take because of the time of year...

First and foremost, don’t think you have to drop your price just because you’re selling outside of the popular period. You do not have to discount for this reason alone. Do you research and take advice for your selling agent, but your property’s value should hold up no matter what time of year you’re selling.


Make sure your garden is neat and tidy. A lot of us neglect our garden during the colder months but this cannot be the case for a winter sale. You must make your garden look as good as possible and this includes the outside living areas.

You should also think about planting perennials. There are plants that keep their leaves all year round and even flower in the winter. This strategy is about giving your garden as much colour and lushness as possible, and to make it inviting – even in cooler conditions. Plus, you want it to look nice from inside your property so it can be enjoyed all year round.


Light is very important during winter. If you have a north facing property, you’ll have a major advantage. In any event, let as much light in as possible and think about how to use internal lighting (ceiling lights and lamps) to brighten up key rooms. Also, think about your wall, celling and floor coverings. Dark colours can work against you whereas lighter colours can lift a room and even make it feel more spacious. Decluttering and the removal of dark furnishings could also be a useful strategy.


Make sure all maintence work has been done. In particular, you don’t want leaking taps, leaking gutters or any water damage caused by a leaking roof or faulty window seals. Make sure excess water drains away from the property and there are no signs of puddles or external water problems. Basically, you want to demonstrate your property is water and wind tight. This could be a major selling point.


Last and by no means least, you should make your home as warm, cosy and inviting as possible. You want potential buyers to know what it’s like living inside when there’s inclement weather outside. This is really important for parents who will want their kids safe and warm inside when their rain or worse is going on outside.

"Jonathon Tepper, an American economist, believes that the Australian property market is in a bubble. His controversial report, which was published in the AFR and aired on 60 Minutes in February, has raised eyebrows and sparked heated discussions.

The word ‘bubble’ creates a vision of an ever expanding soap bubble or balloon, which finally bursts. But bubbles can also deflate, just like an old balloon.

The term ‘bubble’ originates from the South Sea Bubble back in the 1700s.

You are probably all aware of the famous bubbles in history. The most recent being the US housing bubble in the early to mid 2000s. We all know the repercussions of that one – the GFC (Great Financial Crisis).

Prior to that, there was the dot.com bubble in the late 1990s. We all know about that one too. And who hasn’t heard of ‘Tulip Mania’ in Holland in the 1630s?

Other famous bubbles include the British Railway Mania. This occurred in the UK in the 1840s. It came about as a result of the development of railroads, which in those days was a major revolution. Just as the dot.com era changed our lives, so did the development of the railroad back in the 1800s. Railroad stocks soared, but then tumbled.

Older readers may well remember the Poseidon boom in Australia in the late 1960s. It’s a long story, too long to talk about here. But in a nutshell, after a significant nickel discovery, shares in the small Adelaide-based company Poseidon NL soared from $1 to $280 within five months. But it wasn’t only Poseidon shares that went through the roof, it was all the so-called ‘penny stocks’, or ‘penny dreadfuls’ as they are often referred. As always the party ended. And when it did it took its toll. Not only on mining stocks but the repercussions were felt through the entire Australian economy.

I bet not many of you have heard about the ‘rhodium bubble’ of 2008. The price of this rare chemical element climbed from around $500 an ounce in late 2006 to $9,500 an ounce in mid 2008. It then fell back to $1,000 in early 2009.

These are just a few examples. Economic bubbles have been around 'since the birth of currency' as some put it. They are the result of human emotional factors that drive all markets: fear and greed. They can be sparked by excess monetary liquidity, or just rampant speculation.

They will never disappear from the economic landscape.

Jonathon Tepper is not alone in his thinking. Many will agree that the Australian property market is overheated. But not many agree with his forecast for a 50% decline in some areas. Bubbles do not necessarily have to burst, they can just deflate. That would be the ideal outcome for the market.

Sure, some areas are still overheated, but they do appear to be coming off the boil. That is not a bad thing. The good news is that there is evidence to suggest that investors are backing off. Once upon a time, most people bought houses to live in - not to seek capital gains. Maybe the pendulum is swinging back in that direction.

If the property market is indeed deflating, and I believe that it is, then it is a good time for baby boomers thinking of downsizing to do so. It’s a simple matter of maths, not a decision driven by fear or greed.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has announced it will hold the official cash rate at 2% in April.

This is the tenth consecutive month that the official cash rate has been left on hold, despite a persistently strong Australian Dollar (AUD) threatening a cash rate cut.

The AUD reached an eight month high of USD $0.77 early this week. The strength of the AUD is partly due to a global currency battle, where many central banks around the world are simultaneously trying to lower the value of their currencies relative to others, in order to attract more exports. This mitigates the ability of the RBA to devalue the currency in Australia through further cuts to the cash rate. Even though Australia’s cash rate is at a historically low level, it remains high relative to other countries such as in Japan, where rates are in negative territory.

Another boost to the AUD came from rallies in commodities over March. While most commodities are still well below the high levels in 2014, the last month saw increases in the index of natural gas (21.1%), iron ore (3.1%), coal (1.2%) and crude oil (1.1%).

Increases in price for Australia’s export commodities may help boost economic activity in the short term, as well as increase demand for the AUD, thus aiding its buoyancy.

Growth in resource revenues may have offset a need to try and reduce the currency value for April, which in turn may have contributed to the hold decision.

Further movements in the AUD, which will impact future cash rate decisions, will be contingent upon cash rate movements in the United States as the USD is a major currency competitor.

Other positive indicators coming from the Australian economy include an increase in the number of job vacancies, which trended up sharply by 3.1% in the February 2016 quarter. However, the robust nature of Australia’s economy in the face of increased job vacancies also depends on the skill level in the workforce and whether these vacancies can be fulfilled.

Another positive comes from the labour market, with the unemployment rate decreasing from 6% in January to 5.8% in February.

The Australian Industry Group’s Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) increased by 4.6 points in March, to 58.1 – its highest level since April 2004.

Recent optimism in Australia’s economy has come from increased activity in tourism, real estate and services, which is helping to offset losses in the resource markets.

I anticipate revenues in real estate will come down over the remainder of this year, but any further cuts to the cash rate may be dangerous in fuelling further debt rather than stimulating the economy.

Data from the ABS shows that Australia’s debt to income ratio rose in 2015, and Moody’s rating agency also reported that it expected a rise in the delinquency rate in home loans in 2016. This could keep pressure on the RBA to maintain the cash rate rather than lower it further.

Australians have a high elasticity of demand for housing. This means that the more accessible money is (through low interest rates for example), the more likely we are to divert this money into housing. This is understandable given that investors can take out large loans for houses. Additionally, houses have historically been perceived as a ‘safe’ asset, and real estate has recently been spruiked as picking up some of the shortfall from the declines in mining – making it seem like a strong source of growth. The RBA should be wary of fuelling further debt in Australia’s housing market, especially since it has generally been coming into a downswing period in capital growth.

The latest statistics on the major markets across Australia are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 presents the summary of growth, rent and sales data for February 2016, across the major housing markets.

Table 1: February Market Summary



Source: Onthehouse.com.au

Of the 32 major housing markets displayed in the table, 18 slipped into negative growth for the quarter. Of the markets that achieved positive quarterly growth, it was mostly subdued rates of less than 1%.

While a cash rate cut may temporarily help prop up further growth in the housing market, with such high levels of debt further growth would only lead to more pain in the economy down the track.

Many economists expect that the cash rate will remain at 2% until as late as May next year, as pressure on the housing market slowly eases and other indicators slowly improve.

"At some stage in our lives we’ll reach a point when it’s time to consider whether we should downsize to a smaller home. This important decision point can arise for a number of financial or personal reasons. More often than not, it’s because we’re heading towards retirement or the kids have moved out and the idea of moving into something smaller seems to make sense.

Whatever the reasons it’s important to weigh up the pros and cons of downsizing before you make such an important and significant decision. With this in mind, here are my top five thoughts on the ups and downs of downsizing…

The Five Ups

1. Financial Benefits

In simple terms, the larger your home, the higher household costs. You just have to check your utility bills and council rates to know what I’m talking about. Specifically, it costs a lot more to heat or cool a large home than it does a smaller one. And the same principle applies when it comes to other things like watering and maintaining a larger garden or running those electronic devices that seem to multiply when you have more rooms or spaces to fill. So by downsizing you can significantly reduce your overall household expenses.

2. Family Togetherness

Larger homes with multiple inside and outside living areas can provide mini sanctuaries that help us get away from life’s stresses. But they can also act to separate and segregate family members such that while they may be living under the same roof they’re not really living as a close and cohesive unit. A smaller home can help rebuild or strengthen the family bond by bringing everyone closer together.

3. Less Time Spent on Home Maintenance Chores

Most of us hate doing household work like vacuuming, cleaning, gardening and everyday maintenance, all of which eat into our personal and leisure time. These tasks also become that much harder the older and busier we get. While moving into a smaller home won’t eliminate these chores altogether, it will certainly reduce the time we have to spend on each thereby freeing us up to spend more time doing the things we enjoy the most.

4. Declutter 

The bigger our home the more stuff we own to fill those spaces like bedrooms, inside and outside living areas and walls. Downsizing a home presents an opportunity to downsize our belongings or declutter. Unnecessary items can be given to family and friends or donated to charity, sold to generate a bit of extra spending money or relegated to the tip. It’s amazing what we accumulate over the years and downsizing presents as an opportunity to get rid of those items we don’t really need or want.

5. A Fresh Start

Moving to a new property and location can be a bit daunting, but it can also be a great opportunity to start a new and exciting chapter in your life. New neighbours, new sights, new friends and new experiences could be just what you need to reinvigorate and reenergise your life and your relationship. If downsizing is viewed positively it can reap many long lasting rewards.

The Five Downs

1. Costs of Moving

While there may be some financial savings, there’ll also be financial costs. Things like the cost of selling (agents fees, marketing costs, legal costs) and buying (stamp duty, legal costs) and moving costs can add up to ten of thousands of dollars and these need to be taken into account when assessing whether to downsize from a financial perspective.

2. Finding Somewhere to Live

Conceptually downsizing can make sense but practically it can cause problems. It may not be a simple case of trading big for small because you may not be able to find the right type of accommodation (including aged care if that’s what you’re after), the right location or even an alternative that’s affordable.

With more and more people likely to downsize over the next ten years or so, demand for smaller properties in sought after locations can push the price up to prohibitive levels.

Furthermore, when you go small you may have to compromise. For instance, the downsized property may not be as “nice” as the family home and may not have the features you want, like having no garden as opposed to a smaller one.

3. Move Away from Family and Friends

Downsizing often means moving to a new location due to property affordability and availability. This can be hard especially if you’ve lived in your current home for a long time and have made life-long friends who you may not see as much because of the tyranny of distance. It can also be hard to move if you’ve currently got access to great amenities like transport, shops and recreation facilities which may not be to the same standard where you’re planning to go.

4. Emotional Pull

One of the biggest challenges of downsizing is breaking the emotional connection with the family home. There’s no doubt you may have spent many happy years and created some great memories, especially when kids are involved. The fear for many is that these memories may fade or not be reinforced if you move. I felt this way when I sold the family car after ten years. Our kids basically grew up in that car and we had many fond memories. For us it was a tough, but necessary decision to sell.

5. Unwanted Lifestyle Changes

When you downsize you may have to compromise on your lifestyle. For instance, you may lose the family pool, home theatre or a big backyard, and this can have a negative impact on your ability to entertain and do the things you enjoy doing.

In addition, you may find you need to move to higher density living meaning you’re closer to your neighbours and/or are sharing common facilities (like a driveway or garden).

And assuming you downsize the number of bedrooms, it makes it tougher to receive overnight visitors or welcome the kids back if they need to return to the family home for an extended period.

As a closing thought, it might be a good idea to discuss your downsizing plans with someone who has actually done so themselves. They’ll be able to provide some useful insights and help you avoid the problems and pitfalls they encountered.

Published: 8 March, 2016.",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,The Five Ups and Downs of Downsizing
"Whether you’re a first home buyer, investor and or looking to upsize or downsize, unfortunately, the answer is not as straight forward as you’d like. Speaking from personal experience, the best time to buy occurs when good planning meets good fortune – that is, being prepared and being in the right place at the right time.

To put it another way with reference to the famous aphorism often associated with the great golfer Gary Player, “the more I practice, the luckier I get”. When buying property this translates into the more you plan, prepare and research, the more likely you are to buy when the time is right.

To help with the planning and preparation side of things, I believe there are three important factors, each having three important questions you need to ponder…

1. Personal factors

a) Are you ready to take on the long term commitment and discipline associated with a home loan?

You need to be sure you can handle and stick to a budget and can make the necessary spending sacrifices in order to meet your monthly mortgage payments. This is as much about personal discipline as it is about sound financial management.

b) Are you ready to stay in one place for an extended period of time?

You have to make sure the location of the property is one where you can see a long term future and is somewhere you want to put down roots and be part of the local community.

c) Does the property meet your personal and lifestyle needs?

This is about finding somewhere that meets your practical needs (for instance property type, location, design, and layout) as well as your personal aspirational (such as a home that reflects a sense of achievement or a place where you can see yourself starting a family)

2. Financial factors

a) Have you prepared a budget?

You must work out how much you can reasonably afford based on your after tax family income. To do this you need to determine your borrowing power and your purchasing power which together will inform you about which properties are in or outside your price range. A detailed budget will help you do this.

b) Can you afford to borrow?

You have to make sure you can meet your mortgage repayments on time every time. This is where buying in a low interest rate environment can be helpful but you must be careful not to over-borrow just because finance is cheap. Remember rates can go up and you could be in for a nasty shock when they rise.

c) Have you saved a decent deposit?

A good sized deposit (which I define as at least 10% of the purchase price) will help reduce your borrowing requirements, provide for a buffer if things go wrong, and demonstrate to you and your lender that you have the discipline to make and stick to regular financial commitments – in this case, a savings plan.

3. Market factors

a) Have you taken into account seasonal factors?

During spring and summer there trends to be more stock on the market and therefore better choice. However, there is also more competition for quality properties. On the other hand, autumn and winter tend to be quieter periods with fewer sellers but also fewer buyers. So you need to determine when the best time for you to enter the market is and this could for instance, be when it’s a bit quieter.

b) Have you taken into account cyclical factors?

Property prices move in cycles – upturn/boom and then downturn/stagnation (or deflation if the market goes pear shaped). The trick is to buy near the bottom of the market and before prices peak, but of course this is hard to predict. So keep an eye on the general level and direction of property prices. You can do this by speaking to a number your Local Agent and accessing free online property reports provided by the major websites like Onthehouse.com.au

c) Have you considered the level and direction of median property prices?

This is about looking at the performance of specific suburbs and streets you’re interested in buying into, which may or may not follow the state or national trend (Use the free Suburb Research from Onthehouse.com.au). Again, do you research, follow sales results and speak with a number of selling agents for advice and guidance.

You may find you don’t have all the answers to these questions, and that’s OK for now. The important thing is to know what to ask and where to go to get help if it’s needed. So seek out trusted family and friends to get their advice and guidance, and use property research sites like Onthehouse.com.au to research properties, suburbs and Local Agents. Between them you should be able to find the answers you need to make an informed and timely purchase decision.

Published: 8 March, 2016.",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,When’s the Best Time for Buying Residential Property?
"If you are considering building your property portfolio, you may look to invest close to home or buy in areas you know or understand. While this all makes sense, there is a downside in that it can greatly narrow your choice. And, if you’re looking to buy in popular areas, you’ll be up against others that may force you to pay more than you should, or even worse, price you out of the market.

One option to help overcome this to cast a wider net and consider buying interstate. The table below shows that property investors have over 15,500 suburbs to choose from. And even within most states, there are literally thousands of suburbs available, meaning you may be able to stay within your state borders if you wanted to.

The principals of buying interstate residential property are just the same as buying locally although there are additional matters to consider. Here are my top five tips and hints to help you buy outside your own state…

1. Select your Property Wisely

It may sound obvious but you must apply the same disciplines when investing interstate as you would locally. This means you must consider and research the drivers of long term capital growth with a particular focus on those factors particular to the interstate region or suburb. Typically this will include considering things like population growth, infrastructure, the level and diversification of local industry and employment levels.

2. Research Online & Ask the Experts

It can be time consuming and expensive to research interstate markets yourself, especially if you’ve looking widely. For most of us it is simply not feasible to make numerous interstate trips to inspect properties and get a feel for an area. You could spend literally thousands of dollars on plane trips and accommodation without any payback.

This is where using the services of property research companies (like Onthehouse.com.au or Residex.com.au) can pay real dividends as they can provide independent research on suburbs, streets and properties as well a predictions on price and rental yield growth. The good ones will also provide economic and property updates on a state by state basis which provides useful macro-insights on where and where not to invest (like this Property News subscription).

In addition, you also need to identify a good Local Agent or Property Manager you can trust to manage the property on your behalf and deal with all those day to day matters that would be impractical for you to manage thousands of kilometres away.

Websites like Onthehouse.com.au can help find you an active and trusted Local Agent or Property Manager or you could start by speaking with estate agents who have a national network (they would also be helpful in providing interstate property advice)

3. Avoid Buying with your Heart

Don’t fall into the trap of buying interstate as result of a holiday. You might get seduced into buying because property is cheaper than your local neighbourhood. But if it’s cheap, it may cheap for a reason, so you need to remain objective in your decision making.

Another trap to watch out for is those idyllic interstate bush retreats – a tree-change holiday if you will. Again, you might have had a wonderful experience but it doesn’t mean buying such properties is a good investment. You also need to think about the risks of such properties, such as bush fires, accessibility and the likelihood of vandalism.

Another thing to be weary of are those free holiday offers from spruikers who promise to fly you interstate for free to check out one of their developments. Just remember there’s no such thing as a free lunch and you’ll pay for it one way or another, including possibly getting pressured into buying a property you don’t want and can’t afford.

4. Understanding State Property Cycles

Property values move in cycles and it’s not always the case that each state’s cycle moves in the same direction at the same time. For instance, some state markets may be ahead of others or may be moving in opposite directions. This is important to note because while you’re local market may be booming other markets may be heading south and they maybe one’s to avoid.

Again, this is where independent property research websites and businesses can provide guidance on where each interstate market is heading and where they sit in the current cycle. This information can prove valuable when discussing an interstate selling agent’s views on their market, especially if the two differ.

5. Make sure you do the Maths

Of course you have to make sure you can afford your interstate investment property (as you would any other property you buy) but you also have to be across the different costs of ownership as each state has different stamp duty and other charges.

In addition, you should factor in and be aware of what can and can’t be claimed for tax purposes. For instance, generally speaking you could claim travel costs to inspect you property however the tax office may take a dim view if it believes regular inspection costs are nothing more are than an opportunity to get a tax deductable holiday.

It’s best to speak with your accountant, financial and property adviser and get their guidance on how your tax, acquisition and ownerships costs may change if you buy interstate.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has announced it will hold the official cash rate at 2% in March.

The decision comes as global economic indicators continue to deteriorate. In January, the commodity price index dropped to a 10 year low of 83.1. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects a downgraded forecast for economic growth in 2016, to 3.4%.

The G20 Summit was held in Shanghai over the weekend, and international leaders were encouraged to pursue further expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. This was demonstrated by the People’s Bank of China, for example, which lowered the reserve requirement ratio for banks by 50 basis points today.

Australia however, is not yet falling in line.

There are sure signs of slowing in the Australian economy, which may call for a cash rate cut later this year. The national unemployment rate was 6% in February, up from 5.8% in the previous month, against a steady participation rate of 65.2%. The steady participation rate suggests that the rise in unemployment was due to lost jobs in the economy.

The increased precariousness of employment and the slowed demand in the economy may be seen in the January 2016 wage growth figures. Year on year, wage growth was at a historical low of just 2.2%.

Inflation at the December quarter was just 1.7%. While this is up from 1.5% in the previous quarter, it is still well below the RBA target band of inflation. This provides room for the RBA to lower the cash rate in the future.

Another sign of economic slowdown is across Australian housing markets.

January statistics from Onthehouse.com.au show that the median house value across Australia fell 0.81% in the last quarter.

The Sydney market is coming into the downswing period of its current capital growth cycle, with house values falling 1.19% over the January quarter. The strongest performing market for the quarter was Melbourne houses, where values increased 3.31%.

Capital growth in Melbourne is to be expected as this market historically follows Sydney growth cycles. Despite cyclical strength in the Melbourne market, most dwellings across Australia either experienced negative or very low growth over the last quarter.

The average home loan size across Australia also fell in December 2015, down 2.2% from the previous month. This would give the RBA freedom to decrease the official cash rate knowing that housing markets are coming off the boil.

While there is room to decrease the cash rate to stimulate demand in Australia, it may be that RBA Governor Glenn Stevens is saving this dwindling ammunition for a later date.

A low AUD also signalled that the cash rate might remain unchanged. The AUD closed at a low US$0.71 on Monday February 29. This followed a sharp drop in the AUD last week. A low AUD takes pressure off the RBA to induce lower currency through a cash rate cut.

Currency remains an important factor in RBA decision making. Some speculate a future cash rate cut based on statements made by RBA board member John Edwards, who argued that “if [the AUD] was driven entirely by commodity prices, it certainly should be lower”.

There are some signs of resilience in the economy. The Australian Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) increased by 2 percentage points to 53.5 in February of 2016, from 51.5 in the previous month. However, much of the confidence and economic resilience in Australia has come from construction and real estate, which has partially offset a decline in mining.

As the construction and real estate sectors begin to come into downswing, there could be further economic challenges and a subsequent cash rate cut in 2016.

"When buying an investment property, is purchasing one that is already tenanted a good idea? The short answer is usually yes because after all that’s what you’re after – someone to support your cash flow by helping you meet your monthly investment loan repayments. But buying a property with a tenant can have some downsides as well as benefits and so you need to take some important steps before you sign on the dotted line.

Before we look at these steps let’s take a look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of buying a tenanted property:

Advantages
The first and most obvious one of course is that you get immediate rental income. This will help your cash flow management as you won’t have to worry about any vacancy period – you get cash in day one.


Secondly, because you have a tenant you don’t have to spend time, money and effort finding one. This will save on advertising costs and the worry that your investment is not generating cash flow. You may also save on cleaning and related costs since there is no need to prepare the property for viewing.


Finally, there’s a certain level of comfort knowing your investment is relatively secure – you have a tenant (hopefully a long-term one) and your core focus can be on establishing a good relationship with him or her and maintaining your property.
Disadvantages
While existing tenants offers security, it also means you’re stuck with them until the lease expires. This could be problematic if you have unsuitable or demanding tenants or you want to increase the rent, which you can only do if permitted by the lease.


Aligned to this is where you may wish to undertake renovations or repairs. This could be complicated by the terms of the lease and you may have to pay the tenant compensation for any inconvenience or lack of access to the property if you decide to proceed.


Finally, you may have inherited a lease that is about to expire or tenants who are off-lease meaning they can vacate at short notice. In either case you may find your property becomes vacant very quickly and you’re back to square one.

10 Steps to Protect your Investment

Before you proceed to buy your investment property, here are 10steps to help minimise your investment risks…

1. Review the lease in detail and seek independent legal advice.

Make sure you understand all the terms and conditions and what is and isn’t included. For instance, you need to check on things like the length of lease, how and when rent may be increased and renewal options. You also need to be clear about what is and isn’t included in the lease payment. For example, some lease payments are all-inclusive covering things like utility, garden and maintenance and even internet costs. It’s important that you understand who is responsible for what outgoings. This is very important for budgeting and cash flow management.

2. Talk to the managing agent and find out what sort of tenant you’ll inherit.

Ask questions like: Do they pay on time? Are they in arrears? Have there been any problems? Have they been looking after the property? Have inspections revealed any issues?

3. Make sure you inspect the property.

Not only will this reveal its general state of repair but it will also give you a sense of how the tenants live and maintain the property.

4. Check rental yields for the street and suburb and compare them to the one you are considering.

Look for any major variances remembering that you won’t be able to increase the rent until the end of the lease.

5. Investigate whether there are any additional agreements or arrangements, particularly verbal ones, in place.

For instance, check whether the current owner has agreed to say, upgrade the kitchen, paint the house or undertake repair work. These may become your responsibility if you buy.

6. Check the bond has been lodged properly to ensure it can be transferred to your name on settlement – a check this actually happens when settlement occurs.

7. Query how often the property is inspected and make sure you are comfortable with the frequency and outcomes of each inspection.

For instance, are they occurring often enough and are they revealing any problems?

8. Compare the property condition report to your own observations.

Is it accurate? If you have any doubts, bring in the experts and arrange for an independent property and/or pest inspection.

9. Investigate the performance of the Property Manager.

Have they done a good job and have they been attentive to the needs of the current owner? You can learn more by speaking to the current landlord and jumping online to do your own research. Remember, if you’re not happy you can always change agents.

10. Don’t be seduced into buying an investment property just because it has a tenant.

Remember, your decision to buy must be based on sound property fundamentals.

"As 2016 is well under way, most of you have probably set your financial goals for the year ahead. BUT, how many of you have stopped and analysed your home loan?

While your home loan might be the best fit for your circumstances, smart planning can help you gain financial freedom faster. By giving thought on how you service your loan, you could be paying off your loan quicker - which also means you will pay much less interest over the life of your loan!

Repay Your Way to Financial Freedom…

If you can make extra repayments on your home loan, you can shave years off the term of your – which means you will save on the amount of interest you pay. That is, the more principal you can pay off by putting extra funds into your loan, the more your repayment will go towards paying off the loan rather than being dedicated to servicing the interest.

Many banks will allow you to make additional repayments on your loan at no extra cost – and you don’t necessarily have to wait until you save enough for a lump sum payment. By simply changing your repayment frequency from monthly to fortnightly you will already be paying off your loan faster – as you will be making 13 full repayments in a year as opposed to 12!

A repayment calculator is a simple tool that helps make your home loan decisions easier. You can calculate your repayment amount by simply putting in the desired loan amount, term of the loan and the interest rate. What’s more – see how much time and money you can save if you choose to make additional repayments on your loan with an additional repayment calculator.

If You Need the Extra Money…

A valid concern of many mortgage holders is that if they make additional repayments on their loan, their savings are impacted and that they won’t have any reserve funds if something unexpected occurs.

The good news is, many lenders offer redraw facilities on additional repayments made, or they give you the option of an offset account linked to your loan – which allows you to withdraw any additional money (extra repayments) as required.

Both a redraw facility and offset account help you pay off your loan faster, but they are two different features and it is important to understand how they are different…

A redraw facility allows a borrower to redraw the additional repayments made against the home loan. For example:

Jessica has a 25 year term home loan of $300,000, with an interest rate of 5.5%. Her monthly repayments are $800, but Jessica elects to pay an extra $100 a month off her loan – meaning her additional repayments total $1,200 over the year. These addition funds are used as an emergency fund – where Jessica can draw from if needed. If Jessica continues to make an extra payment of $100 each month, and does not use her redraw facility, she will save $29,917 and 2 years and 6 months off the life of her loan.

Remember, different banks provide different offers. Many lenders offer a redraw facility for free but some may charge up to $50 per redraw. There could also be a limit on the number of free redraws and the amount you can redraw in a year, so make sure you compare different lenders and loan products so you can choose the best option to meet your circumstances.

An offset account is a savings account linked to your home loan. Any amount you keep in this account is offset against your loan amount, reducing the interest paid on a daily basis. Thus, the more money in your offset account, the less interest you pay overall. For example:

John has a 25 year term home loan for $300,000 with an interest rate of 5.5%. He opened an offset account linked to his home loan. John received $10,000 from his parents as gift and deposited it in his offset account. If John doesn’t withdraw this amount, he will save $27,634 and 1 year 3 months on his loan.

The key to fully utilizing this feature is to keeping a good amount of money in your offset account. Consider moving all of your savings into your offset account, or ask for your salary to be directly paid into your offset account. This way, you can maintain a high balance for the maximum number of days.

Which Option is the Right Option?

Though the function of a redrawn facility and an offset account seems the same, the choice on which is right for you depends on your financial condition and goals.

An offset account is suitable if you have a stable income and can maintain a substantial balance in the account. On the other hand, if you think you have extra money now and would rather build up a fund for the future, a redraw facility could be more suitable for you.

Don’t forget to consider the purpose of your savings. Using the amount redrawn from an investment loan for non-investment (or personal) purposes means the interest on that amount is no longer tax deductible. You can use the money you withdraw from an investment loan offset account for non-investment purposes without losing the tax benefit; but we recommend you consult an expert before doing this.

"Let's take a moment to review what happened in 2015, to see what lessons were learnt and how they can help with your property investment plans for 2016.

1. Interest Rates

Interest rates have a significant impact on the property market. Even though the official cash rate has been in decline since November 2011 and remains at a historical low 2%, the banks increased interest rates on investor loans towards the end of 2015, in response to the pressure from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to increase stability in the sector. This had an immediate impact on the property market, with auction clearance rates dropping almost overnight and it took the sting out of the property market.

The US recently raised interest rates, and the UK followed shortly after. However, Australia may not yet be at its trough in the interest rate cycle.

2. Banks Have the Power

When the banks increased rates on some of their loan products, we saw the impact this had on the psychic of the property investor. However, they also pulled the strings on how easy it is for property investors to access finance.

In 2015, the banks tightened lending criteria by increasing deposit requirements on some loans from 10% to 20% a – or in some cases more, which in itself is good governance as it provides a higher buffer in the event of a property downturn. With so many 'off the plan' sales settling in the next couple of years, and with a possibility of lower prices on completion, the banks are protecting the consumer and themselves at the same time. With the Global Financial Crisis still fresh in the mind of lenders, and if 2015 is a guide, we may see the banks further tighten their lending policies.

3. Do Your Research

The latest market update from Onthehouse.com.au shows that the Sydney and Melbourne property markets enjoyed strong capital growth in 2015.

The update reported that, as 2015 wrapped up, so did the Sydney housing boom – with the upswing in the cycle lasting almost two years, increasing the median value by approximately $375,000 in real dollar terms.

Historically, Sydney has been the leader of growth and the Melbourne and Brisbane markets would generally follow. Based on the research, the Melbourne house market could peak sometime in the first quarter of 2016 while Brisbane could follow later in the year. However, global economic trends and a national crackdown on speculative buying may hamper growth for these other east coast cities.

With Sydney and Melbourne being at the top of their growth cycles – keep in mind that there are opportunities in other markets, particularly if you are looking for a lower entry point and good capital growth. Personally, I would consider looking at markets in different stages of their growth cycle, where there is room for improvement.

This year is likely to see difficult economic times across Australia. While there may be a continuation of growth in Melbourne and Brisbane, and some short term upswings in Perth over the next quarter, investors and home buyers should keep in mind the long term growth fundamentals of a market.

4. The Negative Gearing Debate

What is the government going to do about the Budget Deficit? Raise taxes, increase the GST, change policy?

Currently 1.2 million people negatively gear property and most of these people are middle class Australians. The Australian Taxation Office shows that the value of negatively geared tax breaks claimed by investors is around $13 billion, with the average loss per negatively geared investor being in excess of $11,000. This loss doubles for those earning more than $180,000 – to more than $24,000.

Previous governments have 'huffed and puffed' but never blown the house down when it comes to policy change in this area. However, governments also realise that anything done in this area will be highly unpopular amongst middle class Australian voters who will be the vast majority of people affected.

I don't believe that the government really knows how these changes will impact the property market, so their attitude in the past has been to leave it alone. But, this Malcolm Turnbull led government facing a Budget Deficit blowout expressed the need to review the negative gearing policy and may have little choice but to tinker with negative gearing in 2016.

5. The Changing Landscapes of Australia and the Property Market

Australia, by world standards, is still a small country. According to the latest ABS data, the population has clicked over 24 million. World Bank data records that population density is roughly three people per square kilometre of total land area, however with 89.01% of the population living in urban areas, Australia is one of the world's most urbanised countries. The total life expectancy at birth for Australians is currently 82 years, which is among the highest in the world. The latest ABS population growth figures reveal Australia's population grew by 1.4% during the year ended 30 June 2015. The population is projected to increase to between 36.8 million and 48.3 million by 2061.

In 2015, the cities of Sydney and Melbourne were compared with other large cities of the world like New York, Paris and London. We have seen a surge of new high density high rise development in our cities over the last year and this will need to continue to accommodate our growing population. The great Australian dream of owning a quarter acre block is not quite over yet, but we will see a change of demographics over the coming decades to adjust to high density apartment style living.

"The number of first home buyers in the Australian market continues to fall away as a growing proportion of the population continue to lose hope of achieving the great Australian dream of owning your own home. 

The situation is likely to get much worse for the next generation of aspiring home owners as property prices continue to rise and loan affordability becomes problematic.

A recent study conducted in the United Kingdom demonstrates the problems faced by first home buyers in the UK property market, which reveals alarming similarities with the situation here in Australia.

A report released by the Resolution Foundation[1] concluded that the dream of home ownership for many first time buyers in the UK was effectively dead and buried.

Using the Bank of England figures, the report indicated that around 46% of non-home owners surveyed believed they would never own their own home. And don’t think this 46% was confined to only the poorest in the nation, because it wasn’t. Around 25% of high income earners in the same cohort also felt the same.

Major Problems for UK First Time Buyers

The main reasons cited among those surveyed included:

High property costs (46%)
Mortgage affordability (33%)
Maintenance costs (10%)
Lack of access to mortgage finance (32%)
Concerns about job security (13%)

The report also highlighted that it would take around 24 years for a low to middle income earning household to save a deposit.

I’ll just let that sink in for a minute. That’s 24 years! So for those in the UK who start saving in their mid to late 20's, they’d be in their early 50's before they could buy! No wonder so many peoplpe across the pond have lost hope of ever owning a home.

So, what does this have to do with the great Australian dream of owning your own home?

First Home Buyers in Australia Face Similar Obstacles

There are a lot of similarities between the report findings when compared to the challenges and obstacles faced by today’s FHBs here in Australia, particularly around affordability and home loan serviceability.

While the ability to save a deposit is not as severe as in the UK, the deposit gap is an ongoing issue that is likely to worsen as house prices increase and major home loan providers tighten their lending criteria.

And then of course we have the spectre of increasing interest rates.

For example, the charts below show the decline in FHB activity in the Australian market between October 2014 and October 2015.

 

As you can see by the charts, the percentage of loans to FHBs dropped from 17.0% to 15.1% between October 2014 and 2015. And, when it comes to the value of home loans, FHBs are getting deeper and deeper into debt as average loan sizes continue to increase - the average loan size taken out by FHBs was $356,000 in OCtober 2015, which is $36,000 (11.25%) higher than it was in October of the previous year. Furthermore, this has occurred during a time when home loan rates have been at historical low levels. 

Why the UK experience is important for Australia

Australia and UK share many similarities when it comes to home ownership.

For instance, both countries have a high-home ownership rate (around 67%), both try and give everyone a reasonable chance of buying their first home and both countries rely heavily on mortgage finance as a means to purchase property and follow a similar process when it comes to conveyancing. However, there are also some big differences - particularly when it comes to land size and population...

Country	Population	Land Size (sq. km)	# of People per Square KM
UK	64 million	244,820	248.3
Australia	24 million	7,687,000	3

Source: alldownunder.com

As the above table indicates, Australia is a substantially larger country than the UK in terms of land mass - being around 31 times,  but has 40 million fewer residents.

Significantly and not surprisingly, our population density at around three people per square kilometre is around 1% of the UK’s 248. However, it is worth remembering that Australia is classified as having an arid and semi-arid climate, with around 18% of its land mass being desert.

If we were to equate the UK’s population density to Australia, it suggests, on a like for like basis, that we should be able to support around 1.6 billion people.

Of course this comparison is simplistic and unrealistic, but I think a reasonable person would recognise that whatever the number is, we should be able to adequately support and provide affordable home ownership for a lot more people than we do today - if we had the right housing strategies and policies in place. After all, we don’t have the same land and population constraints as the UK – or many other countries for that matter.

The Way Forward

There is wide spread recognition by the public, politicians and the media that Australia has a FHB housing problem, which is likely to get much worse for the next generation of aspiring home owners as property prices continue to rise and loan affordability becomes problematic.

The reality for many young (and not-so-young) renters, home ownership will never happen. My sense is that we are already well down a similar path to that in the UK and we need to change direction. Increasing housing supply has to be a key objective for our political leaders.

Of course there are social, environmental, political and financial considerations that need addressing (to name but a few) and the problem is not going to be solved overnight. But now is the time to make a start so we don’t find ourselves in a situation where a growing proportion of our population has no hope of becoming a home owner.

"When buying a property, it's important to understand the upfront and ongoing costs.

 

Upfront Costs

Purchase Price

This is what you’ll pay to purchase the property and unless you’re paying outright, it’s likely to include money you’ve saved and money you’ve borrowed.

Lenders will generally ask for a minimum deposit of 10% to 20% but others may lend to you if a family member pays the deposit, signs as guarantor or buys the property with you as a co-owner.

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission says aiming for a deposit of 20% or more of the purchase price, plus enough to cover added costs[1], is a good goal. Also, contact your state revenue office about grants for first home owners.

Government Fees

Stamp duty is a land/property transfer tax applied by all Australian state and territory governments.

It is one of the most significant upfront costs you’ll have to pay and it can vary greatly depending on where your property is located.

Mortgage registration and transfer fees also apply and differ from state to state.

Calculators Australia has a stamp duty calculator which may be able to help and, if you’re a first home buyer, visit your state government website to see if you’re eligible for stamp duty concessions.

Depending on your personal circumstances, the value of the property and the type of property, you may be exempt from paying stamp duty so be sure to do your research.

Legal and Conveyancing Fees

When buying property, engaging a real estate conveyancer or solicitor that specialises in conveyancing[2]. is often a good idea. They’ll prepare the documentation and conduct the settlement process.

The costs will vary depending on the property you buy and the person you use.

Loan Application

This is also referred to as an establishment, up-front, start-up and set-up fee. It is a one-off payment to your lender when your loan commences. Fees can vary depending on your provider and will cover things such as credit checks, property appraisals and basic admin.

AMP currently waives these fees on most of our home loans, however some conditions apply.

Lender’s Mortgage Insurance

When applying for a loan, you may also have to pay lender’s mortgage insurance — which is a type of insurance that protects the lender from borrowers who can’t repay the loan. If you have a deposit equal to or more than 20% of a property’s purchase price, generally you won’t be asked to pay this insurance.

Building, Pest and Strata Inspection Reports

These inspections will alert you to structural problems or defects that may not be visible to the eye — asbestos, termites, electrical, ventilation and plumbing faults.

A strata report, if you’re buying a townhouse or apartment, can tell you whether the property is well run, well maintained and adequately financed.

Moving Costs

If you plan on moving into the property rather than renting it out, moving costs can vary depending on distance, if you rent a van, ask your mates to help or hire a professional removalist.

Ongoing Costs

Loan Repayments

You need to pay back what you’ve borrowed and some loan providers may have facilities to help you keep charges down or access money you’ve repaid if you need it.

You may also want to consider using an offset account if your lender offers this. It is a transaction account linked to a home loan to help reduce the interest payable against your outstanding loan balance.

How much you pay back and how often you make repayments will affect how long it takes to pay off your home loan. Our Loan repayments calculator can help you crunch the numbers.

Interest Charges

You’ll pay interest on the money you borrow so it’s a good idea to compare what different lenders can offer and to check out the comparison rate.

You can generally choose a fixed or variable rate, or a combination of the two. This is worth some research as it can make a big difference to your repayments, particularly if interest rates move up or down.

Other Ongoing Expenses

Strata fees for communally managed properties
Council rates
Utility costs — water, gas and electricity
Building and contents insurance
Any optional home improvements
Property maintenance and if you’re leasing out your property — property management.

Buying a home is exciting and a big financial commitment. AMP offers a range of home loan options that might suit you. We’re here to help and our home loan specialists will be there to guide you through the process.

"Market Overview

Table 1 shows the capital growth, rent and sales summary for January 2016.

Table 1: January 2015 Summary

Source: Residex

As discussed last month, it is evident that the Sydney market is coming into downswing. Annual growth in the Sydney house market was 14.76% in January, which is down almost 4 percentage points from the previous month. Quarterly growth in Sydney house values was -1.19%, bringing the median value down to $1,046,000 from $1,065,000 in the previous month.

Also notable is a sharp quarterly fall in the value of Darwin houses, falling a whopping 4.05%. This has dragged annual capital growth in this market down to just 0.91%. The Darwin unit market was the worst performer among the capital city markets over the year to January, with the median value falling 6.00% to $392,000 for the year.

Like the Perth market, Darwin has been susceptible to divestment from mining, due to the economic dependence on resource exports. Exports in Darwin accounted for approximately one third of economic output in 2014, compared to a national average of approximately 18%. Since the sharp fall in commodity prices, the value of Darwin houses are steadily coming down, and units more markedly so. At January 2016, units in the Northern Territory were at their lowest value since March 2012.

The global confidence crunch will likely impact the NT economy in the short term. Until there is significant development in the tourism sector, or an improvement in the international economy, subdued economic growth may translate to further loses on dwellings in the NT in 2016.

Steady performance in Melbourne was expected, as the market is likely to come to a peak growth rate sometime in 2016.

The standout performer in the year to January was Hobart houses, where the median value increased 4.15% to $388,000. Tourism had a positive impact on this economy in 2015, with the number of visitors to Tasmania increasing 7% in the year to September 2015, while visitor expenditure increased 10% to $1.92 billion. Within Australia, visitors from New South Wales saw the largest increase (14%), likely driven by the strong wealth effects from a rapidly growing housing market.

This year may see steady capital growth in Hobart houses, however due to stagnant rental yields and economic threat from bushfires and government debt, the growth experienced may not be as strong as it was in 2015.

Structural and environmental factors continue to shape the growth in our housing markets. The last few weeks have been dominated by discussions around reforms to negative gearing. In case you are not totally familiar with the subject, here are my thoughts… 

A World without Negative Gearing

In a surprising political move, the Labor party has outlined the reforms to negative gearing they would implement if they are the elected government. The policy involves removing the ability to negatively gear established investment properties from the 1 July 2017. At this time, anyone already holding a negatively geared property may continue to do so. This is known as ‘grandfathering’.

Anyone wishing to negatively gear after 1 July 2017 would have to buy new properties to do so.

In response, the Turnbull government indicated they may leave the tax parameters untouched, but it is not entirely clear what the government’s stance on negative gearing is.

Several barriers exist for the reformation of negative gearing. Firstly, Labor would have to be elected. Running on the basis of changes to negative gearing may not be popular. ABS data reveals that two thirds of Australian households either own property outright, or are in the process of paying it off.

With reforms to negative gearing potentially lowering dwelling prices, capital gains and equity in the family home may be threatened for many, making it an unpopular decision.

Secondly, negative gearing has been increasingly influential in encouraging investment in property, increasing property values and generating large revenues for the real estate and construction sectors.

Over the year to June 2015, construction revenues grew a significant 13%, and real estate services grew 9%. These were the largest increases of any sector in New South Wales, contributing to almost 30% of growth in the NSW economy.

This is not to say that the real estate services and the construction of houses are the most sustainable or productive ways to boost national economic growth. Sydney’s property market appears to be coming into a downswing in its current cycle, which will make it very difficult for these sectors to maintain the same levels of revenue and employment as in the last few years.

The peak and potential downswing in the Sydney house and unit growth cycles are shown in Graph 1. Growth in the current cycle appears to have peaked in late 2015, with growth rates beginning to come down sharply since this time.

Graph 1: Historical Capital Growth Rates, Sydney  

Source: Residex

Negative gearing also presents an increasing constraint to the government budget. According to Australian Taxation Office data, there were approximately 1.26 million landlords negatively gearing in the 2012-13 financial year. These investors claimed over $12 billion in losses in that financial year.

Academics and economists have argued that negative gearing contributes to unaffordable house prices, along with capital gains concessions and high levels of finance relative to other assets.

As arguments for housing affordability become more salient, policies like Shorten gains popularity. Thus it is well worth considering what consequences (intended and unintended) the policy would have on Australia’s housing markets. 

This is difficult to do, because a counterfactual does not exist. A ‘counterfactual’ is a scenario where the thing you are measuring does not exist. If you think about it like a science experiment, we do not have a ‘control group’. Housing markets have performed with negative gearing in place, as we know it today, for over 30 years.

The only thing near a counterfactual available, one consistently referred to by journalists, was the brief period between the July 1985 and September 1987 where negative gearing was temporarily quarantined.

I was not alive at this time, so I do not know the Hawke-Keating policy intimately, but there are several reasons I do not think it is an appropriate indication of what may happen if Shorten’s proposal comes into play.

As with the Labor proposal, the Hawke-Keating government ‘grandfathered’ negative gearing in houses. Unlike the current Labor model, rental losses could still be deducted, but only from income that was made on property. Losses in one year could be deducted from the income received on property in another year. This was applied to both established and new property, but only on new purchases.

Graph 2 shows the capital growth rates in houses during this time in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, as indicated by the shaded area.

Graph 2: Historical Capital Growth Rates: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane  

Source: Residex

There does not appear to be any causal relationship between changes to negative gearing and capital growth movements in this graph. While it is true that growth rates here are subdued, the market was also in a cyclical downswing at this time.

Should we take this to mean that dwelling prices would not be affected by changes is negative gearing?

Consider the difference in this period in Australia’s housing markets: it is likely that there were a lot fewer investment properties in 1985-87 than there are today, as the purchase of investment properties has increased in Australia over the last three decades.

This is partly because the ability to negatively gear rental properties against salaries and wages was only introduced six months before it was temporarily repealed in 1985, and it was not until the mid-1990’s that individuals could leverage their property to buy more property without having to come up with any other deposit. These changing frameworks made it easier to buy investment properties over time.

This means that phasing out negative gearing today is not the same as it was in 1985.

A paper modelling the tax benefits of the opposition’s proposal was released in February 2016 by Associate Professor at the Australian National University, Ben Phillips. The paper was aimed at understanding the tax revenue that could be made in the long run from reforming negative gearing. It was estimated to be between $3.4-3.9 billion per year.

However, the research note on Professor Phillips’ modelling does not attempt to model behavioural changes of investors. He did not set himself that task.

Behavioural changes in response to changing policy can lead to unintended consequences. Theoretically, tax revenues will go up if you start charging investors more tax, but this assumes your investors won’t divest from property or they will keep buying property at the same rate.

In the lead up to grandfathered reforms, there could be an effort to purchase established properties to negatively gear before July 2017. It could create a kind of ‘happy hour’ in the housing markets.

After July 1 2017, the inability to negatively gear existing stock might mean that a new cost-benefit analysis would go into the purchase of existing stock. Unless an investor can positively gear a property, or they believe the capital gains will offset the costs of an investment property, they will not buy it. This could drive prices down.

If prices are driven down, and I cannot say for sure that they would be, but if they were, this would present opportunities for people who wish to buy a family home. However, it could also threaten the capital gains of those relying on their investment properties for later in life. It also creates risk for those with large mortgages if they are not able to make repayments.

In any case, more modelling needs to be done on the potential behavioural reactions to reforms to negative gearing.

"Market Overview

The latest data reveals that most markets saw modest growth in 2015 – with Sydney and Melbourne recording exceptional levels of growth.

Table 1 presents the figures for all major markets across Australia.

Table 1: Statistics Summary

Sydney yet again outperformed all other major markets in annual growth terms, recording a staggering 18.36% and 13.48% growth in the year to December – in the house and unit markets respectively.

Melbourne houses also recorded strong annual growth, of 13.00%, while Perth houses saw an unexpected 2.30% surge in growth in the month of December.

House markets in Adelaide, Hobart and the ACT showed steady capital growth over the last 12 months.

Sydney Boom Ends - Will Growth Spill-Over?

As 2015 wrapped up, so did the Sydney housing boom. The upswing in the cycle lasted almost two years and, in real dollar terms, the median house increased by approximately $375,000.

Historically, Sydney has been the leader of growth and the Melbourne and Brisbane markets would follow. Given this, the Melbourne house market could peak sometime in the first quarter of 2016 while Brisbane could follow later in the year. However, global economic trends and a national crackdown on speculative buying may hamper growth for these other east coast cities.

Graph 1 shows the monthly capital growth trend of Sydney and Melbourne. The graph depicts Melbourne’s peak growth in houses following Sydney.

Graph 1: Monthly Capital Growth Trends, Sydney and Melbourne

It is difficult to say what exacerbated the last upswing in Sydney and whether similar factors will impact other major dwelling markets.

Many have speculated and reported anecdotes of Chinese foreign investment pushing up real estate values, however there is currently no reliable dataset in existence that documents foreign investment in Australian residential real estate[1], therefore it is not rigorously sound to say that this contributed to the enormous value increases.

In any case, the People's Bank of China has placed restrictions upon its citizens taking capital out of China to encourage investment within its own country (citizens are permitted to take just US$50,000 out of the country each year[2]). This action could limit the growth experienced in other Australian cities.

It is also not necessarily true to say that speculative domestic investment bid up the market. However, there is some evidence suggesting that investors became more active than owner occupiers in the latest housing boom.

The ABS collects data on the amount of money lent for the purposes of owner occupation versus investment. In recorded history, 2014 was the first time investor loans overtook owner occupier loans. Graph 2 presents this dataset over the last 5 years. It is worth noting that the figures in Graph 2 are for Australia wide lending, so the phenomena of investors overtaking owner occupiers may not be specific to the Sydney market.

Graph 2: Finance Commitments, Investors v. Owner Occupiers

The graph suggests that either investors were paying more money for dwellings or investors were buying a higher volume of dwellings at this time.

Theoretically, investors who owned property in Sydney could have continued to bid up prices in the market while interest rates were low. The ability to borrow equity against property facilitates this – the higher property prices go, the more equity investors have to purchase new dwellings.

In July 2015, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) announced regulations[3] that would require lenders to hold more capital against home loans. By the beginning of July 2015, a downswing in the Sydney market had begun. Sydney house values fell 0.14% in the month of December, the first fall in the aggregate market since January 2014.

One of the criticisms of APRA’s decision was that it was not specific to the rapidly growing markets of Sydney and Melbourne.

However, of the 514,066 sales we recorded across Australia for 2015, approximately 20% were in the Sydney metropolitan region and a further 20% were concentrated in the Melbourne metropolitan. If anything, high home loan rates may have caused investors to spread their wealth among more affordable cities across the country.

Property developers Stockland and Mirvac have reported that there are Sydney buyers interested in Brisbane apartments. Private developers have also recorded Sydney buyers making up as much as 40% of investment in new developments[4].

While spill-over of investment from Melbourne and Sydney may result in capital growth for the Brisbane market, it is important to note that short term growth is not necessarily synonymous with a long term investment.

A reported 20,000 mining jobs have been lost across Queensland. Although this has mostly been in regional areas, Brisbane’s state product growth could remain subdued as the result of revenue lost from mining royalties and a higher unemployment burden. Indeed, the latest state accounts data showed that Queensland was the only state to see a decline in gross state product per capita in the year to June 2015, of -0.9%.

I expect those in regional mining areas may start migrating to the south-east cities of Queensland in search of new work. However, as the dominant services and tourism sectors in Brisbane are not as high paid or productive, the ‘new normal’ in the Brisbane economy may be low growth, which would filter into dwelling values over time.

What’s Next for the Resource States?

The house price index (HPI)[5] for Perth and Darwin dwellings are presented in Graph 3.

Graph 3: HPI, Perth and Darwin

The Perth and Darwin property markets experienced patchy growth in 2015, but they appear to have sustained higher levels of growth than the pre-mining boom period of the mid 2000’s overall.

Judging by movements in the HPI, the outlook for Perth and Darwin is quite positive. Perth houses experienced monthly growth of 2.30% in December, however it is important to remember that monthly data is volatile so this result may be seasonal.

The troubling thing about these markets is that, although gross state product figures suggest buoyancy in these states, the state final demand and employment figures show a slightly different story.

At the moment, it seems that Western Australia is being propped up by exports from a sector that is shedding many jobs, which means wealth is not being widely distributed. This may limit dwelling demand and rental yield in the future.

Nationally, the shift from resources and agricultural sectors to the knowledge economy has been sluggish, with the federal government accused of being risk averse and discouraging of an innovative ‘start-up’ culture in Australia.

While employment in Australia seems to be improving, wage growth is still at a record low of 2.3% and consumer confidence fell 3.5% from December (2015) to January. This could indicate that the nature of new work being found is precarious. Research indicates that when employment increases but wage growth remains stagnant, individuals are bargaining for more hours of work over higher wages.

Despite official increases in employment, 2016 is likely to see difficult economic times across Australia. While there may be a continuation of growth cycles in Melbourne and Brisbane, and some short term upswings in Perth over the next quarter, investors and home buyers should keep long term growth fundamentals of a market in mind when looking to buy property.

"Our latest research has revealed the best - and worst - annual growth performers in Canberra.

The following table reveals Canberra's top 10 performing suburbs in 2015:

When looking at growth in Canberra as a whole, houses increased in value by a modest 6%. However, house value increases experienced in inner city suburbs is actually quite astonishing – such as in Crace, which saw growth of above 17%.

Observing historical growth rates for houses in Crace, annual growth in 2015 appears to have peaked back in September, at 19%.

With the government currently constrained by a budget deficit, there is unlikely to be significant employment opportunities in the area. Australia’s economy will perform with subdued growth in 2016, which could significantly affect dwelling demand based on a thriving private sector.

The following table reveals Canberra's worst performing suburbs in 2015:

In low density areas such as Wright and Theodore, people may see higher value in buying a house and land rather than purchasing a unit. In fact, most of the suburbs where unit values have significantly fallen are located south of Canberra’s CBD, including Theodore, Gordon, Jacka and Isabella Plains.

Overall, Darwin house and unit markets did not perform well in 2015. The fall in value of resource commodities exacerbated a cyclical downturn in the Darwin market. Even some of the top 10 performers were lucky to achieve single digit growth.

"As Australians frolicked in the sun over the January period, a lot was happening in Asia and in the Northern Hemisphere. Holiday makers here may not have been aware of what was going on, but most would have noticed the $0.95 - $0.99 per litre petrol price as they returned to work after the school holidays.

Great news, you would think.

A falling oil price used to be regarded as a quasi-tax cut giving the consumer more dollars in their pocket as the cost of filling the family car fell. Not only that, profits increased for many companies as the cost of transporting goods dropped.

But if you have been watching the financial news you would have seen that the latest fall in the oil price has not brought any joy.

Instead, it has had a very negative impact on global share markets. In fact, the start to 2016 for the US equity market was the worst on record. Not a very auspicious start to the year.

In case you missed it, here are some facts about the goings-on in January...

Despite a 20% rebound in the last two weeks of January, the oil price closed the month 13% lower. At its monthly low, oil was off 74% from its mid-2014 high.


Global equity markets were hit heavily between the beginning of January and the 20th of the month. The worst of the major markets to be hit during this time was Russia - with a 17% decline. The Chinese market lost 16%, Japan 14%, Germany 13% and the US 9%. The Australian All Ordinaries lost 8%. There was a recovery into the end of January, but the report card for the month has been woeful.

Once upon a time, a rising oil price was the trigger for a decline in equity markets, not vice versa. So why is it so different this time?

First of all, the fall in the oil price is viewed as a sign of a slowdown in world growth, as demand falls. However there are other considerations…

The energy sector in the US boomed in recent times, as the shale oil revolution gathered pace. That revolution was once seen as a major change to the global energy market, as it had the ability to lower oil prices and soften the world’s reliance on Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). US oil production increased dramatically after 2010.

But then, like with everything, the pendulum finally started to swing. Supply began to outstrip demand. Then the oil price began to collapse.

The once “revolutionary"" industry has fought hard to stand up to the increased production from OPEC, but it is finally feeling the pinch. That will have an impact on growth in the US. To make matters worse, there are billions of dollars worth of loans to the shale oil sector. At the current oil price borrowers may be hard pressed to meet their commitments.

Despite the gloomy outlook, OPEC continues to increase production, exacerbating the situation. Talk about “the games people play”!

"Our latest research has revealed the best - and worst - annual growth performers in Perth.

The following table reveals Perth's top 10 performing suburbs in 2015:

A trend identified amongst Perth’s top performing suburbs is that they are located either close to the Perth CBD, close to the coastline or in some cases close to both.

The outer suburbs of Perth such as Alkimos and Kelmscott have enjoyed strong growth during 2015, yet both suburbs have relatively low median values – which could also account for high growth in percentage terms. Activity in Alkimos could reflect affordability in the suburb, but judging by the development happening in this the area it is becoming a popular place to buy. An IGA supermarket is being set up in Alkimos – and when a major chain store is established in a suburb, it is often an indicator of an up and coming area. 

Related Article: Sydney Property Boom Comes to an End, What it Means for Other Markets

However, Perth growth is not currently sustainable. Generally, most suburbs in Perth should decline due to the fall in value of resource commodities and a continued fall in employment. Therefore, these 10 high growth suburbs could potentially be the last areas to enjoy growth. This could either be cyclical or people buying up dwellings in desirable places as more stock comes onto the market.

The following table reveals Perth's worst performing suburbs in 2015:

There is nothing particularly bad about Perth’s worst growth performers of 2015.

The Perth suburbs that retracted in value during 2015 is a reflection of the greater Perth market as a whole, which saw annual growth of 0.70% in houses and -3.96% in units. As the Perth economy comes out of an enormous boom, these dwellings are seeing a correction in value.

The following table reveals Brisbane's top 10 performing suburbs in 2015:

From the table above, you can see that units in Cornubia underwent enormous growth. This was likely a combination of their high affordability and lucky location in the rapidly growing south-east corridor. 

The majority of Brisbane’s top growth areas were located in the inner city – particularly south of the Brisbane River, in suburbs such as Woolloongabba, Sunnybank, Kangaroo Point, Tarragindi and Bulimba. This is good news for many potential buyers in 2016 as it indicates that the greater Brisbane region has further to go in its growth cycle.

The following table reveals Brisbane's worst performing suburbs in 2015:

The data has revealed that most of the suburbs experiencing negative growth in 2015 were dotted around the greater Brisbane metropolitan area, but were located outside of the city centre.

Looking at historical growth figures for Brisbane’s worst performing area – Beachmere – it appears that the suburb is in a cyclical downswing and could experience an upswing in 2016-17. However, the data shows that growth rates are trending down in the long term. Remember to look for the structural factors that promote growth in the long term – such as population growth, infrastructure and employment opportunities. More remote areas of Brisbane are unlikely to perform as strongly.

"Our latest research has revealed the best - and worst - annual growth performers in Melbourne.

The following table reveals Melbourne's top 10 performing suburbs in 2015:

The extra-ordinary growth in Melbourne affirms the theory that this market follows Sydney, which peaked a few months ago. Therefore, compounded by subdued economic growth, Melbourne’s top growth suburbs may not enjoy similar growth in 2016. 

Related Article: Sydney Property Boom Comes to an End, What it Means for Other Markets

The data shows that the eastern suburbs of Melbourne are leading the growth market. Assuming continued steady economic growth, I would say that the Melbourne market is starting to peak. I predict that the inner city, western and south-eastern suburbs are likely to follow. The mitigating factor will be Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) regulations stunting speculative demand.

The following table reveals Melbourne's worst performing suburbs in 2015:

Similar to other Australian capitals, there has been a large growth discrepancy between houses and units in the aggregate Melbourne market. From the tables above, you can see that houses dominated the top growth suburbs while units dominated the worst performer list.

In the case of Melbourne, the disparity of growth between the house and unit markets is likely due to a large stock of units. While the Melbourne house market is at its peak in the current growth cycle, it is no surprise to see units are coming into downswing quicker. Units in spacious areas like Point Cook and Ravenhall are likely to enjoy shorter growth cycles because they are in fairly low density areas.

"Our latest research has revealed the best - and worst - annual growth performers in Sydney.

The following table reveals Sydney's top 10 performing suburbs in 2015:

Pennant Hills is perhaps the most surprising suburb on the top performing list, and it has now has seen double-digit annual growth for the last three years in a row. The sustained popularity of the area could be due to a revitalised interest in the Hills region as new, young families migrate to Sydney and demand large homes, and new infrastructure is added in nearby suburbs.

It is interesting to note that the top five growth suburbs in Sydney are located in the far west and south-west of the Sydney metropolitan area. Elizabeth Hills, Penrith and Macquarie Fields led the way with staggering median value increases of above 30%. 

Rapid growth in the west and south-west regions of Sydney are historically the last areas to experience growth amid housing booms. Sydney’s growth cycles typically begin with the most prestigious, highly valued areas increasing first – mainly around the eastern suburbs and the inner city – with growth then spilling further and further west and out to lower valued areas. Therefore, 2015’s growth in the west and south-west regions of Sydney has signalled that we are at the end of a housing boom. 

Related Article: Sydney Property Boom Comes to an End, What it Means for Other Markets

The following table reveals Sydney's worst performing suburbs in 2015:

A slowdown in growth in Asquith and Winston Hills units reflects very ambitious, optimistic development in these otherwise spacious, leafy suburbs. A decade from now, when Sydney has a more dense population, high rises may be demanded in these areas. However, the quick growth cycles of these dwellings in 2015 taught us that growth in units in Asquith and Winston Hills was perhaps based more on speculative demand than high rise dwelling demand.

Another thing the worst perform list tells us is that no suburb is safe from property cycles. Property has always performed cyclically, even when there is a general upward trend. Church Point is a good example. This beautiful, exclusive waterside suburb was the only area in Sydney to retract in value during 2015, because every property buyer has a limit in what they are willing to pay.

"Our latest research has revealed the best - and worst - annual growth performers in Adelaide.

The following table reveals Adelaide's top 10 performing suburbs in 2015:

A key insight from the table above is that eight of the top 10 suburbs were in the house market - and they are all located within 10 kilometres of the Adelaide CBD. Houses often garner higher capital growth than units because they have the added value of land and provide owners with more autonomy of their space than can be had with units. The suburbs of Fulham, Henley Beach South and Glenelg also have the added value of being in close proximity to the coastline as well as the CBD. So as long as growth in the South Australian economy is steady, this dual combination of proximities could result in the perfect location to secure growth drivers of employment and lifestyle.

Related Article: Sydney Property Boom Comes to an End, What it Means for Other Markets

The following table reveals Adelaide's worst performing suburbs in 2015:

All 10 of Adelaide’s worst performing suburbs were from the city’s unit market. This is likely due to several different factors, such as: 

Units present an inferior dwelling in a low density city like Adelaide.
Some of these suburbs are not desirable to live in.
Some suburbs are seeing units in a cyclical downswing.

Greenacres, for example, is a suburb north of the Adelaide CBD, giving it good access to employment and entertainment. However, houses in Greenacres have historically lead upswings while units have lead the downswings. This means that units do not enjoy as long of a growth cycle in this suburb because they are an inferior dwelling type. A suburb like Hackham on the other hand is not as desirable to live in because it is further from the city and is not as established.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will hold the official cash rate at 2% in February.

The decision comes amid mixed economic indicators for Australia and the announcement that interest rates in Japan have now moved into negative territory.

Due to the pending enforcement of higher risk weights against property set by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), today’s Board decision is unlikely to directly impact the housing market. However, housing market movements are likely to have an impact on the health of the domestic economy, which may impact future cash rate movements.

The Bank of Japan announced negative interest rates last Friday. This decision reflects a ‘pay to park’ policy and saw rapid depreciation of the Japanese Yen. As a result, depreciation in the Australian dollar is likely to be slowed. Yesterday, the AUD closed at US$0.7082 and has been trending up from its seven-year low of US$0.6827 in mid-January.

Many countries are motivated to use expansionary monetary policy to devalue currencies, making tourism and exports competitive. However, as countries attempt this simultaneously, some will maintain relative strength. While the cash rate has been held, the movement of trade-partner currencies may impact future cash rate decisions by the RBA. Australia’s balance of trade has been negative since March 2014.

A report from the World Bank suggests that currency depreciation is approximately half as effective in boosting export demand as it was in the 1990’s[1]. This is largely due to the increased globalisation of production, and this may limit the impact of a cash rate cut in Australia in stimulating export demand.

Despite a deteriorating balance of trade, some indicators of the Australian economy have improved. The inflation rate increased to 1.7% in the year to December and core inflation is within the RBA target band at 2.15%.

The December unemployment rate was 5.8%, which is unchanged from the previous month. The unemployment rate has trended down from 6.3% in July last year and it likely influenced the hold in the cash rate. However, labour force participation was 65.1% in December, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.

Related Article: Consumer Confidence Falls in January, What this means for the Property Market

Employment strength was accounted for largely in New South Wales, where the number of people employed grew by a whopping 4.6% in the year to December.

The fastest growing sectors in NSW in the 2014-15 financial year were construction (13.29%), accommodation (10.49%) and real estate (9.18%). Growth in construction and real estate accounted for almost 50% of NSW’s growth in Gross State Product.

With housing markets in NSW likely to enter a downswing in 2016, particularly in Sydney, it is possible that the job figures will deteriorate over the year as demand for real estate and subsequently the construction of new dwellings drops off.

Slowed demand in the Sydney market has presented itself in the latest Onthehouse.com.au data, with the median house value falling 0.14% in December. The median sale price for houses also dropped in the month of December, by 1.74%.

Darwin, Melbourne and Brisbane housing markets also saw a slight fall in values in the month of December, however it is important to remember that monthly data can be volatile and these figures may reflect seasonal factors.

Unfortunately, 2016 does not present opportunities to offset job losses in resource markets. With bearish attitudes developing towards housing markets in NSW, buoyancy may also be lost from employment in construction and real estate services.

These domestic factors are compounded by a slowdown in momentum of US growth and uncertainty in the Chinese economy. These circumstances will make it difficult for the RBA to maintain a 2% cash rate in the year ahead.

"Lacking in the packing department? Here’s some handy tricks to help you move from one place to the next with less of the stress.

1. Can a list assist?

Ah, you bet it can! Who to change your address details with is a list on its own. Then there’s getting the internet, power and water sorted, organising help, doing that final clean. No list = big mess.

2. Let’s go shopping.

If you’re the bees’ knees at packing, you’ll have those moving ‘must haves’ like tape, markers, bubble wrap and newspaper. If not, hit the local shops early and kick off the packing process pronto.

3. Get ready to box.

Markers and tape are worth nada without boxes. Figure out how many of each size you’ll need, and unless you want your move to be boot camp, try packing the big boxes with stuffed toys or cushions.

4. A room at a time.

When push comes to shove, it’s easy for one room’s things to end up in the boxes for another. Pack down one room at a time to make unpacking breezier. Try loading up the truck in a similar way, too.

5. Set up a schedule.

Keep meltdowns out of your moving day. Have your game plan locked and loaded the night before. It’ll help you avoid paying your removalists or mates with cash or apologies from waiting around.

"The intervention by APRA has certainly made it more difficult to access finance nowadays, especially if you’re just starting out as an investor.

The banks have collectively imposed tighter lending criteria - with most lenders now requiring a 20% deposit when buying an investment property, while others have increased interest rates on investment loans.

Despite this challenging new world of borrowing, Garry Harvey  - the ""Property Guy"" believes that investors could still continue to access finance if they have a solid lender strategy in place.

This involves knowing which lender to use and when to use them.

“You should know which lender to start with, which lender to go to next and so on. If you get the order wrong, it dramatically impacts your borrowing capacity,” says Harvey. “This is becoming most important now because of the way the lenders assess new and existing loans be it their own loan or other institution. You need to put together a lender strategy.”

What a smart lender strategy looks like...

In order to maximise your borrowing capacity, Harvey suggests considering the following sequence.

1. Start with CBA

“One of my preferred lenders is the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,” says Harvey. “That’s because I believe they have a great suite of products in the market on so many levels. The bank still has quite an appetite for investment loans still lending up to 95% including lenders mortgage insurance (LMI). Their credit policy and the way they assess deals and the applicants are quite investor-friendly compared to other lenders, and their online platform is good and they have flexibility within their products so I will always look to start with them.”

CBA uses 7.25% minimum assessment rate, which seems to be the rate many lenders are now adopting, says Harvey.

2. Once you’ve maxed out, go to NAB

Once you reached a point of running out of borrowing capacity with CBA, Harvey suggests going to NAB for the subsequent loan.

“NAB is a bit more generous with their assessment of the debts that are left with other institutions,” says Harvey. “The debts that are left with CBA won’t be assessed as harshly as the new money being sought from NAB. If we started with NAB, they would assess all the money, old or new borrowing, at a much higher rate. Starting with them would give us less borrowing capacity than going there second.”

3. Go non-bank with First Mac or Home Loans Ltd

Once you’ve exhausted your borrowing limit with the CBA/NAB combination, Harvey suggests going to a non-bank lender like Firstmac or look at some of the products offered by Home Loans Ltd.

“We can even go further with them because they will still consider assessing the loans with other lenders at the actual repayment with no buffer, and only assess the new debt at their sensitised rate which could be as low as 7% depending on which funder they use,” says Harvey. “Starting here is likely to result in an overall lower borrowing limit because any existing loans with some of these funders get assessed at the higher assessment rate and not the actual rate which will mean hitting your borrowing capacity sooner.”

What about the other lenders?

Westpac

Harvey thinks Westpac have become quite conservative in the investment space.

“They’ve removed the negative gearing add back so investors can no longer add potential tax credits which could adversely impact your borrowing capacity. They’ve also increased their buffer significantly so the amount of money you can borrow from them has declined a lot over the past few months,” he says.

ANZ

Somewhere in between conservative and relatively flexible, ANZ assesses all loans at P&I even if you have IO loan says Harvey.

“They’ve set their assessment rate at a minimum of 7.25% regardless of what you’re paying,” says Harvey. “They’ve always been a bit tougher on serviceability, so it can be difficult to get some loans to service especially when you have multiple loans with them.”

It is important to point out that this information is accurate as at the time of writing and in recent months many lenders have been updating and changing their policies in response to APRA’s directive.

Biggest mistakes you could be making now with your mortgage

As finance is becoming harder to get, you need to make sure you avoid the following traps when borrowing in the current market:

Choosing the wrong lender or sticking with the same lender you’ve always had. 

Every lender is different and there are very detailed, nitty gritty policy changes that you just won’t be aware of.

The banks are dramatically different – more so than ever. The lender you trusted for years might have policies and criteria in place that completely undermine your multiple property portfolio plans. Being loyal is no longer relevant. Therefore, it’s important to choose the lender above the best rates as this could mean being able to continue investing or hit a brick wall sooner.


Be cautious about fixing your rate.

Because of the fast moving nature of the lending policy changes, you don’t want to be stuck with your lender long-term by being tied to them with a fixed loan.

If your lender’s criteria are no longer working for you and your investment plans, you want the ability to be able to move to another lender that does. Having a variable rate enables you to do that. Breaking a fixed rate loan would cost you tens of thousands of break cost so you need to be confident that you won’t be exiting your loan before the loan term expires

The bottom line is the investment loan market is still very competitive. It’s always best to do your research or speak with a broker when thinking of applying for a loan.

The Consumer Confidence Index is a number that represents how people feel about their personal finance, the broader economy and whether they feel it is time to save or spend.

The number is determined from a sample survey of approximately 1,200 Australians. A Consumer Confidence Index of 100 suggests that of the people surveyed an equal number of people are pessimistic and optimistic about the economy.

A number above 100 indicates there are more optimists about the economy than pessimists, while a figure below 100 – like we have this month – suggests there are less optimists than pessimists.

What do my ‘Feels’ have to do with the Economy?

People’s feelings about the economy seem like an odd thing to quantify. However, the economy is largely dependent on how people feel.

With the US dollar strengthening against the Australian dollar, a decline in commodities and sluggish growth in China (Australia’s largest trading partner) it is no wonder that the Consumer Sentiment Index is falling.

Uncertainty or confidence in the economy influences whether people save up for a rainy day or if they spend their money. This determines how much businesses produce and how much money is made, at any one time.

Movements in the Consumer Confidence Index can therefore indicate how the economy may perform in the coming months.

What does the Consumer Confidence Index say about the Property Market?

Consumer confidence could reinforce movements in the property market.

I say reinforce rather than determine because property and consumer confidence have a complicated relationship.

Consumer confidence does influence whether people decide to buy property or not.

However, the property market can also influence consumer confidence.

This is because property contributes to something called the wealth effect. When the price of someone’s house or unit goes up, this can make them feel wealthier and more confident about spending. This has become particularly apparent since the 1980s, when financial infrastructure evolved and people could more easily borrow money against the equity in their home.

Some academics argue that movements in the value of one’s home has an even greater effect on consumer confidence than income earned from employment. However, there is no clear consensus on this.

But here is where the relationship gets co-dependent: It is generally understood that Australians have a high elasticity of demand for property based on income.

What this means is, when a person’s wealth goes up – and, as we just established, wealth can go up because of increases in the value of one’s home – their desire to purchase property increases.

This means that increases in property prices can lead to further increases in property prices. You may know people who have decided to buy investment properties in the last few years because the value of their own home has gone up. The ability to borrow against property enables people to buy more property.

This is my theory as to why the housing booms in Melbourne and Sydney were as large and long as they were. It took intervention from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to break this cycle and change the way people feel about the market, which will in turn help prices come down.

The fall in Consumer Confidence this month could reflect slowed growth in the major housing markets across Australia. A summary of market performance for December is presented below.

Now I Don’t Know How to Feel

Stay calm. A smart buyer or seller is conscious of these ebbs and flows in the market. Learning to read and understand indicators such as consumer confidence can help you recognise where the economy and property market is in its cycle.

For example, if the Consumer Confidence Index is low perhaps it is not the best time to sell and you could wait until the Index climbs above 100. A Consumer Confidence Index above 100 indicates people are keen to spend money. This may help you achieve a higher sale price for your property.

It is worth noting that although the aggregate Index went down, part of Westpac’s January release showed the Time to Buy a Dwelling Index increased sharply from December to January. The Index increased 13.9% over the month, though is still 1.4% lower than it was last year. Growth in the Index shows that people are currently more optimistic about purchasing dwelings.

This could be a reflection of seasonality in the market, and buyers finding new hope for purchasing dwellings as market growth rates slow down.

Below is the Consumer Confidence Index plotted against quarterly capital growth in median house and unit values across Australia. The data displayed is for the last 10 years.

The graph shows that growth in consumer confidence and property generally move together. This just goes to show that there are many relationships with housing and different economic indicators.

"Our latest research has revealed the best - and worst - performing suburbs across Australia in 2015.

The following table reveals the top 10 performing suburbs in 2015, on a capital city level:

Looking at this list, it confirms what we understand about aggregate growth rates for capital cities.

With Sydney coming off the back of its 2013 to 2015 housing boom, most of the Sydney suburbs represented in the top 10 are located in the west or south-west regions. These are historically the last areas to experience rapid growth amid housing booms, which is how we know this growth marks the end of the upswing in this market.

Cornubia units are a surprise to see on this list as the Brisbane metropolitan area as a whole only saw annual growth of 5.8% in the unit market. Growth in Cornubia could reflect some new residential development happening in the area. 

The following table reveals the worst performing suburbs in 2015, on a capital city level:

The worst performing suburbs once again reflects what we’ve seen in the greater capital city markets.

Last year saw poor capital growth performance in the resource states (Western Australia and the Northern Territory). A correction in these suburbs of approximately 10% is to be expected after a large economic boom. These suburbs could experience better performance in 2016. 

The property market was very volatile across Australia last year, and each state capital market performed uniquely based upon native cyclical patterns and growth patterns.

"The New Year is here, so what better time to start thinking about what you can do differently – or better – over the next 12 months.

For me, one of the most important things I focus on is bringing balance back into my life. What I mean by this is getting everything aligned and in working order.

For example, in many ways life is like a wheel with spokes on it. If the spokes are equal in length – the wheel will be round and will roll in any direction we send it. However, if the spokes are uneven, the wheel will also be uneven and it simply won’t roll properly. Give it a hard enough push and it might roll for a bit but it won’t get very far and eventually it will fall over.

The Wheel of Life

Using this analogy, consider the outside of the wheel as your life and the spokes are the important things in your life.

If the important things in your life aren’t in balance, then your life may not be in balance and this could stop you from achieving what’s important to you.

Of course everyone’s ‘spokes’ are different but in my experience there are six common spokes that help many people enjoy a happy and fulfilled life:

1. Family – Being close and connected to those you love. This not only includes your immediate family but also your extended family like brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles.

2. Social – Socialising and engaging with friends and family, having some fun, and pursuing and sharing common interests and pursuits.

3. Finance – Money matters, investments and debt management.

4. Philosophy – Your belief system, spirituality and religion.

5. Mental – Improving your knowledge, experience and mental acuity.

6. Health – Your physical wellbeing

Rating Your Wheel

The next step is to rate your spokes from 0 to 10, where 0 is poor, 5 is average and 10 is excellent. Once you’ve done this, it’s time to check out what your wheel looks like.

If your wheel is lopsided in particular areas – you will need to focus your attention and come up with some action plans to get the spoke that are lagging behind to the level you think is right.

Ultimately, you should aim to align all your spokes’ ratings - for instance all 7’s out of 10. Once this has been achieved, your wheel – or more correctly your life – will be in balance.

After this is achieved, the next step will be to enlarge your wheel so that all of the spokes are rated as close to 10 as possible.

Get Your Finances in Balance

While we can’t look at everything today, we can look at ways to help balance and align your Finance spoke. Here are five actions for you should try and do as soon as possible:

1. Assess Your Financial Health

Every year you should assess your net worth and set yourself a target for the next 12 months.

Your net worth is calculated by adding up all of your assets (like property, savings, superannuation, investments and other assets) and deducting all your liabilities (like mortgages and other loans, lease or hire purchase agreements and credit and store card debts).

Your aim should be to increase your net worth each year and this will be helped by things like investing wisely, saving more, borrowing less and of course paying off your debts. You should set yourself a long term plan and measure your progress on an annual basis.

Another import aspect affecting your financial health is your ability to maintain your income stream (for instance considering factors such as job security, level of wages, capacity to increase household income and income from investments) and whether your debt levels are reasonable and affordable. Basically, you need to ensure that you can continue to generate reasonable and sustainable after tax cash flow so you can meet your day to day living expenses and financial commitments.

Related Article: 2015 in Review and the Outlook for the Year Ahead

2. Save for the Unexpected

It’s a good idea to have a certain amount of cash saved in a separate account for a rainy day. In my experience, setting yourself a target that is a multiple of your monthly spend is a good way to protect yourself against the unexpected.

For instance, if your day-to-day living expenses (including housings costs like rent or mortgage payments) are $5,000 per month, and you wanted a six month buffer, your savings goal would be $30,000. If you wanted to save this amount by the end of the year, you would have to set aside $2,500 a month.

3. Set Your Retirement Goals

Depending on your age, retirement could be a long way into the future and may not be something you want to worry about right now. However, no matter how old you are, we’re all going to have to take more responsibility for our financial wellbeing once we stop work.

Therefore now is the time to set your retirement goals, especially the quantum of funds you’ll need to have in order to live a reasonably comfortable life.

So, start by working out how much you’ll need to accumulate and think about things like how well your superfund has performed, its outlook for the future, its mix of investments and whether you’ll need to make extra contributions (either post tax or salary sacrifice) to bolster your super balance. And remember the earlier you start this process, the greater the likelihood of maximising financial returns.

4. Reduce Your Debt

It’s important your debts are maintained at manageable levels and you’re not living beyond your means. Prepare an annual budget to see what your financial outlook looks like for the coming year. If there’s a shortfall, it means you’ll have to cut back on non-essential spending. If there’s a surplus, use it to pay down expensive debt like credit cards and personal loans.

If you’re not already doing it, make a resolution to pay-off your credit card in full and on time each and every month. Use your budget to help find the extra cash you need to do this.

Finally, now is a good time to think about a home loan health check to make sure you’ve got the best product at the lowest rate.

Related Article: Top 10 Cities to Watch in 2016

5. Mitigate Your Financial Risks

It’s important to prepare for the unexpected. You can do this by setting aside some spare cash (as we explored above) but another approach is to ensure you have adequate insurance policies in place.

With this in mind, write down all the risks that you think could have a material impact on you or your family’s financial wellbeing and then consider the adequacy of your current insurance products or whether you might need additional cover.

Examples of insurance policies you should consider and review include:

House and content
Landlord insurance (if you’re a property investor)
Health
Accident, sickness and unemployment
Car
Life

It’s probably not financially feasible to insure every possibility, so you should consider coverage for those risks that are likely to pose the biggest impact and are most likely to occur. And remember, it is your family as well as you that needs protection.

"The nature of retirement is changing and so are the rules.

If you want to reduce your working hours, or even pay less tax without sacrificing your income, a transition to retirement pension could be the answer.

Longer life expectancies mean many Australians are spending more time in retirement than ever before[1] – which is increasing the burden on our social security system and emphasising the importance of accumulating superannuation.

As a consequence, the Government is encouraging us to remain in the workforce beyond the traditional retirement age.

Did you know that you can access your superannuation while you are still working?

By using a transition to retirement pension, you can generally access between 4% and 10% of your super balance so long as you've reached your preservation age (between 55 and 60 depending on the year you were born) and you are still working up to the age of 65.

A better lifestyle on the same income

A transition to retirement strategy allows you to supplement your income by drawing a regular pension payment from your super fund.

There are a few ways you can benefit from this:

You continue to work full-time but reduce your tax by taking a pension and salary sacrificing some of your income into super.
You move from full-time work to part time work and replacing lost salary with income from the transition to retirement pension.
As a business owner/operator, you could use a pension to supplement your income needs in quiet times.

A transition to retirement pension may also help reduce your overall tax bill while boosting your total super balance before you retire.

This is how it works: You contribute part of your salary to super (where it is generally taxed at just 15%[2] rather than at your marginal tax rate). You then move your super money into a tax-free 'transition to retirement' pension and use your pension income to supplement your reduced salary. The tax-effectiveness of the pension will help lower your overall personal tax liability.

Your preservation age

Under current superannuation law you must reach your preservation age before you can access your super. Your preservation age depends on the date you were born.

DATE OF BIRTH	PRESERVATION AGE
 Before July 1960	 55
1 July 1660 - 30 June 1961	56
1 July 1661 - 30 June 1962	57
1 July 1662 - 30 June 1963	58
1 July 1663 - 30 June 1964	59
After 30 June 1964	60

 

The diagram below will give you an idea of how your money moves when using this strategy:

 

Things to consider

Non-commutable income stream

Your transition to retirement pension income stream is non-commutable, apart from any unrestricted non-preserved components within it. Non-commutable means you can't convert the income stream into lump sum cash until you satisfy a full condition of release from super, such as retirement or turning 65 years old.

Your transition to retirement pension will work in a similar way as a standard superannuation pension, subject to the non-commutable requirements and restriction on the amount of pension you can withdraw. You can withdraw between 4% and 10% of the pension account balance each year and have the flexibility to vary the payment at any time during the year, within these set ranges.

You should also keep in mind the possibility of your career not going exactly to plan – a redundancy or a forced or unplanned early retirement once you're over 55 could interrupt this strategy and mean you will have to review your circumstances with your financial adviser.

Another important point to consider is the concessional contributions cap, which is $35,000 for those aged 49 or over.

Self-managed super funds

If you plan to use this strategy through a self-managed super fund, you should ensure that the trust deed is drafted broadly enough to allow you to commence any pension allowed under super law.

Tax treatment

Once you reach 60 years old, your pension payments and any lump sum withdrawals will generally be tax-free. A financial adviser can help you to structure your pension to legally minimise your tax obligations.

Note about salary sacrificing: Although salary sacrificing into superannuation is a great strategy for increasing your retirement savings, not all employers offer this to their employees. Also, under these arrangements your salary decreases, which could have a flow-on effect to other employment benefits you receive. For example - compulsory Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions may be determined using actual (reduced) salary and might not take into account salary sacrifice contributions.

How does the transition to retirement strategy work in practice?

Tom (56) has a salary of $100,000 per annum plus 9.5% superannuation. He wishes to continue to receive his current net income but maximise the effectiveness of his super. He currently has $300,000 in super and decides to commence a transition to retirement pension.

The table below illustrates that – with the transition to retirement strategy – without changing his cash income received Tom has still saved over $3,860 in tax.

If Tom continues to work after age 60, the amount withdrawn from his superannuation is tax-free. As you can see in the table, Tom's tax savings increase by more than $6,750.

Alternatively, Tom could boost his wife’s super. After salary sacrificing and choosing to take an account based pension, Tom can take part of the contributions he has salary sacrificed to his super and split them into his wife’s account each financial year (as his wife hasn't permanently retired). This gives Tom’s wife’s super a boost and means they can both make use of all the tax incentives available.

The transition to retirement strategy in practice

 	Current Position	With TTR age under 60	With TTR age 60+
Salary	$100,000	$85,000	$85,000
9.5% SG Contributions	$9,500	$9,500	$9,500
Salary Sacrifice Contributions	$0	$15,000	$15,000
Transition to Retirement Pension	$0	$12,000	$12,000
Tax Paid + Medicare Levy (less offsets)	$26,946	$23,976	$21,096
Net Cash	$73,054	$73,024	$75,904
Total Tax Savings	$0	$3,860	$6,750

*Salary sacrifice and 9.5% SG contributions are taxed at 15% in super.

"While the economic outlook for 2016 is weak, there are still locations across Australia that provide good investment opportunities.

With the latest Onthehouse.com.au data, I have identified the top 10 areas to watch in the year ahead, based on strong growth performance, cyclical growth expectations, upcoming developments and historical growth patterns.

While Sydney has been the clear growth winner in recent years, it is in a downswing of its current growth cycle so it is not on the Top 10 list. However, Regional NSW is set to be the winner in 2016, with four regional NSW cities topping the list.

Related Article: 2015 in Review and the Outlook for the Year Ahead

Queensland also has a strong presence on the list, with a total of four metro and regional centres making the Top 10.

The following table lists the Top 10 Cities to Watch in 2016. 

*Data is current to the year ending November 2015. Identified areas are broad Local Government Areas or metropolitan cities.

With cities such as Wollongong and Newcastle being considered as re-homing areas for displaced Syrian refugees, Tasmania continuing to pick-up its tourism market and Queensland boasting some large development projects, there are many emerging areas showing positive economic potential.

Here is my quick breakdown of why each identified area made the list...

City of Gosford, NSW

Suburbs within the City of Gosford enjoy a spill-over of wealth from Sydney in the form of residential investment and from tourism to the lakeside city. Despite enormous growth in 2015, regional NSW tends to lag a little behind Sydney. This is supported by historical growth patterns, therefore growth could continue into 2016.

Lake Macquarie Region, NSW

Lake Macquarie is popular with tourists who are seeking a quick getaway from Sydney, as it is only a two-hour drive from the Sydney CBD. The area contains suburbs with very affordable dwellings, some with strong rental yields. For owner occupiers, the area is popular with retirees and has a growing health care sector to support quality of life.

City of Newcastle, NSW

Newcastle has undergone tremendous development in the last few years. This has partially been the result of people and businesses being priced out of Sydney and seeking more affordable rent in a nearby city. As a result, the Central Coast has transformed over the last few years. Newcastle and Wollongong have also been named as areas to relocate Syrian refugees, which would encourage population growth and increase demand in the economy for a range of services; provided refugees are set up with adequate resources.

City of Shellharbour, NSW

The City of Shellharbour is another regional NSW area that is set to benefit from the Sydney wealth spill-over. Shellharbour is also home to the established City of Wollongong, which has excellent educational and medical facilities, as well as a beautiful coastal setting.

City of Whittlesea, VIC

This is more of a cyclical evaluation; where lower value properties are expected to follow the high end. It's also worth noting that as population growth remains high over the next decade (particularly in Melbourne as approximately one-third of migrants settle in Victoria), anywhere within reasonable distance and commute time to the CBD is likely to see long-term growth. Stockland survey data also suggests that Sydney buyers were registering their interest in Melbourne property, suggesting the appeal of Melbourne will continue in 2016 as residual wealth from Sydney is transferred to the relatively affordable Melbourne market.

Brisbane Metropolitan, QLD

Growth in Brisbane is expected to be partially out of cyclical movements. Historically, Brisbane usually peaks in capital growth after the Sydney and Melbourne markets. As Melbourne is likely coming into peak growth now, Brisbane could see higher value increases in 2016. It is worth noting that this could be mitigated by increases in home loan interest rates and slowed economic growth both globally and in Australia, plus slowed rates of migration to Queensland, which fell by approximately 22 per cent in the year to June 2015.

However, an increase in tourism may drive employment; attracting migration and dwelling demand in the future. According to Tourism Research Australia, Brisbane was the third top holiday destination of overseas visitors, followed by the Gold Coast, with the Sunshine Coast also featuring in the top 10. There are currently also large development programs happening around Brisbane, including a casino at the Queens Wharf site. It is worth making the distinction that this may not be a long-term growth driver, but if you are only looking at movements for the next few years then this area has potential.

City of Logan, QLD

The City of Logan is a growth centre, conveniently located between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Enormous development projects have been approved in the region, particularly in Beenleigh, where the town's CBD is set to see new residences, commercial offices, a new theatre, medical centre and café precinct. However, the highest growth potential is likely to be in surrounding suburbs where values remain relatively affordable.

Greater Hobart, TAS

Tasmania has presented some surprising growth results in 2015. The Hobart CBD and surrounding suburbs in particular have drawn many tourists. Hobart is regarded for its historic charm, with many heritage buildings preserved. Tasmania also has highly regarded produce, which, combined with trade subsidies provided by the federal government, will help to boost exports from Tasmania. As tourism and hospitality pick up in Tasmania, popular centres like Hobart could see further capital growth from employment, affordability and dwelling demand in 2016.

Gold Coast, QLD

According to Tourism Research Australia, the Gold Coast was the fourth most visited destination by tourists in the year to September 2015. The Gold Coast has also recently outperformed growth in both Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, suggesting the booming value of this area.

The Gold Coast is also set to host the Commonwealth Games in 2018. Chairman of the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation, Nigel Chamier, has claimed that preparations for the games are under budget and ahead of schedule, enabling new sports facilities to be trialled in 2017. The government expects $2 billion worth of contracts across the Gold Coast and in other parts of the south-east corridor, in preparation and execution of the Games.

Finally, major residential developments are occurring in the Gold Coast CBD, including The Ruby Towers development, which is expected to be complete in six years time. Although the city centre has seen recent escalations in value, a spill-over of growth may also be expected in nearby suburbs such as Oxenford, Helensvale and Robina.

Sunshine Coast, QLD

As developers anticipate strong migration and affordability to drive dwelling demand, there has been increased construction activity on the Sunshine Coast. Part of the more general cyclical trend, which may see the south-east of Queensland see steady growth in the area, the Sunshine Coast also achieved steady capital growth over 2015. New developments in the region include a University Hospital set to open in late 2016.

"Moving into your new home is one of those times in your life when some good, commonsense advice can really come in handy.

Our friends at AGL have sourced some tips from experts...

Before the Move

Organise, organise, organise - and the earlier the better. You'll thank yourself for it later.

Create a list of everyone you'll need to notify of your new address.
Collect reusable boxes and packing materials early - try your local supermarket.
Declutter! Here's the chance to get rid of things you no longer use. Why not give them to charity or hold a garage sale?
Packing

A little clever packing can make your move run smoothly.

Start packing in advance. Consider packing a box a day for the month before.
Label the box with what's inside, where it should go etc. The more information on the outside the easier it will be to unpack.
Use towels or clothes to wrap your more valuable items. That way you won't need so many boxes.
Don't overload. Too much in one box can be hard to carry. Plus you can risk breaking the box.
Tape the bottom of boxes for extra strength.
Moving with Young Kids

Young kids can find moving fun, scary and tiring all at the same time. To make it easier for them (and you) consider the following. Most importantly, ask someone like friends or family to mind them during the actual shifting.

Get the kids involved. The more they can help, the better they'll feel.
Take them to local parks or areas beforehand so they can start to get comfortable with their new surrounding.
Pack a bag for your kids with their favourite toys, snacks and clothing.
Moving with Pets
Remember to register your pets with the local council.
Make sure that your pets' details are up-to-date. Update their microchip details and ensure that the new contact number is on their tag.
Keep your pet's water bowls, favourite treats and toys handy.
Wait until all the unpacking is done before you introduce your pets to their new home.
On Moving Day

Whether or not you're doing the move yourself or using a removalist, here are some clever ideas to make the move day easier.

If using removalists, make sure you're ready when they are. Remember, removalists sometimes charge by the hour.
If you're moving yourself, pack your truck with all the big items in first. Then pack smaller items to fill in the gaps.
Keep necessities like toiletries, wallets, medicines and personal items handy.
Pack a light lunch and a drink. You'd be surprised how a simple snack can help keep energy levels up.
After the Move

That comfy 'ahh, we're finally home' feeling is so good. These tips should help you get that feeling about your new place and your new community.

Find out your new rubbish and recycling days.
Try alternative driving routes to and from your house.
Investigate your local transport options.
Cut keys and give a spare set to someone you trust.
Visit the local restaurants for take-away menus.

"When reading articles or listening to experts talk about residential property, you will come across terms likes “average” or “median” prices. These may seem like interchangeable terms, but they are in fact quite different and it’s important to understand this difference.

So, what is the difference?

The best way to explain the difference between average price and median price it is to look at the example below. The table list 11 property sales, ranked in order from smallest to largest.

PROPERTY	SALES PRICE
 1	 $410,000
 2	$415,000
 3	$425,000
 4	$440,000
 5	$445,000
 6	$450,000
 7	$451,000
 8	$455,000
 9	$460,000
10	$1,000,000
11	$1,200,000
Average Sale Price

The average (or mean) price is calculated by adding up all of the sales and dividing them by the number of sales. In this case, the total of all sales is $6,151,000, which, when divided by 11 sales, results in an average figure of $559,182.

Median Sales Price

On the other hand, the median price is the sales price where half the sales are above and half the sales are below it. Basically, it’s the middle number. So in this case, the median value is property 6 – or $450,000 – because 5 sales are above it and 5 sales are below it.

Why the Median is a Better Yardstick

Median values tend to be a better statistical measure because they represent the figure other numbers congregate around, or in the case of our example, where most of the sales sit. This is why it is predominantly used in the residential property market where a suburb might have hundreds of sales in a year, or even thousands of properties used to calculate a yardstick value for the area.

Importantly, median values are less likely to be skewed by very high or very low sales. For instance, in our example, properties 10 and 11 are very high values in comparison with the other 9 properties – in fact, they are between 2 and 3 times more expensive. Notably, the impact of these two properties was to raise the average to over $559,000, some $109,000 or 24% higher than the median value.

Interestingly, if we took properties 10 and 11 out of the equation, we would end up with an alignment between a median value of $455,000 (now being property 5) and $439,000 being the adjusted average ($3,951,000 divided by 9). This is a good example of how averages can be skewed by unusually high (or low) numbers.

 

Benefits of using Median Values

The big benefit of using median values is that they help give you a better sense of whether a suburb is likely to be affordable and alerts you to potential opportunities or warning signs.

For instance, if a property is priced below the median value for the area, it could mean it’s under-priced or there’s an opportunity to add value. If it’s well above the median, it could mean that the asking price is too high or there is something special about the property (like its size) that justifies the price. In our example, there would have to be something unique or different about property 10 and 11 to explain the materially higher sales prices.

In any event, where a property’s sales price is markedly different to the median value (up or down) it’s a signal that you should question and investigate further the reasons for the difference, which will help you assess whether they are reasonable or not.

Some Words of Caution

As a final thought, there are two key things to watch out for when using median sales values.

They can be affected by an unusually high number of expensive or cheaper properties sold during the period under review. For this reason, it’s a good idea to measure median prices over a period of time (like 3, 6 or 12 months) to get a better sense of trends and direction.
 
When using median sales values, make sure you compare apples with apples. Remember, a street or suburb can be made up of different property types like houses, units, flats and apartments. You should therefore ensure you assess median values on the basis of the specific property type you’re interested in and not on a combined or overall basis.

"The latest Onthehouse.com.au data reveals that Melbourne houses were the standout performer in the November quarter, the Sydney market continues to show signs of slowing, markets in Western Australia continue to struggle and many unit markets across the country have seen a fall in value.

Table 1: November 2015 Summary

In annual growth terms, Sydney houses again led the market with 20.53% growth in the 12 months to November. However, quarterly growth figures indicate that this market is coming into a downswing. Growth in the November quarter was just 2.93% – which is the lowest result since July 2014. While these figures are still strong, they indicate a clear slowing in this market. Sydney units have also slowed dramatically, with growth for the month of November at just 0.55%.

Despite the slowing of growth in Sydney, 2016 is unlikely to see a market crash due to strong population migration in New South Wales and Sydney feeding dwelling demand. Even a market correction of 10% would still leave Sydney home owners well off after the latest housing boom.

Interestingly, the regional markets of Lake Macquarie, Newcastle and Wollongong have seen enormous capital growth, which is most likely a result of spill over as individuals and businesses seek cheaper rent outside of Sydney.

Historically, growth in the different dwelling markets around the country have not been synchronised. In fact, assuming the economy is performing steadily, the Melbourne and Brisbane markets could be yet to experience peak capital growth before slowing in late 2016. However, economic uncertainly and lending restrictions may prematurely curb growth in these markets.

Growth in the Melbourne house market was a strong 6.10% in the November quarter, bringing the median value to $750,000. Annual growth in this market was also strong, up from 11.03% in the year to October to 12.87% in the year to November.

While growth in the Melbourne house market was strong, there is a large growth disparity between houses and units.

Melbourne units performed steadily with annual capital growth of 6.13%, however values dropped 0.37% in the month of November. The 6.74 percentage point difference between annual growth in these two markets is the largest growth disparity on record. This is presumably due to large levels of stock in the unit market relative to demand. Graph 1 presents the growth trend.

Graph 1: Melbourne and Regional Victoria – Capital Growth Trends

Annual sales figures for Melbourne indicate that houses are the more desired dwelling purchase – with Melbourne houses recording the largest volume of sales in the year to November, with 52,530 sales.

Brisbane was expected to be a strong performer in 2015, but even though the market remained in positive growth it was very slow and subdued as a whole. Select markets such as those in close proximity to the CBD and in the south-east performed more strongly.

Continued commodity declines have presented enormous challenges for the mining sector and state government revenues. It is for this reason that care should be taken when considering the economic output of mining projects and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Queensland. In particular, it should not be assumed that these projects will see long term high capital growth in nearby dwelling markets. This is an important takeaway from recent commodity price crashes.

Indian company Adani is set to go ahead with a coal mine and connecting the rail line in Central Queensland’s Galilee Basin. The Queensland Land Court ruled Adani should receive mining leases, however the court agreed that the benefits of the $16 billion project are overstated.

Adani claimed the project would create 10,000 jobs annually from 2024. This has since been revised down to 1,464 full time equivalent jobs. Furthermore, the $22 billion in mining royalties anticipated from the coal mine was based on inflated estimates of the commodity, meaning this figure will be lower.

Challenges also exist for prospects around LNG projects in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

By the time these projects go into operation, the LNG market is forecast to be in a supply glut of approximately 20-30 million tonnes through to 2018, according to Bernstein Research. Oversupply in LNG is partially due to the increase in participating suppliers but also slowed economic growth, especially from China. However, the LNG projects across Australia largely have supply contracts already secured with set prices.

Economic Outlook

The Federal Government delivered the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) in recent weeks, which updates the economic and fiscal outlook from the previous budget. It also takes into account all of the decisions made since the release of the budget, which affect expenses and revenue and hence revises the budget aggregates.

As a result, the government has increased the budget deficit to $37.4 billion over 2015-16, which is greater than the May budget outlook by $2.3 billion.

Despite the budget deficit, Australia still maintains a sustainable level of debt to GDP[1]. So long as debt is at a sustainable level, it is not thought to have a large effect on economic growth relative to other factors such as investment in education.

Employment in Australia seems to be moving in a positive direction, which has surprised many people.

Capital investment and commodities have not performed well this year, leading to a huge reduction in revenue for businesses and government alike, and thousands of people losing work. However, employment and participation in job searching has improved over 2015, which can be seen in Graph 2.

Graph 2: Unemployment and Participation

The dark blue line indicates where trends in employment began to move favourably. In a recent interview with the Australian Financial Review (AFR), Governor Glenn Stevens suggested this may be because the sectors behind employment growth may not require large amounts of capital investment, such as services, tourism and hospitality.

Uber is one such example of an emerging service where little large scale capital investment is needed, especially from drivers. Uber reportedly employs 15,000 people in Australia.

As a result, Stevens has revised down expected jobless figures and the need to further reduce the cash rate.

However, I would argue that the nature of employment is not enough to provide a wealth effect that would fuel demand strong enough for housing. Wage growth remained at 2.3% in the September quarter and it is likely that a significant portion of new found employment would be part time work.

As documented thoroughly this year, unaffordability persists across the country in both ownership and rent of dwellings. Unaffordability, combined with higher interest rates and low wage growth means that we probably can’t expect the exceptional growth seen this year in any of the major capital city markets in 2016.

Australia’s economy still faces many challenges before returning to strong GDP growth, and many dwelling markets across the country are also likely to see slowed or negative growth in 2016. However, property is a long term game and we have very diverse markets and opportunities throughout the country. I will aim to highlight more of these unique opportunities in 2016.

Unit then, I wish everyone happy holidays and a happy new year.

"I’ve recently gone through the joys and travails of a kitchen makeover – and it was no ordinary renovation. I gutted our old kitchen and went for something completely new – a different design and layout.

The experience had its ups and downs, which got me thinking that it might be something worth sharing – to give those who want to update their kitchen (or go through any other major renovation) a starting point.

Here are my top 10 takeaways from my renovation experience.

1. Know when it’s time to update

If you’ve been living in the same home for some time now, there comes a point when a simple coat of paint won’t cut it anymore. It’s not enough to reflect what you need, not to mention that the appliances get old and wear out – and eventually need replacing and modernising.

It was after 15 years of use that I realised it was time to bring out the sledge hammer and redesign my beloved kitchen. The kitchen is the heart of my home and there has been some great family memories made in there – but it was at the point where it was beyond reasonable repair. It was time to bring it into the 21st century.

2. Get your property valued before you begin

I realised from the outset that this wasn’t going to be cheap exercise, so I wanted to make sure it was going to be a worthwhile investment in terms of time and money. Even though I believed updating my kitchen was a sensible move and would add value, I still arranged for a couple of local selling agents to provide me with an indicative valuation before we commenced.

There are some real benefits of doing this before committing to a renovation, both emotionally and financially. A major benefit is that a good selling agent will give you an independent and unbiased opinion from a sales/price estimate perspective, including matters such as whether your kitchen really does need updating, what impact the renovation will have on enhancing demand and whether you’re likely to get back the cost of your renovation (or more) through a higher sales price. I had the added bonus of one selling agent politely asking me whether an update of my bathrooms was on the list, which they are –because like the kitchen, they’re over 15 years old.

3. What you can afford and what should you spend

This is a very important step.

Firstly, you have to work out what you can reasonably afford and how you might fund your renovation. This comes down to budgeting, getting your finances in order (do you need to draw down on your home loan to pay for the renovation) and working out how soon you can afford to start.

Secondly, you need to understand how much you should invest to avoid spending too much and over-capitalising. This is where getting some advice and insights from local selling agents can pay real dividends. In my case, I discussed some ballpark figures with the agents I approached to make sure my planned spending was appropriate for the property and the area. Interestingly, not only should you be weary of spending too much, but should also be mindful of spending too little – a lack of appropriate investment can undermine adding value.

Some key cost elements to consider when budgeting for a kitchen renovation:

Design costs (this is normally free but check just in case)
Cabinetry, draw sliders and handles
Splash backs
Benchtops
Tapware
Trade works – electrics, plumbing, plastering and demolition of old kitchen
Project management
Lighting e.g. internal/under cabinetry lighting
Major appliances – this can be a big cost. Like the kitchen itself, the appliances need to be appropriate for the property and the area. If you’re replacing everything, you could be spending considerable amounts on things like a new fridge, oven, cook tops, dishwasher, exhaust fan, power points and light switches.
4. Who to go to for quotes

Once you have a rough idea of what you can afford to spend and the kitchen design you like, it’s time to get some quotes.

Start by approaching family and friends who may be able to recommend someone they’ve dealt with in the past, or know someone who’s had a good experience renovating a kitchen. A personal recommendation from someone you know and trust is by far the strongest form of endorsement. The kitchen supplier I ended up with came via a recommendation from a tradesperson we use regularly.

Before that, I reached out to a number of specialist kitchen installers, cabinet makers and DIY kitchen suppliers. I eliminated DIY suppliers (because I needed a custom kitchen and didn’t want the hassle of installing and project managing the kitchen myself) and cabinet makers (largely due to their lack of interest and their price) and came to the conclusion that a specialist kitchen designer and installer was probably the best approach for my renovation.

In the meantime, I arranged four quotes and visited a couple of DIY stores to get a sense of alternatives and design options. It took around two months from when I started looking at kitchens to finally get a quote from a supplier I was happy with. The important lesson here is to take your time and don’t rush. It’s okay to say no if you don’t like what you see. Remember, in an ideal world a new kitchen should last around 10 years, so it’s important to get it right from the start.

5. Be flexible and prepare to compromise

You probably have a reasonably clear idea on what you want in terms of layout and design, but whether this is achievable will depend on your budget and the space and footprint of your existing kitchen. Therefore, I think it’s important to separate things that are “must haves” (the things you can’t live without) and the things that are “nice-to-haves” (the little extras you want but can do without).

For instance, you may have to compromise on things like bench space or the number of cupboards if space is tight or you’re renovating on a limited budget. This may also extend to kitchen appliance brands, which ideally should match the overall quality and design of the base kitchen, including benchtops. Good kitchen designers should be able to give you guidance and advice on what you can and can’t do based on your budget.

6. Hidden costs

I have some bad news – kitchen renovation costs generally don’t end with the kitchen itself. This is especially the case for properties where the kitchen is part of an open plan family and/or dining room.

The colour of kitchen doors, benchtops, splashbacks and appliances affect the colours of surrounding walls and ceilings – they can clash or they can enhance or match. More likely than not, you’re probably going to need a new paint job – especially if your colour scheme is as old as your kitchen. And, if you are doing a major redesign, then there will likely be some wall damage requiring plaster work and a repaint.

After realising I’d need a new paint job, I brought in a colour consultant and got a great return for my small investment. Not only did the colour consultant give excellent advice on the kitchen/family room colours, but they also gave me some great ideas for the colour of the glass splashbacks and a feature wall.

It’s important to remember that the aesthetic appeal of a new kitchen can be greatly reduced if you get the room colours wrong. On top of this, if you’ve moved benches around you’re likely to have floor damage – meaning it will require repair or replacement. In my case, my wooden floors needed to be sanded and resealed – adding more cost, inconvenience and mess to the renovation.

Another cost not covered by the kitchen quote was the installation of new ceiling lights, a telephone socket, light switches and water temperature controller. I also decided to spend a bit on new light switches and power points – so there was the additional installation costs of these as well as the cost of the units themselves.

All of the ‘little’ extra expenses add up – so it’s important to factor these into your budget and discussing them when getting your kitchen quotes. In particular, you need to clearly understand what is and isn’t included in the initial quote.

7. Delays are inevitable

A lot goes on when installing a custom kitchen, which usually happens over many weeks:

- the new kitchen has to be designed and built in a factory
- the old kitchen has to come out
- the new kitchen has to be delivered and fitted
- trades people have to do their bit – electrical, plumbing and plastering
- the splashback has to be cut, coloured and fitted
- the new appliances, power points and light switches have to be installed and fitted
- the corking (e.g. sealing with silicon) has to be done

It is inevitable that delays will occur, either due to things like manufacturing delays, the availability of tradies, a holdup in the delivery of any appliances you may have ordered, or simply because of bad weather. Whatever the reason is, delays can add days and weeks to your planned completion date and it is often outside the control of the kitchen company.

The key is to expect and accept that delays will occur, which requires some patience, understanding and foresight. For instance, you should provide a reasonable buffer between your planned completion date and the actual final date, taking guidance from how things are going during the course of the renovation.

8. Expect some inconvenience

It goes without saying that when your kitchen is out of action there’s going to be some inconvenience. In my case, my family and I did a lot of our cooking and dishwashing in the laundry for around three weeks – and I have to say we were over it after the first week. In the scheme of things though, this was a small discomfort because once the new kitchen was in we were very pleased with the results.

If you’re renovating your kitchen and you have small children you need to be especially careful. It’s messy and there’s usually a lot of junk lying around, including sharp objects like nails, screws, wires, metal and tools, not to mention it’s going to be dusty, dirty and noisy. Ideally, the kitchen should be inaccessible to little kids. If this isn’t possible, it might be worth having them stay with friends or family until the worst is over.

The kitchen installer should be able to let you know how long the installation will take and how long it will be until it is fully operational. You can use this advice to decide your best course of action –which could include eating out or enjoying the odd take-away or two.

9. Do a thorough final inspection

During the course of the renovation I would recommend keeping a list of any problems or defects you may identify, and arrange a time to discuss these with the project manager on an ongoing basis. It’s better to sort things out as early as possible, particularly when the appropriate tradesperson may still be around.

As the renovation nears completion, you would have probably made a number of progress payments but allowance is usually made for around 5% of the total price to be held back until you give the final sign-off that everything is OK. When all the work has been done, you need to do a thorough and final check.

During my final check, I made sure everything worked as it should, there was no paint chips or scathes, cupboards and doors were properly aligned, all power points and light switches worked and the overall finish and design was as promised. I did pick up on a few things but they were sorted out quickly and I was very happy with the final product.

As an aside, you should check what guarantees come with the kitchen before you sign on the dotted line. Any appliances you buy will have they own individual guarantees, but the kitchen itself should have a warranty period of at least 10 years.

10. Post renovation review

When the new kitchen is in and things like painting, floor repairs and any other ancillary work is complete, it’s time to get the selling agents back to get their new assessment of your property. Again, you should seek an objective and unbiased opinion, remembering they will base their comments on what the market is telling them and not your personal tastes. This is the point where you can test whether your renovation has been a successful one, at least from a financial perspective.

For me, the news was good! My family and I are enjoying our new kitchen knowing that it meets our personal and lifestyle needs, as well as adding value to our property. Importantly, I estimate that it will likely last for the next 10 years or so, after which it will probably be time to move on to a new home and allow someone else to come in and undertake the next renovation project.

"Holiday rentals can be a risky investment – high rental yields can be seasonal and mask the limited growth potential an area has.

Take Port Douglas as an example.

Port Douglas is one of Australia’s most popular holiday spots, and in October this year alone units in this market were fetching a median rent yield of 8%. However, capital growth in the last 10 years has been virtually non-existent. Monthly annualised capital growth in the Port Douglas unit market between 2005 and 2015 averaged -1.92%.

Rental yields in holiday destinations can also be absorbed by maintenance fees, such as pool upkeep and cleaning. So, rather than risk the costs of seasonal holiday rental locations, why not find affordable locations that are great for holiday makers and are also likely to rent out all year round.

With this in mind, and in the spirit of giving this holiday season, we have pinpointed 10 hidden gems that could make ideal investment locations – where dwellings are affordable, capital growth potential is good and good rental yields are available for holiday makers and locals alike.

This is where the benefit of using a Mortgage Broker comes in. Brokers know which lenders will lend what and to whom. And, in a rapidly-changing world, really good Brokers stay in close touch with banks and lenders so they are ready for any policy changes. This way, clients don’t have the rug pulled from under them.

This is particularly the case for reputable non-bank lenders who can match the ‘big four’ rates and products, but are not faced with the same government restrictions.



When you are choosing a Mortgage Broker, you may want to ask these key questions:

How often do you attend Professional Development sessions?
How many lenders do you have on your panel?
Which non-bank lenders are on your panel?
Are you part of a wider group where fellow brokers share industry tips and updates?
How long have your group members been in the mortgage broking profession?

"Unfortunately, not all properties sell the first time they’re listed for sale, even in a hot market. Those that do sell can go pretty quickly, while those that don’t can languish on the “for sale” register of selling agents for some time.

Around 20% to 30% of properties fail to find a buyer. Whatever the reasons for this are, sellers have to prepare themselves for the possibility that their sales campaign may be unsuccessful. Just in case this happens to you, here are my 10 tips to help you plan your next steps…

1. Review Your Price Strategy

This should be one of the first things you consider. You need to make sure your for sale price is a true reflection of your property’s value and prevailing market sentiment.

There’s no point sticking to an unrealistic value that’s way out of kilter with the market – this in itself could be the reason your property hasn’t sold. Sure, you want to get the highest price possible for your home, but price is something the market will determine. And remember, the longer your property is on the market the harder it becomes to get any benefits from re-advertising at a lower price as buyers may have moved on and market conditions may have turned against you.

The key point here is to do your research. Visit Onthehouse.com.au and check out comparable properties and the prices they sold for, and get a free property profile report on your property to get an indication of what your property might be worth.

Price is a sensitive issue and you need to be mindful of the psychology of selling. For instance, you are likely to get more interest if your property is priced at $499,000 rather than $501,000. Also don’t forget to take into account seasonal factors and where we are at in the property price cycle when setting your price expec

2. Assess Your Selling Agent

Your selling agent is working for you so you should ensure you’re getting the level of service you expect and are paying for. There is absolutely nothing wrong with letting your agent know if you’re not happy or you are concerned about progress – sooner rather than later.

For instance, don’t leave it until after the auction to let them know you have been having concerns because by then it is be too late.

The key, of course, is to do your homework on the selling agent before you appoint them. Check them out online, get references and trust your gut. If things don’t work out, find someone else if you plan to keep your property on the market after an unsuccessful auction or a prolonged private sales campaign.

3. Revisit Your Advertising Campaign

Your selling agent should be able to tell you how many online views of your property took place and how many inspections occurred. Ideally, this should be compared to expected numbers in each category to help measure the effectiveness of the campaign – and it will also help you identify any gaps in your campaign.

Pictures are a powerful online selling tool, so you should also review whether the ones chosen for your property show it in its best light and highlight its best features. In particular, your pictures should promote the aspects of your property that will be attractive to your target market.

Additionally, take a look at the property description to make sure the words used are enticing and creative, as well as accurate and truthful. The effective combination of pictures, content and online position and exposure in relevant local newspapers and publications should combine to form a powerful marketing platform. If it hasn’t, your selling agent has some explaining to do.

4. Give Your Property a Face-Lift

Ideally, you would have addressed key make-over issues and opportunities before putting your property on the market, but during the course of the campaign a good selling agent will encourage feedback from potential buyers. This feedback can point to issues that have not been previously considered and those that could be barriers or turn-offs to a successful sale.

Good curb appeal is very important to buyers, as is having a property that is neat, tidy and doesn’t require too much maintenance or repair work. Remember, you don’t want any issues or problems evident in your photos – these should show the property in in best light and, hopefully, in pristine condition.

You might also consider staging future open for inspections. That is, bringing in some hire furniture to help show your property off. It might cost a bit extra, but it may pay for itself many times over if it helps secure the sale.

A big plus in giving your property a cost effective make-over is that it not only helps meet the market in terms of expectations but may also encourage previous viewers to come back for a second look – this could lead to a sale without the need for a full-blown marketing campaign.

5. Withdraw the Property

This is not an especially palatable option but in some cases it may be necessary, especially if your property has been on the market for some time. The problem with properties that have been on market for a while is that buyers tend to avoid them, or, if they show interest, try to negotiate down the price in the hope you may be desperate to sell.

The magic number seems to be around 90 days on the market. If your property hasn’t sold by then you probably won’t get the price you want from the current cohort of buyers. You might be better off taking your property off the market for a few months and waiting for new buyers to make an appearance. In the meantime, you can sort out any issues or problems and start your new campaign afresh.

6. Postpone the Sale

You could have your timing wrong and now is not the right time to sell. To help you determine whether this might be the case, there are two key factors to consider – seasonal and where we’re at in the property cycle.

Seasonal factors – the most popular time to sell is during spring and summer because, among other things, gardens tend to be in bloom, the weather shows off the property in the best light and there are more family viewings – especially during the school holidays. On the other hand, autumn and winter can be good times to sell because there are fewer properties on the market and therefore less competition.

Property cycle factors – property values move in cycles –upturn/boom, downturn/stagnation (or deflation if the market goes really pear-shaped). The trick is to sell while prices are increasing and before the market peaks because during this period potential buyers will see upside potential in property values.

It might be that you are selling in summer, whereas an autumn sale might be the better option. Or the market has bottomed and is approaching a period of growth. Whatever the reason, it’s important to get your timing right and this is where seeking the advice of a local selling agent can be helpful. You may be able to sell your property at the price you want simply be waiting a bit until market conditions are in your favour.

7. Listen to the Market

There is a big difference between listening and hearing. Hearing is about taking in what is being said but not doing anything about it, whereas listening is acknowledging what you’re being told and responding appropriately.

Hopefully you’ve asked for advice from friends, family and your selling agent about why your property has not sold, but unless you do something about it nothing is going to change. Change can be difficult to implement if there is a strong emotional connection to the property – because it can be hard to erase your family’s history (e.g. repainting your kids bedroom) and hard to say goodbye.

It’s important to be objective and have your eye clearly on the end game – a successful sale. So take a deep breath and take on board what the market is telling you.

This is not exactly a solution to the selling problem but it may help deal with some of the reasons for selling – such as situations where you may need to vacate your property for the short or medium term. Examples could include when you’re relocating for a job, family matters or because you’ve outgrown your home.

The idea behind renting is that you’ll generate sufficient income to help meet mortgage repayments and help ease the financial burden if you plan to rent or buy somewhere else. Of course you’ll have to do your sums to make sure it stacks up financially, not to mention being prepared to take on the responsibilities and obligations of being a landlord, but it might help get you over the immediate hurdle of not being able to sell your property.

9. Refinance

If you are selling because of financial reasons, then refinancing and perhaps some form of debt consolidation may be a viable option. Again, you’ll have to do your sums and make sure you would be financially better off in doing this, but getting a cheaper and more flexible home loan could make a big difference to your family finances. It may also help buy some time so you can put your property back on the market down the track. Just remember to seek independent advice and work collaboratively with your financial adviser and selling agent.

10. Stay Positive

It goes without saying that an unsuccessful sales campaign can be emotionally draining and financially disappointing (since you have forked out for legal and advertising costs and possibly the cost of an auctioneer).

Therefore, it’s very important to stay focused and positive, and not allow any disappointments to cloud your judgement or objective decision making. Don’t rush into further action – take your time and reflect. You need to give yourself every opportunity to sell your property at the price you want and this may take a little more time and need a new strategy. Staying positive is an important part of that strategy.

"The 2013 housing boom has prompted serious discussion about housing affordability. It has challenged the ‘Australian Dream’ of home ownership, with many non-home owners choosing to (or being forced to) rent rather than commit to a mortgage.

Two problems exist with renting as opposed to home ownership in Australia:

Wealth disparity
Renting is precarious
Wealth Disparity

There is an enormous wealth disparity between home owners and non-home owners.

In the two years to October 2015, the median Sydney house increased in value by 41.04% - or $310,000. During the same period, average weekly earnings in New South Wales only went up by 3.76%.

In other words – if you’ve owned a median house in Sydney since October 2013 your wealth has increased by over 41.04%. If you didn’t own a median Sydney house – your wealth only went up by an average of 3.76%.

Renting is Precarious

The second issue with renting in Australia is that it is precarious.

Leases in Australia typically last 6 to 12 months, leaving living situations in a state of flux.

Good tenant and landlord relationships do exist and can, in some cases, last years. However, with interest rates and house values rising – and with mortgages to repay, both home owners and tenants are sacrificing more of their income to have a roof over their heads.

Rent on the median Sydney house went up by 12.67% ($75 per week) in the two years to October. This is a significant increase compared to the rest of Australia – where the increase was only 4.88% (approximately $20 per week).

National Shelter, in partnership with Community Sector Banking and SGS Economics and Planning, recently released a report with a Rental Affordability Index.

National Shelter argued that the unaffordability of rent is likely to force low income households to move out of certain urban areas.

One of the indicators used in the research was the percentage of household income it takes to make rental repayments. It is widely established that spending anything above 30% of gross household income on rent is unaffordable.

Using gross median household income[1] and Onthehouse.com.au median rent data for individual metropolitan postcodes across Australia[2], I have determined the percentage of income required to meet rent payments in different postcodes.

Of all metropolitan postcode areas measured, 64.25% (541) showed households were paying an unaffordable level of rent – that is, 30% or more of household income.

Unsurprisingly, the research revealed that the majority of unaffordable postcodes are found in Sydney (38.08%) and Melbourne (23.10%).

Figure 1: Rental Affordability - Sydney

Many postcodes around the Sydney CBD require 40% to 70% of median household income to meet rent repayments.

In fact, of the 230 postcode regions analysed across the entire Sydney region, 206 areas required rental repayments of more than 30% of the postcode’s median household income.

Rozelle was the only inner city postcode area in Sydney showing rental affordability of under 30%, but this is a function of high incomes in the area.

Despite relatively low dwelling values, the south-west regions of Sydney are also unaffordable due to low incomes.

Another thing to note is that these percentages are of median rent to median household income. It is safe to assume that low income households would struggle to keep up with Sydney rents.

Sydney also dominated the list of the most unaffordable postcode areas to rent in across the country. This list is presented in Table 1.

Table 1: Most Unaffordable Rent Postcodes - Sydney 

Melbourne also presents large levels of rent unaffordability.

Figure 2: Rental Affordability - Melbourne

The data shows that the most affordable area close to the CBD is the south-western region of Yarraville (10 km from the CBD) where gross median weekly household income is estimated to be $1,770, with the median rent being around $510 per week. This means households are spending approximately 28.8% of gross income on rent.  

Outrageously, rental affordability was the best in Canberra due to a combination of high incomes and low house values.

Figure 3 shows the percentage of household income spent on rent in Canberra postcodes.

Figure 3: Rental Affordability - Canberra

With those in Capital Hill typically paying a low 24.3% of income on rent each week, it is no wonder the Federal Government is inactive on housing affordability.

"When taking a holistic approach to what makes house values rise, retirement costs are an obvious contributor.

I have argued that because of favourable tax treatment and finance structures, housing presents an appealing investment for individuals who are facing health and aged care costs.

This could be part of why investment in housing has increased so rapidly over the last two years, even overtaking owner occupiers in terms of the amount of money borrowed from lending institutions for housing purchases in 2014[1].

However, new evidence suggests that when it comes time to finally enjoy the wealth stored in housing assets, retirees are reluctant to do so.

A report released today by the Productivity Commission showed that, despite being asset-rich, many Australians over 60 are unwilling to sell their homes to help fund retirement.

The report, titled ‘Housing Decisions of Older Australians’ notes that residents aged 65 and over have a combine $926 billion in home equity, compared with just $339 billion in superannuation.

It also highlights that in 2011-12, households aged 65-74 years old had an average of $480,000 equity in their homes.

Onthehouse.com.au data shows that the median house in Australian has gained a further $87,000[2] between 2013 and 2015.

As people get older and can no longer work, the family home represents a larger share of an individual’s wealth.

It seems obvious that the family home could be sold and a cheaper perhaps smaller and low maintenance property could be purchased – with the gains made used to fund retirement.

Melbourne and Sydney dwellers would be in a particularly good position – the median house in these cities have increased by $126,000 and $309,000 respectively in the last two years.

So, why do retirees need convincing to sell the family home for retirement?

While there could be an array of reasons, there are three solutions that stand out that could save the country billions of dollars and assist younger generations in getting a foot onto the property ladder.

1. The Means Tested Pension

An owner-occupied home (the family home) has favourable tax treatments for accumulating wealth. Retirees receive a ‘means tested pension’, which means the government may provide poorer households with more pension welfare.

The means tested pension does not take the value of the family home into account. If you live in the property you own, the value of that home is exempt from means testing of the aged pension.

However, selling the family home to downsize means that the gains from the sale of the property could reduce the pension received. This rule, coupled with other psychological factors, suggests retirees might hold onto the family home to maintain a higher pension.

In February this year, Residex founder John Edwards wrote about these concerns, making the argument that the value of the family home over $400,000 should be included in means testing for the pension. He argued this would more quickly incentivise the sale of the family home.

2. Confusing Tax Structures

The report outlines that the sale of the family home is exempt from capital gains tax. This means retirees who have made money on their property over the years would not have to pay tax on those gains.

A significant cost in the later stages of retirement is the refundable residential aged care deposit, which according to the Productivity Commission report is $330,000. However, retirees who are lucky enough to own in the Sydney market would have made close to this in their homes over the last two years alone.

Related Article: Melbourne Outperforms Sydney in October

While the exemption of the family home from capital gains tax could incentivise the sale of the family home for retirement, other taxes take away from reaping wealth. The report references studies which demonstrate that stamp duty, or the tax paid on the transfer of property, can result in disincentive to downsize. This is because it raises the cost of mobility and eats into the equity gained in the family home.

It is worth noting, however, that stamp duty reportedly deterred only a small portion of those surveyed by the Productivity Commission.

3. Cognitive Constraints

Individuals develop fond attachment to the family home, as well as perceive it as a place of secure residence.

As unit values rise along with houses, retirees may be reluctant to downsize because it could create outstanding debt for them.

Retirees have expressed caution around letting go of what is typically their largest value asset, because of uncertainty about the future.

Interestingly, 44% of retirees in survey responses expressed the importance of holding onto the family home as something to pass onto their children.

The report argues that while less retirees hold this attitude now compared with previous decades, the dollar value of bequests from housing is increasing.

Ultimately, the majority of retirees do see their current housing assets as keeping them through retirement, to the end of life. However, because of uncertainty around aged care, health care and longevity, people aged over 65 are taking higher precautions around their savings and holding onto the family home for longer.

The report concludes that more information about such services can help change savings patterns among retirees.

Given the incentives created by uncertainty in health and the tax and superannuation systems, you can’t really blame retirees for believing they should hold onto the family home for longer. It is clear that these systems need reviewing in order to ensure the security and wellbeing of retirees, as well as releasing larger family homes for young families in Australia.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will hold the official cash rate at 2% at its December Board meeting.

The decision is unsurprising. RBA governor Glenn Stevens told a dinner of business economists to “chill out” when asked about a rate cut and the potential for another “surprise” February rate cut.

""February is three months away, we've got Christmas, we should just chill out ... come back ... and see what the data says,"" Mr Stevens said.

Australia’s economy continues to be affected by falling commodity prices. Iron ore fell to a 10 year low late last month - to approximately AUD $63 a tonne, while gold fell to a six year low of AUD $1,468 per ounce in the last weekend of November.

Divestment from mining and slowed demand from China has created bearish sentiment in the Australian economy, with total new capital expenditure falling 6.5% between the June and September quarters of this year – bringing annual growth in new capital expenditure to -17.8% in September.

Despite these marked downturns, a ‘wait and see’ decision was made on the cash rate. This is because today’s Board meeting falls just before the release of pertinent data to Australian monetary policy decisions.

The September quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate will be released tomorrow. Quarterly GDP growth is expected to show expansion of 0.7%, lifting annual GDP growth to 2.3% in September. Annual GDP growth is currently a low 2%.

Unemployment figures improved in October, with the unemployment rate down to 5.9% from 6.2% in September. The participation rate rose marginally to 65% in October.

The labour market figures for November will be crucial for determining whether unemployment is beginning to trend down or if October was just a unique month.

The unemployment rate has trended upwards for the last two years. If this trend continues in November, a further rate cut could be warranted early next year.

The December quarter inflation figures will be released on 27 January, 2016. Annual inflation to September remained low at 1.5%, likely as a result of low wages. Wage growth remained at 2.3% in the September quarter.

If inflation remains below the 2 to 3% mark in the December quarter, the RBA will have flexibility to cut the cash rate in February. This is because lowering the cash rate is partially achieved by the Reserve Bank putting more cash into the market. This has an inflationary effect on prices as currency is devalued, making goods more expensive.

Increases in home loan interest rates have made the recent cash rate decisions have a negligible effect on the housing market.

Conversely, slowed growth rates in housing could have dampening effects on the economy. In turn, this may influence future cash rate decisions.

Capital growth in the median Sydney house fell to 4.04% in the October quarter, down from 7.58% in the July quarter.

Melbourne houses are approaching peak growth for the current cycle, reaching 6.84% in the October quarter.

While Melbourne and Brisbane may still come into higher capital growth rates, dwelling approvals have fallen 1.8% across the country, signalling a fall in building activity for the year ahead.

As real estate and building services decline with capital growth rates, jobs growth and wages may be affected. This could put further pressure on the Reserve Bank to loosen monetary policy next year.

"I was catching up with my friend – let’s call her Jenny – for coffee the other day when we got chatting about her plans for the future. Jenny is 65 years old and was telling me that she wants to move from her current apartment and buy elsewhere, but she is concerned that property prices are too high at the moment so she is going to wait.

If you have read any of my previous articles, you will be aware of some of the arguments I have put forward regarding taking advantage of the cycles in the property market. For example, in a high or rising property market, baby boomers wishing to downsize will be better off selling in a robust market.

But what about someone who wants to sell one property and buy another for a similar amount?

This situation is probably a typical example of the oft quoted theory – ‘If you are buying and selling in the same market it doesn’t matter’ – comes into play.

For my friend Jenny it would seem that it doesn’t make too much difference when she buys and sells. I mentioned this to her, but her opinion was that because property prices are high at the moment, if she bought now she would pay more stamp duty on the purchase of a new home than she would if she waited until the market cooled.

I took that on board but was more interested in knowing why she wanted to move. They were sound reasons and many of you may identify with them.

To begin with, Jenny lives on the top floor of an old apartment building. Whilst it has a lovely outlook and is quite charming inside, it does not have an elevator. This means my friend, who is 65, has to climb a lot of stairs. Parking is also an issue as there is no garage. Jenny also babysits her young grandchildren on a regular basis, meaning she also has to carry them up and down the stairs.

Unfortunately, Jenny is having a lot of problems with her legs so she is really struggling with her current home. ‘I want to move out of Coogee to a less expensive suburb where I can buy something with a lift and a garage’, she said.

So moving for Jenny is a lifestyle decision. Moving to a different apartment would ease the burden on her legs, make it easier to park, allow her more stress-free time with her grandchildren and remove the burden of thinking about what will happen in a few years time.

I sat back and thought about it, and you can too. What price do you put on your daily enjoyment of life? Is it worth sacrificing that for the possibility of saving a bit of stamp duty? And what if the market does not come back too much - will Jenny still be talking about moving in 5 years time?

I know what I’d be doing, how about you?

"With property prices reaching all-time highs in some markets across Australia, much of our younger population continue to be locked out of the market due to increasing affordability issues that stand in the way of their home ownership dream.

On a recent trip to the United Kingdom, I undertook some research on how the younger generations in cities like London are dealing with affordability of property ownership. I looked at what strategies are being implemented and how they could be applied back here in Australia.

A popular concept in the UK is the “share the pain” principle.

As property prices continue to rise and with data showing a drop off in first time buyers – the thought of shared ownership is gathering momentum. Unless young people have access to the ‘bank of Mum and Dad’, then shared ownership could be the solution to today’s affordability constraints.

During my research in the UK, I discovered ‘Housing Associations’. In a nutshell, these are private non-profit groups that offer properties for shared ownership. To be eligible, you have to pass an income eligibility test with the bank before you can get a mortgage of 25-75% of the property's value. You purchase a share of the home and then pay rent on the remained of the property. Purchasers can then buy additional shares in the home whenever they can afford to do so until they own the home outright – this is known as ""staircasing"".

Currently, I am not aware of anything similar here in Australia, but with affordability issues continuing to be a problem for many people, I wouldn’t be surprised if something similar pops up in the near future. Until this time, an option to get past affordability issues is to pool your money with a family member (or members), or a small group of friends and use combined incomes to access finance.

A slightly more complex idea could be entering into a Joint Venture where the rules are clearly defined and the property is held jointly via a Partnership or Trust structure.

Of course, as with anything, there are advantages and disadvantages in doing this.

An obvious advantage is purchasing property and getting your foot onto the property ladder.

However, what happens if your circumstances change? How flexible is the structure or your agreement (either with family/friends or in a Joint Venture) to allow changes in personal situations, and at what cost? What happens when one party wants to sell, or can no longer afford to meet loan repayments?

Additionally, any changes in percentage of ownership of property would also affect Stamp Duty and Capital Gains Tax – however if structured correctly and the appropriate agreements are in place then this can be managed to some extent.

When a property seems financially out of reach, shared ownership could be a great solution. However, it is important that you seek independant advice before getting involved in this type of investment. 

The old fashion principles also still apply – work hard, budget and save hard – then put on your thinking cap and consider non-traditional methods of property ownership.

 ",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,Shared Ownership: Is This the Solution to Today’s Affordability Issues?
"There used to be a time when you could pretty much move into a suburb of your choice by buying at the cheaper end of the market. Then, after a while, you could move into a bigger and better property with the help of equity growth in your entry-level home, any additional savings you managed to accumulate and through increased borrowing power and affordability as your family income improved. Those were the days!

My wife and I used this strategy we first entered the property market around three decades ago. It allowed us to upgrade and move into four new family homes, including two overseas purchases. Although we were fortunate to have had a wide range of suburbs to choose from at the time, we also bought sensibly and kept within our budget. We only traded-up as our lifestyle and personal needs changed, and as our finances permitted. Back then we had the confidence that if we worked hard and saved well, we would and could move up the property ladder.

Fast forward to the present day and this situation has been turned on its head. The reality is that the top-end properties back when we started our property journey are now the equivalent of entry level homes in most metropolitan suburbs across the country. The idea that you can simply choose the location you want to live in and start at the bottom to get a leg-up onto the property ladder has been blown out of the water for many people, with things like the ever increasing cost of living, a widening deposit gap, skyrocketing property prices and record low levels of wage growth locking many people out of property markets.

So what options do you have if you find yourself priced out of a particular suburb you really want to live in? In today’s market, I think there are five key strategies you should consider…

1. Rent first, buy later

Although this strategy doesn’t solve your home ownership problem, it does allow you to live in the suburb you want and it’s a great way to really get to know the locale before buying in the area. If you end up discovering that things aren’t as rosy as you first thought and you want to move, you won’t have the commitment of a home loan or the hassle of a sale to worry about. On a more positive note, if you do like where you live and the property you live in, you may be able to transform from a tenant to owner if you and the landlord can agree a sales price.

2. Look for a different type of property

Flexibility and compromise are the mantras of today’s property buyers, which is especially the case for first-timers. If you are set on a certain location, then a smart move would be to focus on the area first and worry about the type of property second. Sure, we all have a vision of the kind of home we would like – including things such as size, number of bedrooms, off-street parking and so on, but because there’s likely to be strong competition from other like-minded buyers there may also be disappointment, particularly if other buyers are in a stronger financial position than you. If you consider buying a smaller or different type of property (such as a unit or apartment) instead of a house, you can always trade-up later. There’s likely to be demand from similarly placed buyers down the track, especially if you buy wisely.

3. Put your renovator’s hat on

Try to identify hidden value in properties that may be priced under the suburb’s median value because they’re run down or in need of modernising and updating. This approach relies on vision (that is, that you can see a property’s potential), patience (as it may take some time to get it to where you want it to be) and money (because you’re going to have to spend money to improve and add value). However, providing the property is liveable and you’re happy to put up with a bit of inconvenience, this is a great way to not only get into your chosen suburb but to build valuable equity that can be used to upgrade to a new home later. A variance to this approach would be to tear down and build a brand new home, although this would have to be carefully costed because it’s likely to be a very expensive option.

4. Look in surrounding suburbs

If you can’t afford to buy in the suburb you want, consider its surrounding suburbs. Bordering suburbs often experience the ripple effect of price increases, so you could enjoy the benefits of capital growth in a less expensive area. This could eventually help you fund your move to your desired suburb. Surrounding suburbs can be considerably cheaper and only a few kilometres away, meaning you could be no more than a 10 to 15 minute car or bus ride from where you want to be, but you’ve saved a lot of money and you’ve bought a home in the meantime.

5. Buy an investment property

If affordability is an issue, buying an investment property and having someone else help you pay off your mortgage could be a clever way to get into your chosen suburb. You can apply the same principles we discussed in my earlier column How First Home Buyers Can Get into the Property Market to help bridge the affordability and cash flow gap by buying wisely and enjoying the benefits of rental income, capital growth and an increase in equity. Additionally, if your rental property is located in your desired suburb and it is the type of property you’d like to live in, you can always do the revers of option 1 above and transform yourself from a landlord into an owner-occupier. Just remember to get independent advice as there’ll be tax issues to consider.

In closing, if you have a strong desire to buy in a particular area but cost is an issue, don’t overcommit and take on more debt than you can reasonably afford. The last thing you want is to be burdened by financial obligations that make you a slave to your mortgage.

Published: 12 Novemeber, 2015. ",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,What to do When You’re Priced Out of a Market
"One of the critical things you need to get right when putting your home or investment property on the market is setting the right asking price. Set it too low and you could miss out on extra profits; set it too high and you might scare off potential buyers and lose a sale.

Typically there’s a fine line between meeting the market and getting the price you want. There is also something else to consider: Make sure that your selling agent earns his or her commission.

In other words, while you should avoid setting an unrealistically high target, you still want an agent who can help you extract every sales dollar the market is prepared to pay.

To explore this point further let’s take a look at a typical real life example.

Assuming you are planning to sell your property on its advised sales value – which is somewhere between $480,000 and $520,000, and you have agreed on a commission of 2.5% with the selling agent (we’ll ignore marketing costs and the method of sale for the purpose of this example), the below table compares sales proceeds in $5,000 increments with commission costs, starting with a base sales price of $480,000:

SALE PRICE	CULUMATIVE
INCREMENTAL REVENUE	TOTAL
COMMISION	INCREMENTAL
COMMISION
$480,000	 n/a	$12,000	 n/a
$485,000 	$5,000	$12,125	$125
$490,000 	$10,000	$12,250	$250
$495,000 	$15,000	$12,375	$375
$500,000 	$20,000	$12,500	$500
$505,000 	$25,000	$12,625	$625
$510,000 	$30,000	$12,750	$750
$515,000 	$35,000	$12,875	$875
$520,000 	$40,000	$13,000	$1,000

The key take-away from this example is the extra $40,000 you could get by achieving the top sales price is considerably higher than the selling agent’s extra $1,000 in sales commission for achieving the same target.

This is not to say that your selling agent won’t try to get you the best result possible, but it does highlight the importance of knowing what sales target to get them to aim for because it means so much more to you, than them.

So, what can you do to make sure you set the right sales target?

In my experience there are 5 key steps you can take that will help determine a realistic asking price and help you assess the reasonableness of the selling price estimate provided by your agent...

1. Set Your Base Price

The first thing to do is work out what your minimum price is. Make sure you try and do this objectively – allowing your emotions to influence this process could cause you all sorts of problems if you don’t have realistic expectations.

A good starting point is to work out the value of the land component of your property. Land value is affected by many factors including position, shape, size, slope, topography and so on. Speak to a number of selling agents in the area to get a sense of what the median sales value per square metre of land is for your suburb. Discuss and adjust your price for anything that might add or subtract value from your property. Once you have a number, simply multiply it by your property’s square metres and you’ll get your base land value.

Next, consider what you think the structures on your property might be worth (e.g. house, unit, pool, garden, garages etc.). Add this to your base land value and you have your rough base price. You can then compare this to your minimum acceptable price to see how it stacks up.

2: Get a Property Valuation and Price Estimate

Step 1 was about getting a rough estimate. Now it’s time to be a little more commercial and scientific.

To do this, type in your address at Onthehouse.com.au and get a free valuation for your property. This will provide you with a calculated estimate on what your property could be worth, along with available property history and comparable properties in the area.

This can be a great way to help test and refine your price expectations, .however don’t forget that this valuation may not take into account any improvements you’ve made – so use this as a guide only.

You should also arrange for two or three local selling agents to provide a free property appraisal. Not only will they be able to give you some guidance on price setting, but you can also use the occasion as an opportunity to assess their commission costs, selling strategies and engagement skills – which may help you choose the agent you want to work with.

3: Compare Sold Properties

While you’re talking with selling agents, get them to provide you with a list of comparable sold properties going back over the past six months or so. Comparable means they are of a similar size, location and type. You want these comparisons to be reasonably current so they better reflect what’s happening in the market today.

You can use these lists to test things like land value, market demand and of course prices achieved. They should also be compared and contrasted with your property to help assess whether you may need to make any price adjustments.

4: Compare For Sale Properties

This is aligned with Step 3, and can also be found on Onthehouse.com.au as mentioned in Step 2 – in addition to asking local selling agents.

Looking at comparable properties that are currently listed for sale allows you to take into account what’s likely to happen as far as future sales are concerned. Not only will it give you a sense of vendor expectations but it will also give you some insights into the pricing and sales strategies of your competition.

5: Take Market Conditions into Account

Finally, you need to familiarise yourself with what’s happening in the market, including developing trends. In particular, you need to be aware of whether it’s a buyers’ or sellers’ market.

If it’s a sellers’ market it probably means you’re in a strong position and should be able to achieve the top end (or higher) of your price range. However, in a buyers’ market, you may have to negotiate and possibly lower your price expectations if you’re keen to sell.

To get a handle on where the market is sitting, research your suburb here. Also read the latest finance and property articles and reports, and talk to local selling agents. Doing all of these things will provide you with useful guidance and insights.

As a final thought, remember that, at the end of the day, the market will determine what your property is worth. If you want a successful sale, it is important that you and the market are on the same page.

"The big four banks announced in October that they are increasing home loan interest rates, and now other lenders are following their lead. If you’re not happy with these changes, maybe it’s time to do something about it.

Gone are the days when people would get a home loan and stay with the same lender for the full 25 or 30 year loan term. In Australia, the average homeowner changes their loan every four to five years because people continually seek a better deal, which is a very good thing.

There isn’t a one size fits all approach to how often you should refinance, but every borrower should be aware of the market and do regular home loan health checks every 12 months or so. Whether you then take the plunge to refinance should be based on some of these considerations.

Costs of refinancing

While refinancing is ultimately done to save you money over the long term, it will generally cost you some money in the process. Make sure you understand all the costs involved so you can work out whether the amount saved in interest over time will be greater than the refinance cost.

Locked into a fixed rate

If you have a fixed rate home loan, breaking the agreement may add further costs, which can be hefty depending how far into the fixed term you are and the size of the loan. A mortgage broker can help you ascertain what the break costs (if any) would be.

Your interest rate

If you regularly see advertised interest rates more than 0.5% less than your current interest rate, it might be worth considering a change or at least asking your lender for a better rate.

Changing goals and needs

Over time your goals and needs change so it’s important to make sure your home loan is still right for you. Is it flexible enough and does it have the features you need, like an offset account to reduce your interest, or the option of an interest only home loan for your investment property? Planning a renovation or accessing some equity might also be reasons to refinance.

Before taking the plunge make sure you:

Know what your current interest rate is;
Know if it’s a fixed interest rate and if so, when the fixed term ends;
Speak to your lender and find out what is the best rate they can offer you and what it will cost to exit your current loan; and
Get an expert second opinion from an accredited mortgage broker like Aussie to find out what other lenders could offer you. A mortgage broker can also help you calculate all the costs involved in refinancing and help with the paperwork.

"Market Update

Growth in the Melbourne house market has outperformed Sydney by 2.8 percentage points in the October quarter – with 6.84% growth.

The latest data shows that Melbourne is now following Sydney’s lead in terms of strong capital growth – with the median house value now sitting at $729,500.

This result suggests that Melbourne is coming into its peak growth rate, as the east coast markets historically follow a pattern – Sydney will lead the market, followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane. This can be seen in Graph 1.

Graph 1: East Coast Capital City Growth

Looking at Graph 1, an obvious example of the lead lag effect can be seen between 2003 and 2004 when growth in Sydney experienced a sharp decline, which was followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane.

Cyclically, Melbourne capital growth should cool in a few months then Brisbane may experience a peak in growth following this. The summer months should see lower growth rates, particularly in Brisbane where the market is susceptible to seasonality.

Structurally, however, growth in Melbourne and Brisbane may be limited by Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) intervention to curb investor home loans.

Table 1 presents the results for October.

Table 1: October Statistics Summary

The data indicates that Sydney has peaked in this particular growth cycle. While houses in this market are still increasing in value, quarterly growth in October (4.04%) was significantly lower than the 7.58% achieved in the July quarter.

Western Australia has experienced a significant drop in dwelling values and rental income in the year to October 2015 – in both the house and unit markets of Perth and Country WA. With commodity prices forecast to remain subdued, dwellings in Perth could experience a correction and may eventually stabilise above pre-mining boom levels.

The data also shows that houses in the ACT performed well in the year to October, however these statistics alone could be misleading.

A ‘boost’ in the ACT dwelling market followed the discovery of the dangerous exposure to asbestos in many homes. By June 2015, the government had purchased back 600 homes – which also contributed to increased activity in this market. This action reduced the supply of housing and forced people to participate in the housing market with the money received from the sale of their property to the government.

In spite of strong growth performance in the ACT house market, unit growth has remained close to zero since 2012.

Investment: The New Normal

Before APRA intervention, low interest rates enabled existing home owners with strong purchasing power. This was due to being able to access any built up equity[1] to fund a deposit on another property purchase, as opposed to aspiring home owners having to overcome a deposit hurdle.

Related Article: What to do When You’re Priced Out of a Market

This means that any time property values in Sydney went up, purchasing power for existing home owners in this market also went up. The ability to use equity in an existing property to bid on another created a strong wealth effect for people who were asset rich.

Housing finance data from the ABS shows a significant drop off in investor lending – from a peak of $15.50 AUD billion in June 2015 to $12.53 AUD billion in September 205. This follows the implementation of restrictive lending policies to investors, as APRA required lending institutions to hold more capital against increasingly risky home loans.

Graph 2: Investor Home Loans

Source: ABS Catalogue Number 5609.0 - Housing Finance, Australia, Sep 2015

The median Sydney house is now valued at $1,058,000. Anecdotal evidence suggests that first home buyers, particularly in Sydney, are now entering the market as investors because this is the only way they are able to afford property – using tenants to help pay off their mortgage.

With home loan rates and deposit requirements increasing, those choosing to invest may turn to more affordable capital city markets. With this in mind, it is worth considering the impact this trend could have on these other more affordable markets.

Could investors who are out-priced of Sydney, who are investing in other cities, out-price locals in these other markets?

Sydney has one of the highest median household incomes across the capital cities at over $80,000 per annum. Combine this with the ability to take equity out of highly valued Sydney properties and it is easy to see how Sydney investors could drive up prices in other cities through speculation.

It is important to remember that an area does not hold long term growth prospects just because it is relatively affordable and people have started investing there. This is especially the case where macroeconomic growth prospects over the next 12 months are not strong.

Across Australia, wage growth is low at 2.3% for the September quarter and unemployment has come down to 5.9% for October – but remains high relative to the 10 year average (5.2%). This has implications for both dwelling affordability and the amount of rental income tenants can afford to provide for investment properties. Those wanting to invest interstate should keep this in mind as they commit to markets that are largely driven by speculative growth.

"Interest-only loans are typically marketed to cash strapped borrowers as an attractive alternative to the standard principal and interest (or amortising) loan. One of the supposed benefits is that monthly repayments are lower because there is no requirement to make capital repayments during the interest-only period.

While this may seem tempting, especially if money is a bit tight and a lower loan repayment is the difference between being an actual or wannabe property owner or investor, on closer examination these loans can be risky and could even cause serious financial and personal problems down the track.

In my experience, there are three key risks borrowers face when they take out an interest only loan:

1. There’s no debt reduction
2. You could face a repayment shock
3. You’re likely to incur higher interest costs.

Let’s demonstrate each risk with an example. Let’s assume you could get a loan for $400,000, at 5% interest over 25 years, and you have the option of an amortising loan from day one or an interest-only loan for the first 10 years – after which it would convert to normal principal and interest repayments. Let’s also assume the interest rate stays the same for the life of the loan.

Risk 1: No debt reduction

The below table shows the stark contrast between what would happen to your loan balance if you opted for a 10 year interest-only loan compared with an amortising loan. In fact, nothing would happen as your loan balance would remain unchanged. However, if you had chosen an amortising loan you would have paid off $104,303 – which is over a quarter of what you originally borrowed.

Table 1

For me, this is a major issue with interest-only loans. Not only will you carry the same level of debt for an extended period, but what’s equally worrying is that you aren’t building any equity in your property through debt reduction. If things go wrong, such as a drop in the value of your property or if you face financial difficulties, you won’t get the benefit of an equity buffer that would have occurred naturally if you had been making capital repayments from day one.

Risk 2: Repayment shock

Once the interest-only period ends, you will be required to make what I call “accelerated principal and interest repayments”. These are accelerated because they are over a shorter time frame. In the example, you only have 15 years to pay off your principal balance (i.e. after the interest-only period ends), and not the original 25 years. As Table 2 shows, this means your monthly repayments are going to be considerably higher after 10 years.

Table 2

The above analysis tells us that while you could “save” around $671 a month during the interest-only period ($2,338 - $1,667), you will end up paying a lot more from year 11 onwards. In fact, it’s an extra $1,496 a month ($3,163 - $1,667), or 90% more than your interest-only repayments. Such a significant hike in loan repayments could be beyond your reach, leading to possible and avoidable financial difficulties.

Risk 3: Higher interest costs

It might not seem obvious but you could end up paying considerably more in interest, because the average loan balance is higher.

In the example, there is a 10 year interest-only period where the loan balance stays the same, whereas, if you were making principal and interest payments, the balance would be reducing (see Table 3).

Table 3

In our example you’d pay an extra $67,863 ($369,371 - $301,508) in interest if you opted for interest-only repayments. This highlights that these types of loans can be considerably more expensive, and while they might save a few bucks in the short-term, overall you are likely to be much worse off.

Conclusion

The risks associated with interest-only loans should not be underestimated, and you may end up needing to take steps to mitigate these risks, which could undermine the supposed benefits of these type of loans – such as setting aside extra cash during the interest-only period to help absorb the higher costs of future repayments, or even having to sell the property if repayments end up exceeding what you can reasonably affordable.

For all of the reasons discussed above, it is probably a good idea to try and stay clear of interest-only loans wherever possible. However, if you are thinking of taking one out, make sure you get independent advice and compare the overall costs with alternative loan types. Also, importantly, try and keep an interest-only period to no longer than one or two years as this will help reduce the financial risks and cash flow impact when you have to start making capital repayments.

Published: 4 Novemeber, 2015. ",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,BEWARE: The Dangers of Interest-Only Loans
"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will hold the cash rate at 2% at its November Board Meeting.

Many predicted a rate cut or hold to be plausible, with Australia’s economy underperforming. However, there is a limit to the power of monetary policy as commodity prices remain subdued, China reports a five year low in GDP growth and uncertainty has prompted the Federal Reserve to leave its rates on hold.

One of the main factors giving the RBA room to maintain a low cash rate of 2% was tighter regulations from the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) around housing lending.

On notice from APRA, the ‘big four’ banks have begun limiting home loans to investors. Each of the big four have increased their variable home loan rates over the last few weeks. This will enable major lending institutions to reserve more capital against increasingly risky housing markets.

Table 1: Increase in Home Loan Rates by the Big Four

The structural intervention has triggered a downswing in the Sydney market. According to the latest data from Onthehouse.com.au, 21 Sydney suburbs lost value in the unit market in the September quarter, while 19 suburbs saw house values decline, although mostly by only 1 to 2%.

Related Article: Macquarie Bank’s Estimated 7.5% Drop Should NOT Be Interpreted as a Bubble Bursting

Increased variable home loan rates and slowed growth suggests that the cash rate cut will not affect real estate demand. However, there is a need to stimulate the economy.

Annual GDP growth slowed to 2% in the June quarter, down from 2.5% in the previous quarter.

The Chinese economy experienced just 6.9% growth in the year to September – the lowest GDP growth rate recorded in over five years. As China accounts for approximately 30% of the value of Australia’s exports, the news of slowed economic growth from China has negatively impacted consumer and business confidence, and the balance of trade fell further in the month of August.

The Australian Stock Exchange Index has trended down since August 2015. After making a modest recovery in October, the index fell further, closing at 5174 on 1 November. This indicates bearish investor attitudes towards the Australian market.

The unemployment rate remained unchanged in September – at 6.2%, and the participation rate fell 0.12 percentage points to 64.86%.

Wage growth in Australia slowed in the first quarter of 2015 to 2.3% for the year. This could be a result of increased casualization in Australia’s workforce, with approximately 30% of the labour force working in non-full time positions. Research from overseas labour markets suggests that, where casualization is high, workers are likely to bargain for more hours than higher wages.

Slowed growth from the US further necessitates the possibility of a future cash rate cut. The Federal Reserve held off increasing official interest rates at its October meeting, meaning the USD is at risk of falling. A fall in the USD leads to relative strength in the AUD, which makes Australia’s exports more expensive. A cash rate cut by the RBA early next year may help to de-value the AUD in response to these potential movements, if the economy does not improve.

Australia’s low inflation rate (which was unchanged in September from 1.5% in the previous quarter) also gives the RBA room to cut interest rates. The RBA has an inflation target of 2 to 3%, to theoretically achieve full employment in the economy.

However, as seen recently in the US and Japan, inflation and unemployment do not always have an inverse relationship. A lack of confidence in the economy can outweigh the spending that the RBA attempts to encourage through a low cash rate. This limits the extent to which monetary policy can positively affect the economy.

"The Melbourne Cup – the race that stops a nation. The best time to bet on a horse you think is going to win is before it becomes the favourite. The same theory can be applied to property.

The best time to buy into a suburb is before it becomes popular and prices start to take off. If you arrive late, not only will you have to pay more due to increased demand but the opportunity for short-term capital growth may diminish significantly because of the accelerated increase in property median values, and medium-term growth will flatten as prices start to stabilise once the heat is taken out of the market.

The trick is to be able to identify suburbs before they become ‘hot’ – meaning before they experience a dynamic and upward shift in demand putting them on par with the better established and popular areas. A good place to start your research is with Onthehouse.com.au's research a suburb tool - which will provide a snapshot of what's happening in a selected market. 

To help you find a hidden gem, here are my top tips on how to identify the signs that a property is about to become a winner…

Look for the ripple effect

When property buyers can’t buy in the area they want, either due to affordability or availability, they’ll often buy in adjacent suburbs as an alternative. When this happens, demand increases in those suburbs which in turns pushes up prices and the price-ripple effect occurs. This is especially prevalent around capital cities and major regional centres. So, keep an eye out for strongly performing suburbs and consider the capital growth potential in surrounding areas.

Look for investment in infrastructure

Keep an eye out for announcements about major infrastructure investments on things like roads, transport and schools. This is a sign of a growing population and therefore a growing demand for services, like housing. Infrastructure programs can sometimes take years to complete, meaning if you buy sooner rather than later you will benefit when the wave of housing demand hits.

Look for announcements from business and government

When a large business or government entity announces it is about to set up a major operation in a particular area, this is a signal that jobs and population growth may not be far behind. However, there are two important points to remember in these situations:

Never buy on the strength of a single initiative, because if that business or government entity decides not to invest or pulls out early, property values are likely to head south very quickly as employment opportunities disappear along with the organisation.


If the announcement is part of a regeneration plan for the area there is probably an existing workforce and housing stock available, so capital growth may not be as great as what would otherwise be the case. It’s always a good idea to check the facts about major projects and the current and forecast economic and employment situation within a suburb or region before buying.
Look for changing demographics

A major shift in the social or demographic makeup of a suburb can have a big impact on property values. For instance, if a suburb changes from being predominantly single occupancy to more family orientated, this will drive demand for multi-bedroom homes with gardens – which means prices for these types of properties will rise accordingly. The key is to understand what’s driving the demographic change (e.g. immigration, population shift, employment opportunities) and to make sure it is a long-lasting one.

Look for changes in property rental data

There are three key ratios that every property investor should keep an eye on and movements in these ratios can indicate positive or negative movements in the value of an investment:

1. Vacancy trends

Low vacancy rates (i.e. under 3%) means there is an undersupply of property and strong rental demand, which is good for capital growth. However, if vacancy rates start increasing it means more stock is on the market, there are fewer tenants and there is less demand – which could be an indication that the suburb is no longer desirable.

2. Yield trends

Suburbs with yield trends that are flat or rising could mean property prices are stagnant or even falling. Other things being equal, it makes sense to stay clear of these suburbs until market conditions show signs of sustained improvement.

3. Owner/renter trends

Ideally, you should look for suburbs where the owner-to-renter ratio is at least 2:1. This is because owners tend to take better care of their properties, which in turn helps enhance and increase the desirability for an area. An ongoing deterioration in this ratio could mean owner-occupiers are leaving – which may not be good news for property values.

Look for changes in sales data

Analysing recent sales data could reveal early indications of changes in underlying demand for a suburb. The key measures to consider are:

1. Days on market

This measures how long it is taking vendors to sell their properties. If the measure is going down, it either means demand is high and/or the pricing is right; and the converse applies. A downward trend may mean the suburb is hotting up.

2. Discounts offered

Generally speaking, the lower the discount the easier it is to sell the property – meaning demand is good. If discount levels are flat and falling this is a good sign. Just be mindful that the level of discount might reflect the reasonableness of the asking price.

3. Auction clearance rates

If auction clearance rates are holding or increasing it is a sign that demand is strong. Again, be careful as it could also reflect competitive vendor price setting and the skill of the auctioneer. However, when this is compared with prices achieved, it will give a clear indication of whether prices are on the up.

Look for street hot spots

Slightly off-topic but nonetheless important. There will be occasions when it makes sense to focus on a street within a suburb. This is especially is the case where the suburb might be popular or up and coming, but a particular street is not. Keep an eye out for streets where property values are less than the suburb’s median value. As more and more people enter the market they may eventually, due to supply and demand factors, come looking in these otherwise less popular streets.

Published: 2 Novemeber, 2015. ",2021_04_23,3-May-17,N/A,Pick a Winner in the Property Race
"Some people refuse to attend auctions, citing the chances of paying too much as a reason to let the property go. There are also some who find them intimidating, terrified they’ll inadvertently raise a hand at the wrong moment.

Of course, one way of winning at auction is to win before it starts!

Just because a property is due to be auctioned on a particular date, don’t be put off – you can always submit an offer to the seller and see how they respond. Sellers sometimes prefer to take it off the market before it reaches auction, as it’s quicker and more cost-effective.

However, there can be times when bidding at auction is the only way to get your hands on a particular property, and it pays to know what you’re doing before you turn up, to make sure you get the most out of your experience – and, preferably, the property you want at the price you’re prepared to pay!

It’s amazing how many attendees are unaware of some of the most significant rules surrounding auctions in Australia. Astonishingly, a recent Slater & Gordon survey revealed that 42 per cent of potential bidders didn’t know that there isn’t a cooling-off period when buying a property at auction.

NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE

Buyers’ worries are understandable to buyers’ agent Patrick Bright.

“I think fear’s a justifiable emotion given the large sums of money involved.

“There are no cheap mistakes when it comes to buying and selling property, just very expensive lessons, which is why it pays to do lots of research and seek professional help if it’s available.”

Bright has seen many buyers avoid the gavel at all costs.

“Most people who engage my services tell me they’re not interested in attending auctions for two key reasons: firstly, they don’t want to waste any more time and money on building and pest inspections or strata reports on underquoted properties; secondly, they incorrectly think that in order to buy at auction they’ll have to pay over the odds, which is just not the case.

Related Article: How $400 Saved $600,000 Worth of Heartache

“Many of the best buys I’ve made below fair value were purchased at auction.”

One Real Estate’s Karl Secondis has been an auctioneer for 20 years and he too believes it doesn’t have to be scary.

“Doing your homework is important,” he says. “And sometimes doing your homework is difficult, because the agent you’re dealing with may not have a great deal of information… this is my experience – there are a lot of agents that don’t have a lot of information available, which makes it hard for buyers to do their research.

“I think it’s important to remove all the mystery about the property and help the buyer understand very clearly what it is they’re buying before they attend the auction.”

Due diligence, then, is at least as critical with an auction as with any other type of sale, if not more. But does it have to cost a stack of money? Not according to Secondis.

“Some agents (including myself) are recommending to the owner to invest in the cost of reports before the property goes onto the market, so the buyer doesn’t have to pay…

“If that report’s not available,” he adds, “certainly I’d encourage a buyer to talk with his conveyancing agent about the benefits of doing some reports prior to the auction.” 

BE PREPARED

Other key jobs for bidders before auction day, according to Bright, include the same things you’d be getting in order before signing on the dotted line for a standard house purchase.

“Prior to auction, buyers need to have the contract reviewed by their solicitor,” he says, adding, “review a building and pest inspection or strata report on the property and ensure you have your finance pre-approval in place, which covers the well researched and pre-determined limit you set as your maximum bidding amount.”

Another good preparatory tactic is to attend a few auctions for properties in which you’ve no interest, in order to familiarise yourself with the process. It’ll help you learn how things unfold on auction day and ensure you’re not turning up completely green.

Related Article: 10 Signs a Property Has Problems

“You certainly see it from time to time where people will attend an auction without any sort of preparation and they’ll put their hand up and be successful,” Secondis says. “A lot of people don’t realise there’s a very big distinction between a normal contract and an auction contract. There’s no cooling off, no finance clause, no building clauses – it’s very tight.

“I’d call people a little bit naïve who attend an auction without any preparation and then bid. You can certainly put yourself in hot water.

“There’s a little saying – ‘Once the hammer drops, the fun stops’.”

Once you’ve conducted your inspections, examined the contract, checked out the property’s history and compared local like-for-like prices, you’re pretty set for the big day, where you need to slap on the poker face and warm up those arm muscles.

While some experts insist you should never bid on a property until it reaches reserve, their argument is a little flawed considering auctioneers are under no obligation to divulge that a property has reached reserve.

Secondis believes enthusiasm is key and that you can leave the poker face at home: “Bid with confidence – don’t be shy to show your cards.

“A lot of people sit back to see what’s going to happen. Well, if everybody has that approach, nothing’ll happen!”

He’s also a believer in going in big, a risky tactic that could see you overpay, but can also show the other bidders that you mean business.

“If you’ve got an $800,000 budget and the bidding’s at $700,000, don’t be afraid to say ‘Look, I’ll give you $750K…’ it might psychologically spook other people.

“You really want to put yourself in the box seat – be the highest bidder and you’ll have first option at the property [if the reserve hasn’t been met].”

If you’re not the highest bidder, he says, you can find yourself sitting in the shadows, waiting for the auctioneer and agent to deal with the highest bidder.

Bright, however, says that’s a myth.

“A common misconception is that the highest bidder has the first right to buy the property if it’s passed in,” he says.

“In fact it’s not a hard and fast written rule, it’s simply a line used to get buyers to continue to bid and it works, which is why auctioneers say it.”

His advice is not to fear the pass-in.

“If you’re confident, and an experienced negotiator, don’t be afraid to let the property pass in as it can be a real psychological chess move.

“Many times I’ve seen how a vendor with a passed-in property reacts and it’s often not rational. They end up lowering their reserve to get a sale and remove the embarrassment of not achieving a sale.

“Always keep in mind,” Bright adds, “that, especially in post-auction negotiations, there’s more pressure on the seller than the buyer – the seller only has one property to sell but the buyer could buy one of several.

“The property’s just failed at auction and if they had a better offer, they wouldn’t be talking to you right now.” 

TRUE STORY

When things go wrong at auction it can be pretty serious, but it can also be pretty amusing.

Bright says: “I’ve seen auctions stopped due to aircraft noise being too strong to hear the auctioneer just after he’d said ‘there’s great value here today, buyers, in this lovely quiet street’!

“I’ve seen a buyer take off after the hammer had fallen in his favour, and once I had to essentially sit on a client in a cuddling fashion to hold her arms down to stop her from bidding.

“It’s one of the reasons I suggest my more emotional clients wait in a coffee shop down the road!”

THE RULES

You need to know the law when you rock up to an auction – especially if you’re intending to bid!

Auction rules are governed by each individual state and territory – and some rules are state-specific – so you should always check the guidelines with the state government or Real Estate Institute of the state/territory in which you’re bidding. Many property auction rules, however, are standard across Australia.

ALL STATES

The most important rule is there’s no cooling-off period at auction! Winning on auction day means you’re legally bound to purchase that dwelling. You can’t make your offer subject to finance or other conditions (unless agreed, via contract, with the vendor beforehand).

Bidders must register their name and address before the auction commences in order to have their bid considered.

Auctioneers set the bidding advances, but you can offer an alternative incremental amount if you wish.

An auctioneer isn’t obliged to inform bidders when the reserve price has been met. It’s worth asking, but many auctioneers won’t disclose it.

Vendor bid. The seller of the property is allowed to have a bid or bids submitted on his or her behalf. This bid must be announced as such by the auctioneer.

Dummy bids. A false bid submitted by a friend of the seller or a plant in the crowd who has no intention of purchasing the property. They’re designed to help push the price higher. Dummy bidding is illegal but it still takes place.

PRE-AUCTIONS Dos and DON'Ts

DOs

View the property: Attend a viewing in person – before the day of the auction – to ensure the property’s not a dud.

Check it out: Compare like properties within the suburb to make sure it’s likely to stay within your budget. Research recently sold properties in the area. As with any other potential purchase, exercise due diligence.

Show interest: Let the agent know you’re interested in the property beforehand and ask them to inform you of any offers made. 

DON’Ts

Be hesitant: Be a confident bidder and don’t give anything away (eg. your top price). And don’t let the pressure get to you.

Get carried away: No matter how much you like and want the property, don’t let your head rule your heart. It’s too easy to raise your hand in the air, but not so easy to raise the extra money if you overbid.

Bid against yourself: Offering further negotiation before an offer or bid has been made to counter yours. It sounds unlikely, but many people succumb to this mistake.

"Economic Overview

The Australian economy is underperforming due to continued declines in commodity prices and global economic growth.

While the Reserve Bank opted to keep the official cash on hold at its November Board Meeting, another cut is on the cards – expected by mid-2016. The timing of a further interest rate cut largely depends on when the US Federal Reserve decides to raise its rates. A rise in the USD would lead to a relative fall in the AUD, which is a desirable outcome for competitiveness in Australian exports. This may hold off a further rate cut in Australia this year.

Related Article: RBA Leaves Rates on Hold in November

If the Federal Reserve maintains interest rates the USD is at risk of falling, which would undermine competitiveness of Australian firms and potentially trigger a further rate cut by the RBA within the next few months. However, it is troubling that the ‘positive’ element of Australia’s economy cited in media is the weakness of the dollar, which averaged US $0.71 in September. As well as making Australia’s goods and services relatively cheap, a low dollar signals a lack of confidence in the Australian economy.

Annual GDP growth slowed to 2% in the June quarter, down from 2.5% in the previous quarter. Unemployment in September was 6.2%, while the participation rate also fell from 65.09% in August to 64.86% in September.

As discussed last month, poor economic performance is not always reflected in the housing market in the short term. This is particularly the case on the east coast, where markets have performed counter cyclically. In fact, besides in Perth and Darwin, most housing markets across Australia grew in the September quarter. Table 1 presents the summary of growth for the month ending October.

Table 1: September Market Summary

 

Part of the explanation for counter-cyclical performance is the investment and lending frameworks that further wealth, even in times of stagnating wage and GDP growth. While purchasing power should diminish in the face of rising house values, those who own a house will find their wealth going up. The ability to borrow against the equity in a home has staved off a downturn in the market. Academic consensus is that favourable tax treatment of investors has also prolonged the Sydney housing boom.

The East Coast Downturn

Quarterly growth in Melbourne was strong, with house values increasing by 5.25% and unit values rising 2.58%. Brisbane also showed steady quarterly growth, of 3.13% and 1.42% in the house and unit market respectively. Growth surges in Melbourne and Brisbane are expected to continue as these markets follow the movements of Sydney, however at a more subdued level.

Sydney growth is slowing, with many suburbs showing a contraction in growth for the September quarter.

Related Article: Sydney's Property Evolution

Graph 1 shows 5 years of quarterly growth rates in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane for the median house. The quarterly growth rate is taken at each month in the data set.

Graph 1: Quarterly Capital Growth

The graph shows a contraction in these markets around 2011-2012, and then growth moves upward. It is also evident that Sydney tends to lead the way and peak before Melbourne and Brisbane. The last data point in this graph suggests that growth is continuing in the Sydney market but at a slower pace than its peak earlier in the year.

The next 12 months should see slowed or negative growth rates in Sydney. However, this should not be interpreted as a crash. Macquarie Wealth Group recently made headlines stating that dwelling prices across Australia may fall as much as 7.5% in the next 2 years – but it is important to remember that this is off the back of a 41.36% value increase in Sydney houses and a 31.59% value increase in Sydney units since 2013. Downswings are a part of life and whether the Sydney market undergoes some sort of severe crash will likely depend on the availability of jobs and income growth in the future.

Related Article: Macquarie Bank’s Estimated 7.5% Drop Should NOT Be Interpreted as a Bubble Bursting

Evidence from overseas markets shows that macro-prudential policy plays an important role in triggering a downswing. In Australia, it is being used to counter growth in the housing sector as the official cash rate declines. Increases in housing investment and risk prompted the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to make sure the banks changed their internal risk modelling to reflect this – property risk weights must be increased from 16 to 25%. The announcement was made in July 2015 and will be enforced from July 2016.

The implication of this is that the major banks, who use their own risk modelling to determine the amount of capital they hold, must adopt this new weighting. With the major banks typically underestimating the risk weight of property in their internal models, APRA’s regulations will require banks to hold billions of dollars more in reserves to safeguard the financial system.

The cost (for the banks) of holding more capital is passed onto consumers who take out loans for houses. These costs come in the form of higher deposits and higher interest rates. The oligopolistic structure of the banking sector allows all of the big banks to increase interest rates almost simultaneously, in order to raise more capital. The table below shows the recent rate increases from each bank.

Table 2: October Increases in Home Loan Rates

The Long Term

There is a long term risk of unaffordability in mortgage repayments. Australian’s have high levels of private debt, with housing debt sitting at approximately $1.5 trillion dollars[1]. Australia’s GDP is only $1.453 trillion, meanings housing debt currently represents approximately 103% of GDP.

Given the low cash rate, it is relatively easy to service large amounts of debt. Furthermore, interest rates are likely to stay low for a long time, as other countries have set precedent (the US official cash rate has remained unchanged from 0.25% since 2008). However, interest rates will not stay low forever.

APRA has recommended the use of stress testing home loan rates of up to 7%. It is important to consider whether, especially for owner occupiers who do not receive rental income, dwellings are truly affordable.

The international standard of affordability is a measure called the ‘Median Multiple’, designed by the World Bank. It is found by dividing median dwelling prices by gross annual median household income. An indicator of 5 or more is considered to be highly unaffordable.

Graph 2 shows the Median Multiple Indicator for each capital city market for houses. To create our own version of this measure, I have used median house values divided by median household incomes for each capital city[2].

Graph 2: Median Multiple Indicator

For each region, with the exception of the ACT[3], houses in capital city markets are highly unaffordable relative to incomes. If wage growth continues to fall and interest rates rise in the long term, it will be harder for households to repay large amounts of debt. Further exacerbating the situation are subdued commodity prices, which the International Monetary Fund expect to hover around the current low prices for the next 5 years.

Australia is not making a smooth transition into other sectors following the mining downturn, despite the services sector being touted for future growth potential in the wake of free trade opportunities. HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham spoke positively on education exports earning $18 billion over the past year. However, this is a relatively small figure considering that all merchandise exports were worth approximately $21 billion in the month of August alone. In addition, the rate of growth in the value of merchandise exports is declining.

The Australian government faces serious challenges in finding competitive, sustainable sectors of employment for its labour force, especially as the economy is exposed to free trade with economic powerhouses such as China and the US through separate trade agreements.

"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again – if you’re serious about buying residential property, regardless of whether you’re an investor or owner-occupier, make sure you get an independent pre-purchase property inspection done before you sign on the dotted line.

It is important that you make this a top priority. Just because a property looks good on the outside doesn’t mean it isn’t hiding serious existing or future problems that are not obvious to the untrained eye and, depending on their severity of the problems, these can be very expensive to fix.

Related Article: 10 Signs a Property Has Problems

Some friends of mine shared my view and wisely arranged for a combined structural and pest inspection to be carried out on three separate properties they were considering buying as their new home. This was a modest investment of around $400 for each inspection, which, given the scale of the problems they uncovered, turned out to be a great decision.

Here is a summary of costs to repair/replace problems the inspections uncovered across the three properties:

 

Even with my experience, I find these estimates to be mind-bogglingly breathtaking, especially for the first property. Imagine if you had unknowingly bought one of these properties and then got landed with the quantum of these repair bills? I think it would pretty much destroy the average person, especially if they stretched themselves to their financial limit to make the purchase in the first place.

So, what sort of things did the inspection reports uncover?

Without going into detail, let’s start with locations. All three properties were in the same popular inner-Melbourne suburb, which is close to things like the city, shops, cafés, nightlife and transport. Basically, the area is very popular for downsizing working couples who like to socialise and have some fun. However, this particular suburb also has a history of problems, especially with its older period properties, caused mainly by ongoing water and drainage issues. These problems caused damage like rotting wood, warping and consequent major structural defects. These period properties were highly sought after, meaning they retained strong market values regardless of their state of repair, which meant there wasn’t much room for price negotiation. In addition to this, compounding matters for the first property was that it was heritage listed – meaning it had to be repaired and returned to its former state – hence the incredible repair costs.

Needless to say, once my friends considered the reports and got the repair estimates, they walked away. Even though they had spent a total of around $1,200 on total inspection costs, it saved them considerable heartache and even financial ruin. Importantly, the inspections had revealed issues they probably would not have picked up, even if they had done a more thorough investigation themselves.

As an aside, another smart move my friends made was that once they realised the recurring problems in the area, they spoke with neighbours to learn if they had had faced similar issues, how often they occurred and how much it cost them to fix. This provided valuable learnings and insights, and also helped them become a little savvier when it came to choosing a street, assessing properties and whether to get an independent inspection done.

I think the benefits and lessons learned from this real life example are self-evident and a sober reminder to be cautious, especially when considering older properties or when buying in suburbs with a history of problems. At the very least, inspection reports can provide you with the peace of mind that you are making a major financial and emotional commitment with your eyes wide open.

In closing, let’s summarise the benefits of a pre-purchase inspection:

They help you make better and more informed decisions when buying a property and choosing between alternative properties.


They can reveal problems the average person may miss. In particular, the ensuing report can be used to either continue discussions or walk away from a property.


The costs of fixing defects can be used to negotiate the price down or otherwise get more favourable terms.


An inspection can reveal potential future problems that can be planned for, quantified and funded. If carried out appropriately, it can help prolong the life of the building and other structures, as well as help maintain heritage, appeal and charm.


A side benefit is that the report could be used to inform renovation or extension opportunities.

A very important thought to remember – if you plan to buy under auction conditions, make sure you get a property inspection done before you bid. Auctions are unconditional and cannot be made subject to remedying subsequently discovered defects.

"In July, state and federal leaders met to discuss funding and tax reform. High on the agenda was raising the GST rate, particularly as many state governments are facing massive funding shortfalls in education and health over the coming years.

There has been support among state leaders for various changes. Michael Baird is said to favour a GST rise to 15%, with the extra funds going to health and lower households effected. Two Labor Premiers are against a rise and are looking for an increase in Medicare levies. Others are looking for a slight adjustment from 10% to 12.5%.

Whatever the case, it seems fairly obvious that at some point in the future the GST rate will be increased. Generally speaking, the GST is seen as a regressive tax, which basically means that people on lower incomes are impacted more. Those on higher incomes pay more tax but it is in a lower proportion of their total income, and of course fresh food, education and health care are exempt from GST.

Related Article: Bad News for the Australian Economy?

So, the question property investors should be asking is ‘how will an increase in GST impact the property market?’

Firstly – a positive. Increasing the GST to raise the necessary revenue takes the focus away from raising revenue in other areas – especially the easy pickings in federal and state taxes associated with land and property, such as abolishing negative gearing, land taxes and stamp duties.

In recent times, there has been some discussion on property taxes. A recent paper released by the Grattan Institute finds that a modest property levy of just $2 for every $1,000 of unimproved land value would raise $7 billion a year for state governments. The annual charge on the median-priced home in Sydney would be $772, in Melbourne $560, and lower in other cities and regions. A broad-based property levy could help plug the gap for schools and hospitals left by the Commonwealth’s decision to cut funding in these areas from 2017-18.

Based on historical price trends over the past two decades, revenues from a levy on unimproved land values could double to as much as $14 billion by 2024-25, offsetting much of the projected shortfall from Commonwealth cuts.

However, the major impact on an increase in GST is what it may do to property prices in the short term. At the moment, we are seeing a surge in development across capital cities in Australia – particularly in Sydney and Melbourne where values are at all-time highs – to meet the pent up demand for housing. Developers are now making reasonable margins on building, especially with low interest rates making the risk/return beneficial. This also means that housing stock is more readily viable, taking away the need for government investment in public housing. But this could all change with an increase in the GST.

If you understand how the GST works, additional GST would normally be passed onto the final consumer or claimed back from the government. However, in the case of property development, the additional cost is borne by the party (the developer) before the final consumer. Developers don’t have another consumer in the supply chain. This seems like good news for home buyers as they won’t have to pay GST when purchasing a new home, however it wouldn’t be unreasonable to think that developers will try to build the additional tax into the final sale price.

Once again, this will depend on supply and demand of the market. Developers may not be able to simply raise the property sale price by 5% to recoup the GST if the market does not accept that price, and hence they will have to wear this cost. Remember also that GST does not impact old housing stock, so it could also be conceivable that developers are competing with existing housing for sale that has no GST.

For example, and we’ll excluding the margin scheme for the purpose of this example, take a modest $500,000 new home or unit in Australia today.

The purchaser is paying 1/11th of this purchase in GST, which is around $45,500. Plus, depending on which state the home is bought in, there is anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 paid in stamp duty.

Related Article: Will Australia’s Changing Trade Position Boost Dwelling Values?

If the GST was raised to 15% as an example, the purchase of a $500,000 property jumps by approximately $23,000 overnight. As mentioned, an existing dwelling purchase experiences no change in tax treatment, so the new home buyer is now potentially paying $522,727 for this house – of which around $68,100 is GST. Add to this the various infrastructure charges, duties and taxes or levies, and people buying a new home in this scenario could easily be paying well over $150,000 in total taxes.

If developers cannot pass the extra cost of the GST onto the buyer, they will have to pay the GST themselves. This will significantly reduce their profit margin, potentially putting them under financial stress, making them reconsider their next project.

Lessons learnt from when the GST was first introduced many years ago include the initial knock on effects on the values of existing housing stock, and that developers endured a reduction in profit margins due to not being able to pass on the full amount of GST to the buyer, which meant that construction of new housing slowed.

In my view, an increase in GST could see a further short term stoking of the ambers of an already heated property market. This is worrying a lot of people from the Reserve Bank, from the Governor down.

Related Article: 10 Signs a Property Has Problems - Part 3

This article concludes my review with looking at the last three areas:

  8. Electrical Wiring Issues
  9. Pest Damage
10. Problems Concealed by a New Paint Job

8. Electrical Wiring Issues

Make sure electrical wiring meets modern standards.

If you have any concerns that the property’s electric wiring is dodgy or out of date, this is an area where an expert (like an electrician) should be consulted.

This should certainly be front of mind when considering buying older properties, especially those that have little evidence of renovation of modernisation.

I remember buying an old terrace house in London many years ago and without checking because I assumed it would need to be rewired. I based my assumption on the age of the property and my observations during the inspections. In the end, I was right and fortunately I had the foresight to negotiate down the purchase price based on this and other maintenance matters I had identified.

It is worth noting that wiring problems are not just confined to older properties; it is not uncommon to encounter problems in newer homes as well, especially when DIY work is involved or builders have not been as diligent as they should.

In particular, you should consider the adequacy of the electrical system when thinking about any planned near-term extensions or renovations as it is important the system can handle the multiple power demands of today’s appliances, especially in the kitchen.

Here are some common indicators that there could be problems with a property’s electrical system:

Flickering and dimming lights may mean the electrical circuit is overloaded. This usually happens when multiple devices are running at once. This can be a reasonably common occurrence, however with a well-wired property this should not be noticeable or frequent.


Discoloured or charred light switches and power points are a possible sign of faulty wiring. This occurs when wiring to the switch and power point temporarily shorts, causing a small short-lived fire which in turn causes surface damage.


This is potentially dangerous and should be fixed immediately to avoid injury. You should be able to identify these problems through a close visual inspection. If you do notice signs of damage, it is probably wise to leave the affected switches and power points alone.

A buzzing sound when switches are turned on is also a strong indicator of wiring problems, so keep your ears open when doing your testing.

During your testing, a burning smell is a sure sign something is wrong and you should immediately turn off the light or switch you’ve turned on. This smell could be a precursor to an electrical fire.

In normal circumstances, it would be prudent to turn off the circuit breaker supporting that outlet until an electrician can come and repair the problem. Since you don’t own this property, this is not something you are responsible for. It is best that you let the selling agent or vendor know what you have discovered.

Another obvious sign that that particular switch or point is damaged is if the switch/point gives you a shock when you turn it on. This may be caused by a number of factors and it is best left to an electrician to sort out.
9. Pest Damage

Look for signs of pest damage.

The first step is to liaise with the local council to learn whether a particular area or street is a designated pest zone, especially when it comes to termites.

If there are problems, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy in the affected area, it just means you should get proof that the property has been treated to protect against pest damage and that there are no current problems.

You also need to find out when and at what cost ongoing treatments will be, plus any other action you may need to take (like ensuring adequate sub-floor ventilation) so you can make an informed decision about whether you wish to proceed with buying the property.

Pests come in many forms, like rats, mice, termites, cockroaches and other bugs. Each has its own evidence of existence like faecal droppings, noise (such as scratching sounds) and signs of damage (such as gnawed furniture, shredded paper and damage to wooden structures).

You should look and listen for signs of pests at floor level, in and behind cupboards and in dark and moist areas.

When it comes to inspecting for termites, here are some steps you can take:

Gently tap exposed interior timber within reach, checking for hollow sounds and feel for imperfections like soft or spongy areas. Use a torch for timber out of reach and search for possible signs of pest activity like holes and cracks.


Inspect the outside perimeter looking for signs of pest treatments (like holes drilled in brickwork) and make sure there is adequate ventilation.


Check the garden, especially in moist areas like timber or logs, for pest activity. These will show obvious signs (like being eaten away) if termites are present.


If possible, cast a torch in the roof void and check for signs of damage to beams and struts. It is also a good opportunity to check for signs of other pests like rats if you come across rodent traps.


If you do come across signs of termite activity, do not piece or break the affected timber as this may cause the hive to migrate back to the nest or other areas of the property, and this could inhibit the effectiveness of any treatment plans.

If there are any signs of possible pest infestations, or if you have any concerns, make sure you get an independent pest inspection done. A treatment plan should include initial and ongoing costs and timeframes.

10. Problems Concealed by a New Paint Job 

Many sellers dress up their property when putting it on market in order to make it more appealing and enhance its price.

Typically, a new lick of paint will be used as a cost-effective way to brighten up and help modernise a property. However, this may also be used to hide problems.

Examples can include covering up newly repaired cracks in walls and ceilings, as well as moisture and mould damage or surface undulations and imperfections.

To alleviate any concerns, you could consider making a polite enquiry as to whether the property has had a paint job and why, as well as running your hands over newly painted areas to reveal any obvious physical problems – like soft wood or saggy or springy walls.

As a closing thought, it is important you conduct a property inspection with an open and inquiring mind. Arm yourself with a checklist of potential problem areas, which, when satisfied, will help ensure that your decision to proceed or walk away is based on an objective and informed view.

Remember, always bring in the experts if you have any major concerns as it is far better to pay a few hundred dollars now than many thousands of dollars down the track.

"Macquarie Bank today released that Australian house prices may fall as much as 7.5% over the next two years.

Before we go any further, Onthehouse.com.au figures tell us Australian house values increased approximately 14.77% over the last two years, from $440,000 in August 2013 to $505,000 in August 2015. Relative to this increase, 7.5% is not so high. In fact 7.5% is not even classified as a correction - in finance a correction is 10%.

In any case, this national figure is a misleading indicator of house price movements because there is so much discrepancy between the different housing markets across Australia. In the last two years, Sydney house values have increased by approximately 40%, while Perth houses fell by 0.56%.

Related Article: Sydney House Market Surges, Units in Decline

Analysts at Macquarie Bank have attributed the figure partly to slowed population growth estimates at an Australia wide level. It is likely Australia’s subdued GDP growth, slowed wage growth, asylum seeker deterrent policies and geographical isolation has made our country less appealing as a migration destination.

Rapid value increases in dwelling values in Sydney and Melbourne may be followed by a correction. Slowed demand from owner occupiers is expected as affordability becomes more severe and migration slows. This is supported by ABS finance data, which shows a larger amount of money being lent to housing for investment since 2014 rather than owner occupation.

It is understandable then, with the majority of demand for Australian property coming from investors, that when banks limit investor funding it will reduce investor demand and slow dwelling value growth.

Related Article: What Does a Risky Suburb Look Like?

However, declines in dwelling prices are somewhat mitigated by Australian frameworks of investment and lending, which appear to be very influential on housing supply and demand. On the demand side, every time a homeowner’s house value increases, their wealth increases because houses and units are financial assets that can be used as equity in borrowing.

By this logic, it doesn’t matter how high house prices go. In overheated markets, homeowners will always be able to keep up.

Another statistic being thrown around is the overvaluation of Australian houses. In August this year, Goldman Sachs economists estimated Sydney and Melbourne were overvalued by approximately 20%.

What is important to remember is that this figure is partly generated from rental return. However, if property values are increasing 40% over two years, it makes sense that rent probably won’t keep up as a percentage of the house price. Falling rental yields have not deterred investors – who have the ability to claim rental losses on their taxable income. It’s a win-win.

I want to emphasise that I do not believe this is a sustainable model for house price growth. However, it is wrong to characterise the current growth declines as a ‘bubble bursting’. To do so undermines the larger problems of unaffordability that will still exist, even if dwelling prices do go into correction.

"Australia’s economic trade position has been a hot topic this month, with the Chinese diplomats calling for ratification of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) and a last minute settlement on the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) with Australia and 11 other countries.

Although Australia is yet to ratify ChAFTA, and the TPP is still being negotiated within the governments of respective member countries, they set precedents for stronger economic ties and increased trade flows.

Related Article: Bad News for the Australian Economy?

But what effect do the successful negotiations of these agreements have on Australia’s housing market? It is worth noting that the ChAFTA does have provisions for easier asset acquisition. The document states that:

“Australia shall accord to investors of China treatment no less favourable than that it accords... to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.”

Where investments are:

“every kind of asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, which has the characteristics of an investment, such as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.”

Secretariat of the Foreign Investment Review Board confirmed that the agreement does not include residential dwellings, so the regulatory framework around foreign purchases of housing would remain as the status quo.

The current framework for residential real estate is as follows:

Developers are allowed to develop new dwellings in Australia and sell to domestic or foreign buyers. Foreign developers from countries such as China tend to win development contracts because they have experience with large projects and have, over many years, developed excellent economies of scale for these projects.
Individual foreign investors and visitors with a temporary residential visa can purchase new dwellings only. New dwellings refer to newly constructed houses or units that have not been lived in yet.
A foreign investor that has a temporary visa for more than 12 months (an international student for example), can purchase one established or new home with government approval. They have to live in the home while they are in Australia and sell it when they leave the country.

Given that this framework will remain unchanged under new trade agreements, it is worth considering where the agreements may have indirect impact on the housing market.

For example, increased interest in Australia’s beef and dairy exports, which are made cheaper through agreements like TPP and ChAFTA, will likely see increased export demand and foreign investment. Increased demand and investment leads to the development and expansion of agricultural sectors, which requires more workers who demand dwellings, thus driving residential development and prices.

These include areas such as Rockhampton, renowned for fine beef exports. This is aided by developing economic trading partners becoming more consumer orientated and demanding fine food exports.

Secondly, increased demand for commercial real estate in certain areas may make residential housing more expensive. Regional towns and cities that will see an influx of demand from the trade agreements can expect dwelling prices to increase as less land is designated to residential dwellings in favour of new offices, warehouses and production plants.

Commercial real estate investment opportunities are likely to become more competitive compared with residential investments once the trade agreements are implemented. Furthermore, commercial real estate presents a more sound investment currently than declining sectors such as mining.

Chinese investment in Australian commercial real estate increased by over 300% between 2012 and 2013, and at 2014 46% of foreign direct investment received by Australia from China was in commercial real estate. However, price increases in real estate may be offset by increased employment and wage growth opportunities. The extent of economic benefit and employment from these emerging trade opportunities is unclear as Australia already has bilateral FTAs with eight of the 11 other nations that signed the TPP.

However, clear winners defined by Australia’s competitive advantage, such as service providers, educational institutions and certain agricultural producers will likely see an increased demand, employment opportunities, and subsequent increased dwelling demand.

"Buying at a discount in the current cycle may sound like wishful thinking. After all, who in their right mind would sell property at a discount when they know the market is hotting up, right?

The short answer is no one.

“The reality is, no one wants to sell under market value in any market,” says Cameron Patterson, founder of InReach Investments.

“They only do so because they have to. Your job as a buyer is to identify those distressed sellers.”

The trick is to seek out these desperate vendors. However, it’s not always as easy as it sounds. In most cases, the reasons for selling are not advertised. If it is, it’s generally to drive prices up. This is because everyone is thinking they’re getting a bargain.

A distressed vendor may be a developer who has run into financial difficulty or a homeowner who has lost their job. It could be an owner who’s moving into aged care and needs to sell to pay for their bills. It could be a deceased estate and the next of kin doesn’t care what the property sells for, they just want to get rid of it. It could also be a divorce settlement.

Insider Tips for Buying Discounted Properties

It may take a bit of legwork, but it’s still possible to find these properties on your own. Here are some of the proven strategies that experts use when finding discounted properties.

1. Look for suburbs with the biggest drops in value over 3-5 years.

Todd Hunter, founder and director with wHeregroup, a buyers agency, says the quickest way to identify areas ripe for the picking is to look at how they’ve performed during the past 3-5 years.

“I look for areas that have fallen in value during the past three years or so,” says Hunter. “I also check if there are a lot of stocks that have been sitting around but already starting to move. This is a good sign that the area is turning. Don’t be afraid of negative growth. Negative values scare people, and rightly so. There is a chance that values could fall further. That’s when you do your due diligence and look for other signs that demand is returning in the area. At this point, vendors are more willing to negotiate.”

2. Establish the true value of the property you’re about to buy.

If you’re actively pursuing discounted properties, make sure you’re buying genuine undervalued properties.

There could be a big reason for the property to be highly discounted. The question you need to ask yourself is why is it undervalued or highly discounted? If it’s such a good deal, why is it that no one has found it yet?

There could be something fundamentally wrong with the property such as its location being close to a major highway or train lines.

It’s important that you understand the true value of what you’re buying, however, as not all distressed sales are good buys.

3. Identify capital growth triggers.

Unless there’s something else going for the property like capital growth potential or renovation potential, there could be little further profit to be made with that discounted property you’re about to buy.

“Capital growth is king,” says Patterson. “While there’s no guarantee that you’ll get the projected capital growth, if you buy in a location with good fundamentals and pick a sound property, you’ll significantly reduce your risk associated with buying discounted properties.”

This means ensuring that there’s a strong cash flow, low vacancy rate and infrastructure going into the area. Patterson insists on properties that are close to public transport and amenities, and areas with a low proportion of investors in relation to homeowners.

“I also look at trends such as population growth and vacancy rates in the suburb,” adds Patterson. “Look for areas with proven records of capital growth and sustainability, such as those with inner-city period homes or new developments close to the CBD. These, historically, have patterns of strong capital growth.”

4. Check the level of supply and demand.

One reason a property is selling at a discount could be the fact that it’s in an area heading towards oversupply at a time when demand starts falling.

Developers tend to overbuild in an area that has been forecast to experience strong population growth and ignore supply. They often build in a location with loads of infrastructure projects going in without considering if there are already enough properties available for sale. If the developer is having trouble selling, they’ll get desperate. Looking for locations with a large percentage of stock on market (SOM%) will uncover these problem areas.

5. Submit multiple offers.

The only way to snag a property under market value is submitting multiple offers, according to Patterson.

“Firstly, I will establish the true value and then I put in a low ball offer. I will repeat that process multiple times. Eventually, you will find an interested seller,” he says.

“Most of the leads come from my contacts in the industry. I get offered properties that don’t even go to market. I don’t necessarily get them under market value, but it gives me the chance to put in the first offer, which is a low ball offer. If the vendor is desperate, they will accept it. Mortgagee listing companies can help as well.”

6. Crunch your numbers and monitor them throughout the process.

You have to be confident with your numbers when buying any property, but even more so when buying distressed or discounted properties, says Patterson.

“If the numbers don’t stack up, be prepared to walk away. There are always going to be opportunities out there; it’s really just a matter of finding one with the right balance. You have to assess the deal holistically to make sure that the acquisition will help you move closer to your goals. Make sure that the numbers stack up. It’s always better to reject a deal and wait for the next one rather than go ahead when you’re not sure the numbers are stacking up. You’ll end up regretting it over the long run,” he says.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will hold the cash rate at 2% for October.

Underperformance in the Australian economy has led to this decision, with further rate cuts anticipated by the end of 2016.

Modelling by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revealed commodity exporters could experience a 1 percentage point decline in GDP growth from the average rate of growth over 2012 to 2014.

The decline in commodity demand is attributed to slowed growth from developing economies and increased supply in the market.

Iron ore averaged AUD$76 per unit in August, a rebound of 9.32% from AUD$69 in July. Australian thermal coal declined marginally, averaging AUD$85 per unit over August. Despite recent stability, commodity prices have been trending down since 2011 and they are not expected to increase significantly over the next 12 months.

Based on the IMF estimate, Australia’s average annualised GDP growth could slump to 1.8% over 2015 to 2017. The low growth forecast necessitates ease of borrowing to stimulate business activity.

Related Article: Bad News for the Australian Economy?

Bearish activity toward the Australian economy is reinforced by dismal stock market performance, with the ASX200 indicator falling to a three year low at the end of September. The index performance can be seen in the graph below.

The AUD traded at $0.70 USD at the start of October, but the low dollar has created benefits. At July this year, the trade balance was –A$2,460, up from its record low in April of –A$3,912.

The latest unemployment rate figure remained high at 6.2%, however job vacancies rose 7.6% in the quarter to August, suggesting potential improvement in the labour force. This was largely a result of higher demand in the services sector through the low AUD. These bright spots in the economy have offset the need for immediate reduction in the cash rate.

The cash rate decision has little direct implication for the housing market, particularly as increased risk of default in some dwelling markets has led to tighter lending.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s (APRA) instruction to banks to keep investor home loan growth below 10% a year, and National Australia Bank’s (NAB) decision to increase Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) caps on some home loans, are examples of cooling policies that complement the RBA’s cash rate decisions. It enables the RBA to stimulate lending without overheating speculative markets.

In spite of expected seasonal spikes during the spring time, and a low cash rate, Australian housing markets could see a slowdown as a result of lending restrictions. This will be a relief to those in Sydney and Melbourne, where median house values increased to $1,037,000 and $700,000 in August respectively.

Slowed growth in the Australian economy may have a long term dampening effect on the housing market. As employment opportunities slow, tax revenue for new infrastructure projects are also reduced. A low cash rate has limited scope to increase economic growth. Fiscal and lending innovations are also necessary to increase strength and diversity in the Australian economy.

"National Australia Bank has released a list of suburbs where it identifies higher risk of loan default on dwellings. As a result, the lender has announced limits to the amount of money it will loan to home buyers as a percentage of what the dwelling is worth. This is known as putting a cap on the loan to value ratio (LVR).

The highest risk suburbs identified, classified by NAB as ‘Group A’, will have a LVR cap of 70%. Of the 91 suburbs identified in this group, 58 suburbs were in Western Australia while 20 were in Queensland. The rest were spread across Tasmania (9), South Australia (3) and the Northern Territory (1).

Many of the suburbs in this high risk group – such as Boddington (WA), Emerald (QLD) and Olympic Dam (SA) – are actually mining towns. It is unsurprising to see these towns on the list.

Suburbs such as these, where employment is largely reliant on one sector, are subject to higher risk from global economic shocks. It is the local economy equivalent of putting all your eggs in one basket and then sending that basket down some white water rapids.

Related Article: Bad News for the Australian Economy?

Take Boddington as an example. According to Mining Australia, the main commodities extracted from Boddington Mine are gold and copper. At February 2011, the copper price averaged US $8,823 per dry metric tonne and gold averaged US $1,568 per troy ounce. ABS Census data showed at this time that 36.8% of the working population in this suburb were directly employed in metal ore mining. A further 10.9% were employed in the related sectors of land development and preparation, and engineering construction. That’s approximately half of the Boddington workforce who live in the suburb employed in mining projects.

In September this year, copper averaged just US $5,718 – a fall of 35%. Gold has since fallen 25% in the same period.

So, what does the risk in Boddington property look like? Graph 1 shows the boom and the bust of the house and unit markets in this town.

Graph 1: Boddington Dwellings – Annualised Capital Growth, 1995-2015

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

The Graph displays the annual rate of growth in houses and units at every month between 1995 and 2015.

The highest annual growth rate was 54% in houses, in the year to October 2006. In this year, house values increased from $214,000 to $331,000.

Fast forward to 2013 when the mining construction boom began to wind down. Unemployment in the region increased and it became more difficult for once wealthy workers and investors to repay loans that were taken out at the peak of the boom.

Slowdown in the growth rate of China’s GDP has greatly exacerbated the situation. China demands approximately 50% of Australia’s metal ore exports. Couple with a drop in metal ore prices and it is no wonder the banks are nervous.

Suburbs classified as ‘Group B’, which have slightly lower risk than ‘Group A’ suburbs, will have a LVR cap of 80%. In other words, the bank will not provide more than 80% of what the house or unit is selling for.

What has many people spooked is that a high majority of the 90 suburbs identified in ‘Group B’ are in New South Wales. Unlike the mining towns in Group A, Group B saw more diverse employment areas such as most of the major capital city CBD’s and metropolitan suburbs including Glebe, Chatswood and Darlington.

Among the risky factors of a record low cash rate, record high dwelling commencement figures and home loans for investors outstripping owner occupiers, employment diversity tends to be overlooked when characterising risky dwelling investment.

In fact, many heralded the real estate boom as absorbing unemployment from the mining sector. In 2014, approximately 14% of GDP was made up of just the buying and selling of real estate. However, the safe suburbs are likely to be ones where residents can sustain their mortgages once the market moves into down swing, and developers stop building.

"In the midst of the largest housing boom on record, capital growth in the Sydney market continues to surge.

Sydney houses recorded its highest annual growth rate (21.65%) in the current housing boom in August, bringing the median value up to $1,037,000. This is a dollar value increase of $184,500.

Meanwhile, the Sydney unit market has suffered its first decline in value since February last year in the month of August, recording a decline of 0.62%. However, despite this backward movement, annual growth in this market was 14.33% - which is by far the largest value increase across all major unit markets in Australia.

While the east coast property markets are performing counter-cyclically, the resource state capitals of Perth and Darwin continue to suffer further losses. This is a result of Australia’s main economic indicators trending unfavourably and confidence in the economy falling.

Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth is down to 2%, unemployment is above its 10 year average and currently sitting at 6.2%, and wage growth is at a historically low rate of 2.3%.

Commodity prices are also down, with iron ore trading at an average of AUD$76 per unit over August. The price of crude oil fell in 14.5% in August, to AUD$64.43. Thermal coal fell marginally from July to August, to AUD$85.26.

Table 1 presents the statistical summary of the major markets for the period ending August.

Table 1: August Summary

Things to note from the table:

Perth and Darwin dwellings suffered further declines in the quarter to August, however value reductions were not as significant as that which occurred in the quarter to July.
Sydney houses increased by $76,000 (7.88%) in the last quarter alone.
The median Melbourne house also experienced a healthy increase in value in the August quarter, with 3.13% growth bringing the median value up to $700,000.
Brisbane houses and units experienced steady growth over the year to August. Houses did particularly well, recording annual growth of 6.78% - an expected outcome as cyclical movements in Brisbane historically follow movements in the Sydney and Melbourne markets.

The future of Australian real estate seems uncertain. Recent, weak economic performance is impacting confidence in the Australian economy.

Ivan Colhoun, Chief Economist for National Australia Bank, recently reported that international clients in Europe and the Middle East have turned bearish on Australia.

A lack of economic diversity puts the Australian economy at further risk. Since 2013, the media heralded the housing market as offsetting some unemployment and economic downturn from the decline of the mining boom (you may remember the mining boom as the sector we were dependent on before real estate).

Related Article: What Does a Risky Suburb Look Like?

Professor Hans Hendrischke from the University of Sydney Business School estimated that the value of real estate transactions in the housing market Australia wide was $270 billion in 2014.

While Hendrischke himself admitted there were limitations to the accuracy of this figure (which was calculated using ABS price and sales data), if it is taken for granted, it represents approximately 14% of GDP. Fourteen per cent! Just from buying property. Higher economic diversification would mitigate some risk, should property in Sydney and Melbourne become less appealing. Meanwhile, Perth and Darwin dwellings are still dropping in value in the wake of the declining mining boom and slowed growth from China.

Is the East Coast Housing Boom Coming to an End?

This environment of economic uncertainty has had many wondering whether the east coast markets of Sydney and Melbourne can continue growing as they have since 2013. In light of historical data and academic insight, here are my thoughts:

It is too early to tell.

Sydney units suffered a slight decline in value in the month of August, from a median of $670,000 in July to $666,000 in August. This is the first time in 18 months that Sydney units saw a reduction in value[1].

The value of Melbourne units remained virtually unchanged in August.

This could be a sign that units in Sydney and Melbourne are finally (finally!!!) beginning to slow. However, everybody needs to calm down because monthly data can be volatile. This trend will be clearer if it continues over the next quarter, especially as we move into spring, which historically yields higher capital growth rates than winter[2].

In other words, it is too early to tell whether these markets have peaked. A few weeks of low clearance rates at auction, in the context of a 2.5 year housing boom, is not going to tell us much either.

Just because the economy is underperforming, does not always mean housing will.

While a lack of confidence in the Australian economy can soften capital inflows into real estate, this is not necessarily going to be the cause of a decline in dwelling values. Australia’s GDP, employment and wage growth have been trending down since 2012, but this is yet to dampen the Sydney and Melbourne housing boom.

Economic performance does affect dwelling demand in the long term, but these signals are distorted by the system in which property transacts. Real estate operates in a unique framework of borrowing and taxation. This means that dwelling values can grow counter cyclically to the economy, even as wage growth and employment levels deteriorate.

Related Article: Bad News for the Australian Economy?

This is supported when plotting the median Sydney and Melbourne house value increases against GDP increases, as shown in Graph 1.

Graph 1

Historically, downswings don’t matter.

It is impossible to know what is going to happen in the future. However, in the past, the east coast markets have been resilient.

To demonstrate this, I have put together the HPI[3]. for houses and units in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Unlike plotting growth rates, these graphs clearly show that sustained downturns in the value of houses and units over the last 35 years have been rare.

Graph 2: East Coast Houses - HPI

Graph 3: East Coast Units - HPI

What these graphs do highlight, however, is that houses and units perform well over a long period of time. The ironic thing about speculative investment in something ‘as safe as houses’ is that the investment ends up making returns more volatile. It is likely the underlying demand for residential dwellings from job growth and economic diversity that has contributed to long term growth in these east coast markets.

"The Australian economy received three pieces of bad news recently, but this doesn’t mean that the sky is falling in:

Net foreign debt is now at $967 billion; that’s up 10% from the $871 billion deficit in March.
A sharp fall in national income has all but obliterated economic growth, delivering headline growth of just 0.2%.
The Australian dollar fell below US70c.

Judging by the media headlines – this is telling us that we are all doomed and we should sell all of our assets and hide the cash under a mattress. But Australia has a long history of adapting to adversity. Who remembers the Asian crisis in the 1990’s? The dot-com bubble? The Global Financial Crisis?

None of the crises were an economic disaster for Australia, primarily due to a balanced economy, limited debt and a flexible exchange rate.

Certainly, our debt position is not as strong as it used to be, but we still have other weapons in our armoury. However, recent data indicates that these capital inflows are being used to prop up Australia’s day-to-day consumption rather than investing in our economy. Year-on-year capital expenditure is down by 10%.

I would argue that the inherent stabilisers in our economy will see us through – even if not on a stellar trajectory. Australia is not a one-trick-pony. As the resources boom comes off, I would argue that other sectors will beef up, particularly those that will benefit from a weaker Australian dollar:

Agriculture
Tourism
Education

Against the US dollar, the Australian dollar is still about 18% above the low it set in 1986, when persistent large current account deficits prompted Paul Keating to declare that Australia was in danger of becoming a banana republic. On a trade-weighted basis, it is two thirds higher now than it was then.

It is 5% and 12% higher against the US dollar than it was in 1997 and 1998 respectively during the Asian financial crisis, which is 29% and 24% higher on trade weighted terms.

It is probably true that our current political leaders on both sides lack the courage to face up to the structural challenges our economy faces, but thankfully our economic fundamentals are strong enough to keep going, regardless.

In 2013, a budget standoff between President Obama and Congress led to a prolonged shutdown of the US government – yet most observers see the US economy going from strength-to-strength.

In 2011, Belgium went 589 days without a government yet things kept ticking over such that Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal are Europe’s economic concerns.

A strong argument can be made that we are living beyond our means, but that does not mean that it can’t be fixed.

"There seems to be no getting away from China’s influence on Australian financial markets, whether it be property, equities or commodities. We’ve spoken about the effect on property prices in the past, but what about the effects on the Australian equity market?

Once upon a time, the Australian equity market was heavily influenced by the action in the United States, but recently it has been at the mercy of what is happening in China. The most obvious impact is the effect on Australian resource stocks, as demand from China drives commodity prices. On a daily basis we may see a strong lead from Wall Street negated by weakness in the Chinese equity market.

As I said in my previous article, the Chinese equity market is not necessarily driven by economic forces and it is not necessarily well correlated with Chinese growth rates, but it still impacts investor perception.

Related Article: How China's Share Market Could Affect Australian Property

When I last talked about the Shanghai Composite index, it had stabilised after the 34% decline into early July, however it then plunged another 30% in just 7 days. The slide from the June peak to the late-August low was 45%. No wonder China is on everyone’s radar.

China’s impact on Australian resource stocks is well documented, but did you know that the resource stocks were in a declining trend even as the Chinese equity market boomed in the early part of this year? In fact, the major index for resource stocks – the ASX Materials index, has halved in value since its peak in 2011.

BHP Billiton, once affectionately known as ‘the big Australian’, has declined by 55%. That is just short of the 60% fall during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the 47% fall during the Asian crisis of the late 1990’s.

China does not just impact its Asian trading partners. The latest effect of China’s share market rout has been felt in the world’s largest economy, the United States. A September hike in the key U.S. interest rate was on the cards for months in the lead up to the September meeting, but when the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged in September, Chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen cited Chinese induced volatility in global financial markets as one of the reasons for keeping interest rates at a record low.

This outcome created investor uncertainty, sending the U.S. equity market on a roller coaster ride. This will flow onto the Australian market and potentially the Australian dollar.

The world is interlinked and what happens in one area will have a ripple effect, and China is causing more than a few ripples these days.

"In Part 1, we went over the first two of the 10 key problem areas identified to look out for before you buy property:

1. Water Damage
2. Uneven Floors, Walls and Ceilings

This article will focus on problem areas three and four:

3. Foundation Problems
4. Plumbing Issues

Related Article: 10 Signs a Property Has Problems - Part 1

3. Foundation Problems

Simply put, the weight of a property is transferred to the land it is built on, be it rock or soil. If this land shrinks or expands, it could cause the property’s foundation to move.

Checking for foundation problems is very important, because if there are issues – it could be very costly to repair.

Soil tends to expand when it’s wet and shrink when it’s dry. This swelling and shrinking is what can cause property foundation movement to occur, which in turn can lead to serious and expensive structural problems. Examples of the causes of these problems include poor water drainage (which keeps soil moist near the property) or the planting of trees and plants around the property’s perimeter (which can cause soil to dry out).

There are a number of signs that may indicate foundation problems, which you should look out for:

Cracks in walls and ceilings, and even window panes
Doors and windows that jam and won’t open/close properly
Uneven and sloping floors
Spaces or gaps opening up in the joins between walls and ceilings
Cracked and displaced wall and ceiling mouldings
Sloping and cracked chimneys
Walls leaning or separating from the house frame
Cracks and gaps in exterior brickwork

If you have any doubts in the property you are inspecting, you should arrange for a structural engineer’s report before you buy. Apart from identifying major problems, the report can be used as a tool in order to help negotiate the price down to cover the cost of any remedial work.

4. Plumbing Issues

We all know from experience that plumbing problems can be expensive to fix, not to mention being a possible major inconvenience, so it is important to keep an eye out for plumbing issues during your inspection.

Being able to identify potential problems, especially major ones, as early as possible and certainly before you buy is ideal. Here are some things to look out for while conducting your inspection:

Hot Water Service

Check the adequacy of the hot water service. Find out how old it is, whether it will be able to supply enough hot water for your needs and when it was last serviced.

A hot water system can be expensive to repair and even more expensive to replace if it is old or faulty. Make sure you get the evidence you need – such as testing the temperature by running hot water taps in different rooms and sight the original purchase and service invoices – to get assurance of its age, maintenance history and that everything works as it should.


Drainage

Make sure drains are working properly (to ensure there are no clogged pipes) and flush each toilet to check there is adequate water flow.


Trees

Examine the position of the trees on the property to help determine if there may be any potential or actual root damage to sewer pipes. You’ll need a map of the easements and sewer lines to identify if there’s a possible problem.

In the worst case, tree roots can crack and grow through sewer pipes causing major problems including blockages. Again, this can be costly to repair, especially if you have to unclog or replace any broken pipes. It can also be messy if the sewerage backs up and overflows into the property.


All Plumbing

It is also a good idea to check the age and general state of repair of all the plumbing works in the bathroom, kitchen and laundry (i.e. basins, taps, sinks, showers and baths).

Ideally, it would be great if these items were aesthetically pleasing but more importantly they need to be functional and in good working order. Remember, having to redo or remodel a bathroom or kitchen can cost thousands of dollars.

If you’re in any doubt about the quality or the functioning of a property’s plumbing, seek advice and assistance from an independent plumber.
In my next column we’ll take a look at how to identify possible problems with driveways and paving, renovation restrictions and limitations, and a property’s history.

"The arrival of spring signals the beginning of renewal and growth. It is also the start of the busiest time in the property market, where buyers and sellers are out in force. This is especially the case for the period between the September and Christmas, when the property market hits its peak.

As more properties come on the market, competition increases as buyers have more choice and can be more selective in what they will and won’t buy. So, to help you achieve a successful spring sale, here are my top 5 tips to help your property stand out from the crowd…

1. Focus on street appeal

First impressions mean a lot in the property market, especially the view from the street. Curb appeal can make or break a property – if there isn’t any, it can stop potential buyers from even walking through the front gate.

This is why your home has to be inviting and reflect a place that is well loved and looks in a near new condition. Make sure the front fence and gate is in good repair, the front garden is neat, tidy and free of clutter, and the front of the house is clean and in a good state of repair – apply a lick of paint if need be.

Tip: Don’t forget to move garbage bins out of sight and to clean out your gutters.

2. Be up to date with maintenance work

Make sure all the little repair jobs have been taken care of. Obvious maintenance work needs to be a priority so buyers focus on the positives, not the negatives. Things like cracked tiles, leaking taps, windows that don’t open and close properly, and blinds that don’t work are examples of defects that are usually easy and cheap to fix.

Tip: Conduct a thorough inspection of your property and make a list of all the things that need doing. Make sure you’ve made all the repairs before your first opening.

3. Showcase outdoor areas

Outdoor areas can be a big differentiating factor. Most Australians love outdoor living, so no matter how small or large your garden or patio area is, make sure potential buyers can see themselves enjoying a BBQ, family gatherings or just relaxing in a welcoming, functional and aesthetically pleasing space. Cost effective garden makeovers can also pay dividends, and you can develop wasted areas into useful secluded spaces.

Tip: Quality outdoor furniture can lift the appeal of back and front gardens and help buyers better appreciate what you property offers in the way of outdoor living.

4. Light and bright interiors

No one likes inspecting a dull, dreary or dark property, so make sure you have as much natural light flowing in as possible. Keep colour schemes and internal decoration in mind as colour plays a big part in a room’s appeal – it can make it feel bright and airy or small and confined. Keep colours as neutral as possible and make sure your furnishings and fittings reflect the taste of potential buyers. The aim is to get buyers thinking about how your property could meet their tastes and needs, not yours.

Tip: Rooms can be transformed for other purposes. For example, a spare bedroom could be turned into a study space or vice-a-versa. Think about your property’s layout and how it can be reconfigured to best meet the needs of target buyers.

5. Clean is key

It goes without saying that your property must be neat, tidy and clean. Make sure walls, tiles floorboards and carpets are clean, polished and free from stains, especially in high traffic areas such as stairs and hallways. It is also a good idea to check if curtains need dry-cleaning and blinds need a dust.
If your property requires a substantial clean, you should consider using a professional cleaning service. Replacing old and worn floor and wall coverings is also a good idea if they are beyond repair or restoration.

Tip: Freshly brewed coffee, cakes and flowers can make a property feel like a home. Having these out during inspection times can be quite inviting.

"So far we have addressed the first four of the 10 key problem areas to identify before you buy property:

1. Water Damage
2. Uneven Floors, Walls and Ceilings
3. Foundation Problems
4. Plumbing Issues

This article looks at the next three areas:

5. Driveway and Paving Problems
6. Renovation Restrictions and Limitations
7. Problems with the Property's History

Related Article: 10 Signs a Property Has Problems - Part 2

5. Driveways and Paving Problems

Driveways can help enhance a property’s curb appeal (not to mention providing access to the garage and carport), as well as doubling up as a play area for the kids where they can have game of cricket, shoot some hoops or do whatever takes their fancy. On the other hand, paved courtyards and backyards can enhance the look, appeal and enjoyment of outdoor living and entertaining.

However, driveways and outdoor paving can also be expensive to repair, especially if major work is involved. This is why it is very important to inspect them thoroughly to make sure there are no immediate or potential problems.

The main causes of damage to driveways and outdoor paving includes:

Poor workmanship


Concrete shrinkage


Movement due to settlement – resulting from similar causes explored in my third point, Foundation Problems.


Damage caused by tree roots – this is something I’ve experienced firsthand when the roots of our gum trees headed towards the surface and lifted the pavers in our driveway. This problem is more than just aesthetic – it can pose dangers resulting from tripping on exposed paver edges, which is something to be particularly mindful of with young children and older adults around. 


Excessive or heavy use – damage can occur through wear and tear if. For example, on a driveway has high usage such as a shared driveway for units/flats, or if the
weight bearing limit is exceeded by a heavy vehicle causing concrete to crack or pavers to sink.

You should be able to identify many of these problems yourself. If there are signs of damage it would be wise to get a quote from a builder or paver/landscape gardener to quantify the cost of repair.

6. Renovation Restrictions and Limitations 

Identify any future renovation restrictions and limitations.

Many of us buy a property with a view that sometime down the track you are going to renovate or develop it so that it better meets your lifestyle and personal needs, or to add value so you get a better price when it comes time to sell. Or, in the case of an investment property, you want to make it more attractive to tenants thereby generating a higher rental income.

Whatever your reasons might be, it is important to check if there are any restrictions on what can and can’t be done to the property.

In most cases, it is unlikely that there will be major restrictions although it is important to verify this by liaising with the local council to find out what is and isn’t allowable.

This is particularly important if your plans include extending the footprint of the house or unit, and/or adding additional storeys.

A good starting point is to check out other properties in the street and neighbourhood to see what other owners have done/been allowed to do and whether this aligns with your plans. However, this should only be used as an indicator – you must always check with the local council before starting any major structural renovation or incurring any builder or architect costs.

In addition, even if you can undertake the renovations you want, you need to make sure you don’t overcapitalise, spend money that might actually reduce a property’s attractiveness or discover the cost of the renovations you want are much higher than your expectations and budget (this might occur because of problems with the existing structures/foundation, land shape or property access issues).

In these cases, a visit and discussion with some local selling agents as well as initial no obligation discussions with local builders would be beneficial.

In any event, if the property doesn’t have the renovation potential you seek, either because of council restrictions, cost limitations or the likelihood you may overcapitalise for the area, then you could be better off walking away and finding a more suited property.

7. Problems with the Property’s History

The flip side to investigating whether you can renovate yourself is to look into what renovations and repairs the current owners have undertaken.

Checking out the property’s history is vital to protect yourself against illegal and dodgy work.

Some key questions to ask include:

Why were the renovations done?

Check whether there was a major problem that needed fixing or whether it was done to improve the property.


Who did the renovations?

Make sure a licenced tradesperson undertook any major works and whether any guarantees or insurances would transfer to you on sale.


Did you get council approval?

Make sure any major improvements were approved and are legal. If the renovation was done on a strata title property (like an apartment) you need to make sure it was carried out and approved in line with the strata’s rules and regulations.


Can you provide the necessary certificates/letters of authorisation?

This links to points b and c above. Here you want to see building permits, electrical certificates, product warranties, copies of insurance certificates etc.


Have there been any problems with the renovations?

This question relies heavily on the vendor’s honesty and is designed to help you avoid inheriting the vendor’s issues, such as existing or potential claims under Builders Warranty Insurance.

If it turns out that the vendor did most of the renovation work themselves, including structural changes, rewiring and plumbing, and he/she is not a licensed tradesperson, then you need to be cautious.

For instance, structural changes whereby a load bearing wall was removed and the remaining structures are not reinforced could result in structural integrity problems, while DIY electrical work can be downright dangerous.

So, if you identify potential problems with the property’s history and you are serious about buying, prepare a list of these problems and hand it to a property inspector so he/she can cast a trained eye over them and provide you with an independent report and assessment.

In my final instalment of this series, we will review the last three problem areas on my list:

"When it comes to buying a home or an investment property, it is vital that you conduct a thorough inspection before you sign on the dotted line – to ensure you don’t buy a lemon.

Just because a property looks good on the outside, it could have serious defects that may not be immediately obvious and they may end up costing you thousands of dollars to repair.

A property inspection will help you avoid blowing your budget on unexpected repairs and maintenance work, and it could also save you from the emotional strain of watching your beloved purchase turn into a disaster.

There are two main ways you can inspect a property:

1. Do it yourself – When conducting a personal inspection, it is important that you take a balanced approach. You’re looking for the downsides as well as what makes the property an attractive buy. You might also like to ask your family and/or friends to come along for an inspection too, to make sure you don’t miss anything.

2. Bring in the experts – When you’re serious about buying, you can bring the experts, such as pest inspectors etc, to help ensure your property is free from defects.

Related Article: Property Investor Survival Guide

Keeping a close eye out for problems and reflecting on what you’ve discovered will enable you to objectively decide whether or not a property is worth pursuing, or whether it is worth incurring the added expense of bringing in the experts to do further investigations. Either way, a balanced property inspection can save you time, money and effort.

In my experience over the years, I have found there are certain areas you should particularly focus on when conducting a property inspection. With this in mind, this 4 part series will detail each of the key problems identified below.

10 Key Problem Areas to Focus On

1. Water Damage
2. Uneven Floors, Walls and Ceilings
3. Foundation Problems
4. Plumbing Issues
5. Driveway and Paving Problems
6. Renovation Restrictions and Limitations
7. Problems with the Property’s History
8. Electrical Wiring Issues
9. Pest Damage
10. Problems Concealed by a New Paint Job

In this article, we will go over the first 2 potential problem areas from the list.

1. Water Damage

Look for signs of water damage.

The impact of water damage can be minor or major, depending on the cause and the duration of the problem. However, problems can be expensive to fix, especially when they effect the structural integrity of the property.

Signs of water damage can be found in many places. To start with, check out the walls and ceilings for stains and watermarks, and be on alert for damp smells, mould and mildew – especially in the kitchen, bathrooms and when opening up cupboards.

You should also inspect the property’s gutters and downpipes to make sure there is no rust, leaks or other damage, and also ensure rainwater is discharging into stormwater drains and not onto the ground or the structure of the house.

Another thing to look out for is wet ceiling insulation. This could mean there is a leak in the roof somewhere, and you’ll probably need the help of an expert (like a roofer) if you think this may be an issue.

Finally, turn on all the taps throughout the house to see how good (or bad) the water pressure is. Low water pressure may indicate there’s a leak in the plumbing.

2. Uneven Floors, Walls and Ceilings

Floors, walls and ceilings should be straight and fixed flush in place.

To check for any anomalies, start by casting your eye over surfaces to identify undulations, sags and gaps.

Another good way to find problems is to shine a torch over surfaces, especially ceilings and walls, to see if there are any shadows or deflections that shouldn’t be there.

In addition, bowed, sagging and springy wooden floors can be a sign that there may be more serious problems to deal with other than having to replace a few damaged floorboards.

If you do find problems, it could be down to a number of causes, including:

For older properties, it could simply be a symptom of age and a lack of repair and maintenance work. This would be your responsibility to repair if you decide to go through with the purchase and buy the property.
If the home is on stumps, it could be a sign that the stumps are worn, displaced or rotten (if they’re made of wood) and are not supporting the floors as they should.


It may indicate foundation settlement, meaning that the land the house/unit is built on gives way over time and is unable to adequately support the property’s weight, causing it to shift.


It could be a sign of moisture issues. Moisture may have damaged the wooden support structures of the property, causing the wood to become soft and ultimately to decay and sag.

The cost of remedying these issues will depend on the severity of the problems themselves, and can become very expensive.

In these circumstances, getting an independent structural report could pay dividends. It would identify both the extent of any damage and the cost of necessary repair work, and this alone may help you decide whether or not to proceed with purchasing the property.

Part 2 will go over how to identify foundation problems and plumbing issues.

"The momentum is gathering on policy and discussion around the abolishment of negative gearing legislation.

The Greens have recently issued a paper on their stance, and Labor is considering a proposal to limit home buyers' use of negative gearing to new properties only - in a move designed to drive the creation of new housing and deliver a $29.3 billion benefit to the budget bottom line over a decade.

The proposal is contained in a policy paper by the Labor-aligned McKell Institute, and signals a willingness to reform negative gearing if it wins the next election especially as the government is under pressure over property prices.

Given the overall magnitude of negative gearing – in 2010/11 there were 1.2 million individuals with negatively geared properties – a shift in tax incentives towards new construction has the potential to have a material impact on housing supply.

We do not know what the future holds for negative gearing, however it would be in every property investor’s interest to understand what each political party is proposing. All investors have made decisions based on the tax benefits of negative gearing, and without these benefits investors may be placed in a financial position that forces them to sell or increase rents to cover costs.

Related Article: 7 Steps to Buying an Investment Property

Here is a summary of current proposals to remove negative gearing:

The Greens

The Greens model is limiting the change to asset purchases after a particular date, which basically means grandfathering and allowing negative gearing to continue on any existing investment properties held. This will mean existing investors will not be impacted – which, in my opinion, would be a fairer model.

Economists

Some economists advising the government are proposing a phasing out of negative gearing over five years or more, and it would apply regardless of when the property was purchased. For example, in the first year, all investors could claim 85% of losses, then 70% in the second year with further reductions in following years until claims reached zero. It is suggested that it is far better to phase the removal of negative gearing in, which means you treat all generations the same and avoid a potential freezing up of the housing investment market. This proposal has some legs.

Labour Party

Labor have talked about ending negative gearing as it stands while grandfathering existing properties, similar to The Greens' proposal. However, Labor are also proposing to allow new participants to negatively gear up to $1 million of property, but only on new housing construction whilst grandfathering existing arrangements. They believe this will create stimulus for new housing stock. This has created more interest amongst the back benchers, according to media reports.

Liberal Party

The Liberals stance is that the abolishment of negative gearing could see substantial increases in rents as landlords will need to offset to allow them to receive the benefits that they were getting with negative gearing. They believe Australian’s have invested to give themselves and their children some financial security. Joe Hockey has publicly stated negative gearing is not on the agenda, however with budgetary pressures anything is possible.

As an independent observer, to me, it appears that there will be changes made in negative gearing policy in the years to come. To what extent, I am not sure, however the most popular and politically safe line of thought is that existing property investors will not be impacted by changes on properties they already own as the changes in legislation will be grandfathered. This may also see a short term spike in property values as investors try to get in on the act over the coming years before any changes are made.

Whether the tinkering with this legislation is a good or bad thing for the economy is a discussion for another day.

"Commodities are a really interesting predictive tool. Research exists showing that current commodity prices can indicate future movements in anything from GDP growth, to something as specific as student enrolments in engineering courses.

It makes sense then that commodities exported from Australia could provide insight into housing market movements. The relationship might be particularly distinct in the resource-oriented markets of Perth and Darwin.

Related Article: Sydney Median Passes $1 Million While Resource States Contract Further

In Graph 1, changes in iron ore export values are plotted against annualised capital growth in Perth and Darwin’s house and unit markets.

Graph 1: Change in Iron Ore Export Values vs. Capital Growth in Resource Dwellings

At first glance, it almost looks as if the two factors have an inverse relationship. However, it is more likely to be a lead lag effect. This means that when higher volumes of iron ore is demanded, it takes a while for the benefits of this to flow into the housing market.

A number of commodity prices have tumbled in the last year. The iron ore price averaged just AUD $69 per dry metric tonne over the month of July, which is a 13.88% reduction from the previous month.

Australian Thermal Coal remained steady over the last month, averaging AUD $85.75 per pound. However, this is a significant reduction from the peak price in 2008 when coal averaged over AUD $200.

World Bank data shows that resources boomed in the early 2000’s, following a long period of low valuation between the 1970’s and the 1990’s. While it appears that commodities are in a correction period, values have not fallen so drastically that prices are below what they were a decade ago.

In response to the decline in commodity prices, many suppliers, including BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, chose to increase efficiency and cost cutting as opposed to reducing supply. This is likely due to larger producers taking advantage of the fall in commodity values to pressure smaller suppliers out of the market.

In line with cost cutting, thousands of mining positions have been terminated across South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This, coupled with the completion of mining construction projects, is exacerbating economic downturn in the resource states.

Deterioration may be slightly offset in the short term due to the devaluation of the Yuan, which will make Chinese steel exports more competitive and drive demand for Australian Iron Ore, an input in steel production.

Related Article: How China's Share Market Could Affect Australian Property

As commodity prices stabilise at significantly lower levels, the Darwin and Perth dwelling markets could also be on a bumpy road towards stabilisation at a lower level. These markets were the worst performing capital city markets in the year to July, with Darwin unit values declining a significant 6.41% while Perth house values contracted 4.34%.

However, as with commodity values, long term price stability may not be as dire as many make it out to be.

To put the current growth cycle in perspective, the historical House Price Index (HPI)[1] data for Perth and Darwin is presented in Graphs 2 and 3.

Graph 2: Perth HPI

Graph 3: Darwin HPI

The graphs show that, like commodity values, dwellings in the resource capitals are no longer in a stage of rapid growth as they were between 2000 and 2008.

The Perth and Darwin markets are currently in a correction period, which is indicated by the downward movement of the HPI. However, putting the dwelling positions into a larger historical context shows they have not drastically collapsed.

During the mining boom, the Perth market saw annualised growth rates as high as 40 per cent in 2006. However, these growth rates were met with corrections of 10 per cent in 2009. The end of the mining boom has restored growth cycles that are much more subdued than these levels.

[1] The HPI, or House Price Index, is a number that indicates how much a median property value has grown since the first data point of measurement.

"The most basic economic law of supply and demand may not apply to real estate, according to Professor Laurence Murphy from the University of Auckland.

At Sydney University’s Festival of Urbanism, Murphy demonstrated that rapid price increases can occur in spite of high levels of dwelling supply.

In reaction to the research, proud economists everywhere are having an existential crisis.

One of the first things you are taught in economics is that the more of a good you supply, the less competition exists for a particular unit of that good, and so its price should come down. It is the reason rare items (like gold) are so expensive, or plentiful items (like university graduates) are so cheap.

So why is it then, in spite of record dwelling approval and commencement figures in New South Wales, do values continue to rise so rapidly?

Murphy points out that the real world is more complex than economics 101 would have you believe. Housing is different to products that more closely resemble a basic supply and demand model, partly because of the institutional forces that influence finance and development.

Housing has the ability to perform counter cyclically (to increase even as other economic indicators start moving down) because individuals are able to borrow more against housing relative to other asset forms.

This counter cyclical performance is particularly apparent in the Sydney housing market (see Graph 1).

Graph 1: Counter Cyclical Performance of Sydney Property

Source: ABS and Onthehouse.com.au

Despite nation-wide conditions of low wage growth (2.3%), high official unemployment (6.3%) and low GDP growth, Sydney house values increased 21% in the year to July.

Murphy illustrated the unique operation of property using the case of Ireland, where house prices have, in the past, continued to increase with supply. If only we had the data to examine the Australian situation.

Oh wait – we’re Onthehouse.com.au – of course we do.

Graph 2 shows median house values in NSW over time, over ABS residential dwelling construction data.

Graph 2: Construction of Dwellings vs. Median House Value (NSW)

Source: ABS Dwelling Construction Data (Catalogue No. 8752.0) and Onthehouse.com.au

From 2013 onwards, it is especially clear that record levels of construction seems to have no effect on the slope of the median value line, which indicates a very high rate of growth.

Murphy’s reasoning for the fact that house values increase with supply were put simply, but are powerful.

He analysed the economic behaviour of developers, which partly explained the phenomenon. It would not make sense for profit-seeking developers to produce houses in order to make them cheaper. Developers use the rate of house price increases to guide their supply decision. Therefore supply is being driven by prices going up.

The ability to borrow, coupled with tax concessions that make housing an attractive way to build wealth, encourage people to purchase houses as their income goes up. In other words, the elasticity of demand for housing is very high. This means that increasing housing supply is not an effective way to achieve lower house prices.

In fact, Murphy collated research from economists who found from forecasting models that supplying a large amount of property every year would, in the long term, only very marginally improve affordability. Further to this, he emphasised that attempting to achieve high levels of supply would drain resources from other parts of the economy into a sector that has relatively low productivity.

This suggests that demand side policy could be more effective than increasing supply. Supply is relatively inelastic to demand because it takes a lot of time and money to build houses. However, addressing demand is not as simple as vilifying investors. To do so ignores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to restoring housing affordability.

For example, one might consider the implications of superannuation and pension reform on motivations of investors to purchase property. A holistic approach to addressing demand side factors could present a much more effective solution to deteriorating affordability in Sydney.

"The RBA announced it will hold the cash rate at 2% at its September Board Meeting.

Maintaining the low cash rate is likely intended to stimulate the Australian economy against waning indicator movements and the Chinese stock market crash. However, using the cash rate to stimulate the Australian economy is, at this point, like trying to use a hammer to build a ship in a glass bottle; it’s blunt, inappropriate and makes onlookers nervous.

China is an enormous trading partner with Australia – 35% of the value of all merchandise exports demanded from Australia in June this year came from China. This makes Australian prosperity heavily dependent on Chinese performance, particularly in Western Australia and the Northern Territory where resource exports to China make up an even larger portion of export value.

Related Article: How China's Share Market Could Affect Australian Property

Maintaining a low cash rate could make it easier for Australian exporters to borrow and innovate in an uncertain global market, and potentially stimulate domestic consumption.

Export demand may be aided by a persistently low AUD, which fell to US$0.70 at the end of August. Depreciation in the dollar mitigates the need for a further cash rate cut this month.

However, as well as slowing export demand from China, the stock market crash has led to falling confidence from domestic investors, causing domestic private investment to fall. This may incentivise a rate cut later this year.

The NAB Monthly Business Survey saw the business confidence indicator fall significantly in July, from +8 in June to +4 in July, suggesting a decrease in confidence in the levels of trading, profitability and employment.

Tomorrow, economists will keep their eyes peeled for the June quarter national account figures to be released by the ABS, which will reveal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Annualised GDP growth is expected to fall to 2.2% from 2.3% in the March quarter, which is well below the 10 year average of 3.2%.

The unemployment rate was up to 6.3% in July, from 6.1% in the previous month. The participation rate increased by 0.3 percentage points in the same period. Wage growth was last measured in March at 2.3% for the quarter, which is a record low.

While the businesses confidence, investment and wage growth are low in the wake of the volatile Chinese stock market, it is important to keep some perspective on the Chinese economy. Despite slowed growth rates in Chinese GDP, the economy is worth approximately US$10.4 trillion. It is second in size to only the US economy, and it is approximately 10 times larger than the Australian economy. To grow continually at 7 to 8% per annum would defy the law of large numbers.

Furthermore, the stock market does not represent all of China’s economic activity. Relative to other nations, stock equities represent a small portion of household wealth. This is not to say that China, and subsequently Australia, will experience a painless economic recovery.

The Australian dwelling market in July presented even more disparate growth than the previous month. For example, annualised growth saw a contraction in Perth houses of 4.34%, while Sydney houses surged by 21.17%, showing a real dollar value increase of approximately $180,000 in a single year.

A low cash rate, and talk of a further 25 basis point cut in November, puts the Sydney market position at further risk. Interest rates are likely to remain low for some time in the context of global economic uncertainty. A low cash rate is not a sign of economic strength, and yet housing finance commitments to investors continues to outstrip owner occupiers, suggesting a majority of those purchasing dwellings are employing a wealth growing strategy.

"Like other asset classes, investing in property carries some risks. During an economic downturn, they can be significantly magnified. Therefore, it’s important to put a strategy in place that deals with risks when they occur.

Here are a few tips on what to do when confronted by the following investment challenges.

1. Your property loses value

If you find yourself in a position where the value of your property is falling, you need to determine whether you would be better off cutting your losses and selling now, or holding the property on the basis that prices will increase in the future.

Despite the increased investor activity in the market, rents are still rising in many parts of Australia.

That means that as time goes on, your property is costing you less (in terms of cash flow) to maintain. Add the lower interest rates and all of a sudden, many property investors are finding themselves holding positive cash flow investment properties.

Even if you have negative equity, if the property is costing you nothing to hold, it’s likely you’re better off holding on to it, rather than selling in a depressed market.

It’s costly to buy and sell rapidly as stamp duty, loan costs and agents fees quickly eat into your profits.

The other thing to consider is that you haven’t really lost anything until you actually sell.

2. You lose your job

Losing your job will have an immediate impact upon your ability to borrow and begin – or continue – to build your property portfolio.

Curiously, this is not usually because you can no longer afford your investment loans – if you have owned a property for some time, it’s likely that the rents have increased and the property is most likely looking after itself and paying its own costs.

Rather, it’s because you may no longer be able to afford your own loans and personal expenses, and if your property was to become vacant, the risk that you are unable to remain financially solvent becomes greater.

If you lose your job, you need to notify your lender immediately. A good place to start is to find out if you can take a repayment holiday from your current loans; if you’ve been making any additional repayments, it is likely that your loan is in advance and a few months off may be allowed.

If you have investment or interest-only loans, find out if you can capitalise the interest for a few months, too – that way the cash flow from your property can assist you to manage your daily personal expenses.

At times like these, a line of credit loan can also be useful. You can create a ‘buffer’ of extra funds that are not needed for the property purchase, but which you can draw-back for expenses or capital purchases, or to use during those times when cash flow is tight.

If you become unemployed, you won’t be able to switch to a loan like this, so you must put it in place beforehand, and then use it wisely in the meantime.

Don’t be tempted to use the additional funds for holidays or buying a new car. Instead, try to make extra repayments and save the buffer that you have for that rainy day – like losing your job.

Losing your job will likely put a stop to investing in the short term, so take this time to be patient, sit on what you have already accrued, and wait until you are once again employed before trying to add to your portfolio.

3. The news is consistently gloomy

Persistent negative sentiment in the marketplace is actually to your advantage.

Warren Buffet, the billionaire, once said that, “most people get interested in investing when everyone else is buying – but the time to get interested is when no one else is”.

The past 10 years have provided such a period of good fortune for most Australians that pretty much anything you bought as an investment did well.

This made some investors forget about the basics, especially where property is concerned – the basics being that the importance is not about market timing, but about time in the market.

The doom and gloom at the moment is suggesting that property prices are about to experience a spectacular fall.

However, bread and butter property in lower priced areas will in many ways survive the storm and retain, and even grow, their values.

It all comes down to your investment strategy – if you’re in it for short-term gains, you will likely be nervous at the moment. But if you’re in it for the long term you will be looking for opportunities in the market, and won’t be dissuaded by the current negative sentiment.

4. You can’t get finance

When you borrow money, you must satisfy two types of eligibility criteria; the first one is serviceability; and the second is equity.

Serviceability relates to your capacity to service the new loan. Often, a borrower will approach a bank for more money before they actually find a property. In this case your lender might not be taking into account the additional income that the property will produce in terms of rent, ‘since the amount has not been established yet’.

A lender will generally accept up to 80% of any rent received, as long as it can be proven that the rent will exist. So someone previously rejected for a loan may find that, once they find that new property, they now qualify.

If you haven’t yet found the right property, but you know the general suburb you wish to invest in, try approaching a real estate agent for a general indication of rents in the area.

If they can provide you with a letter estimating the average rental return in the area, you can pass this onto your lender, so they can take this additional income into consideration when processing your application.

But beware that each bank has different serviceability criteria – one lender may allow you to commit $1 to loan repayments for every $1 that you generate in rental income, while another may just take 80 cents for each $1.

For this reason, it’s crucial that you get an opinion from several lenders as to the amount they are prepared to advance to you.

Equity criteria relates to the value of the security or property that you are able to offer. To borrow without paying lenders mortgage insurance, you will need to have at least 20% deposit or equity in each security you have.

The difficulty arises here once the valuations are performed – you may believe you have the equity, but a valuer may disagree and place a valuation on your property that is lower than you expect.

You can question this and ask for another valuation, but only if you have evidence that an equivalent property near your property recently sold for more than the valuation you received.

If your valuation comes up short, you can borrow more than 80% of the value of the property as some lenders are offering up to 95% loan to value ratio. However, you need to be aware that this will significantly increase your risk due to higher repayments as well as the hefty upfront cost of lenders mortgage insurance.

5. You have tenant troubles

As Australia’s economy weakens further, the issue of financial uncertainty is now at the forefront of most people’s minds.

The good news is that with proper preparation, you can avoid just about any situation that could result in you losing your rental income.

Having the right insurance in place is the first level of protection against financial loss. Landlord insurance is specifically designed for property investors to protect themselves from loss of rent, which is usually caused by either:

Tenants who have caused you to lose income by damaging your property, leaving without paying rent, or worse – they stay on but stop paying rent.
Some sort of act of nature or freak accident causes so much damage to your property that your tenants have to move out.

If you have landlord insurance, it is important to be aware of what the policy protects you against, and the excess that would be applicable in the event of a claim. A good landlord insurance policy should protect you against:

Loss of rent (for default of rent by tenant) Up to 15 weeks
Content insurance (malicious and accidental damage) $50,000
Building (malicious and accidental damage) $50,000
Landlord’s legal liability $20,000,000

Standard building insurance offers the best protection against freak accidents and acts of nature, like severe storms or fire.

"Buying an investment property may seem daunting if you haven’t gone through the process before. You’ll find yourself asking – What do I do? Where do I start? Who do I speak to? What is the sequence of events? 

In order to assist you through this important process, I have put together 7 steps for you to use as a checklist when purchasing a property.

1. Determine what you can afford

You have to be able to afford the cash flow impact on owning an investment property, so reviewing your finances and budget is a good place to start. Work out how much disposable income you have after each pay packet, taking into consideration your daily living costs, and make sure you do not overcommit. Work out how much you have saved that can go towards your deposit, or how much extra savings you will need for this. Generally, to avoid additional costs such as lenders mortgage insurance, a 20% deposit is required. Also allow for 5% of the purchase price to cover costs like stamp duty and legal fees.

A very important thing that is often overlooked is being able to handle the emotional side of property ownership. Yes, there may be times when the market drops or is stagnate so you might get little or no capital growth, and yes you may have problems with tenants and vacancy periods, but this is part and parcel of what property investing is, so make sure you are emotionally prepared for what might come your way – after all, it is generally a long term investment!

2. Find out how much you can borrow

Contact a lender or broker to determine how much you can borrow. Get pre-approval for the loan and understand your monthly payments and interest rates, both fixed vs variable.
Once you have worked through step 1, you should contact a lender or broker to find out how much you can borrow based on your income, financial commitments and deposit, and at what interest rate you can take out a loan. . Get pre-approval for the loan and understand your monthly payments and interest rates, both fixed vs variable, then you can begin searching for property with certainty based on how much you can spend. Knowing what you can afford and what your budget is will dictate where you can purchase and what type of property you can buy – for example, a house or apartment, new or old.

You should also consider how you will structure your loan – does interest only or principle and interest work best for you? Should you lock in rates for a fixed term, leave it at the variable or go half/half? The answers to these questions may depend on the economic environment at the time and as always, seek counsel from the professionals before making a commitment!

3. Get advice from an accountant

You should seek advice from an accountant on what the best name to purchase the property in is, as this could significantly impact on tax benefits. Having the correct name also takes into account potential asset protection issues, land tax issues and stamp duties. An accountant can also explain how negative gearing works, as well as depreciation, especially with newer buildings. This is advice the banks won’t give you, and this may impact your decision on what you buy and how much you can afford to spend on a property.

An accountant will give you a second opinion on how much you can afford each week and the tax impact on this amount. Once armed with this information and your loan pre-approval, you are now ready to take the next step of purchasing a property.

4. Contact a lawyer

Contact a lawyer that specialises in property in advance to assist with conveyancing, searches and settlement. Ensure they know what name is to go on the contract after confirming with your accountant. Once you have found the right property and have instructed them to review the contract, also inform them whose name should appear on the contract. This is very important – so make sure you seek advice from your accountant before deciding the name that will go on the contract of sale. While undertaking the review of your contract, you may also want to make sure that your Will is current and reflects the latest changes and commitments, or, if you don’t have a Will, arrange for one to be drawn up.

5. Conduct thorough property research

This is a critical step. If you don’t do thorough research, you could end up paying too much for a property or investing in a location that doesn’t meet your investment goals, which could end up costing you a lot of money. Do your own research for areas with good growth potential, good rental yields and good rental demand. Look at the demographic of the suburb and things like proximity to public transport, schools, roads and shops. Remember, other than your own home (if you are an owner-occupier), this will be your largest investment decision so do your homework and seek professional help if required.

Also ensure you understand the sales processes of making an offer on a property or what happens at an auction. Don’t become emotionally attached to a property – it’s an investment, a business decision – you are only interested in maximising capital growth and rental returns.

After discussions with your accountant you would have determined whether you should look at a newer property vs older ones. Understand the rental market and returns gained from the property, also what are the vacancy rates within the area. This will determine how long it may take to find a new tenant if your tenant leaves.

6. Find a good property manager

Once you have located a property, negotiated a sale price and exchanged contracts, begin researching local real estate agents to find a property manager with a good track record. Take the time to visit a few local agents, talk to them (interview them) and ask questions seeking testimonials from other landlords to determine their ability.

Once you have found the right agent for you, ask them to assist with the ongoing management of your property and future tenants, and agree on a management strategy. You can expect most agents to look for a commission of around 5% to 7% of the gross rent.

Set expectations on what they are to do. For example – all bills to go to the agent for payment and they only contact you for approval if the amount exceeds a certain number. If minor repairs are needed, go ahead with them, however major repairs require your approval.

Your property manager will issue you with monthly statements reconciling rent and expenses, and will deposit money directly into your nominated bank account. They are being paid to manage your property, so don’t do it for them – just manage your relationship with them.

7. Manage your yearly compliance requirements

Now that you have settled the property, you’ve found a property manager and you have a tenant in place, you should contact your accountant to discuss how you can assist your cash flow by lodging a PAYG variation.

You now know the income (rent) you are receiving after costs, the payments you are paying the bank and the impact on depreciation if applicable. Your accountant can now help you lodge a PAYG application with the ATO, and within a few weeks you should see a little extra cash in your pay packet. Also ask your accountant what information they require (and by when) to lodge your yearly tax returns, and how much this is this going to cost you each year so there are no surprises.

Remember, always seek professional advice where necessary to determine whether investing in property is appropriate for your individual circumstances.

"My wife and I bought our first home back in the early 1980s - a three-bedroom weatherboard house in a Melbourne bayside suburb. Before this, we rented a cheap flat (no telephone - we couldn't afford it) and after five years of sacrifice we managed to save a 33% deposit. We were very pleased and very excited about becoming home owners, especially since we weren't earning the big bucks - I was an accountant and my wife was a nurse. But we did it and even managed to pay off our mortgage within five years, meaning we were rent and debt free in our 30s.

Fast-forward to today and I can tell you there's no way we could achieve now what we did then. As we all know, long-term house price growth has far exceed wage growth, and the disparity is likely to continue. Back then our house cost us $60,000; we put down a $20,000 deposit and borrowed $40,000. In today's terms, even accounting for real economic growth, these are small numbers. To put things into perspective, to get into the same neighbourhood and the same type of property today you'd be looking at an entry price of around $1.2 million. That’s 20 times more than we paid all those years ago and way beyond what any young accountant and nurse could reasonably afford to pay in today’s market.

Related Article: 10 Strategies to Help First Home Buyers

This observation is borne out by the RBA’s May 2015 Housing Finance Commitments report, which shows an 11% drop in the number of first time buyers May on May and a 5% increase in their average loan size to around $340,000. That’s eight and half times more than we had to borrow when we first bought. The RBA statistics indicate something we all know – there are fewer first time buyers able to enter the market and those that do are having to take on bigger mortgages because of rising property prices, affordability issues and deposit gap issues.

Unfortunately, there's no quick fix to a problem that's been building up over the past 50 years. So what options are there for the average Australian to become a home owner or property investor when affordability constraints are now an inherent part of the property market? One option is to buy with friends, otherwise known as “co-owning”.

What is Co-Ownership?

Most of us are used to the idea of buying property with our spouse or partner, especially since two incomes are usually needed to meet affordability and loan serviceability criteria. When property is bought this way, it is normally done so under a joint tenancy where each party owns equal shares (e.g. a 50/50 split between husband and wife). In such circumstances, if one partner dies the surviving partner automatically gets the other's share regardless of any will provisions.

Co-ownership, or tenants in common, is where two or more people buy a property and own separate and defined shares - which can be equal or unequal depending on the agreement reached. In addition, if one party dies, their share of the property can be passed on or left to whomever they like. Co-ownership is therefore a way to get into the property market by pooling resources with other likeminded property purchasers, who could be family and friends or anyone else.

Advantages of Buying with Friends

One of the biggest advantages is that you can combine and pool your financial resources to significantly increase your purchasing and borrowing power. This will help you buy in more established and/or expensive areas where price growth potential and longer term profitability is likely to be greater.

You're also able to enter the market earlier. For instance, you won’t have to wait to save the full deposit or cover all the purchase costs (because your friends or co-owners are covering any shortfalls), which enables you to become a property investor or owner-occupier sooner.

Related Article: How First Home Buyers Can Get into the Property Market

The costs of buying and the day-to-day costs of owning a property are shared, meaning you don't have to carry the financial burden on your own.

Your home loan application could be enhanced through strength in numbers, giving you access to finance you might not otherwise have qualified for. Plus, you may be able to reduce borrowing costs by, for instance, collectively contributing a 20% deposit and thereby saving on lenders mortgage insurance.

Disadvantages of Buying with Friends

Of course there are some downsides to consider as well.

Lenders will undoubtedly lend on the basis of joint and several liability. This means each co-owner will be individually and collectively responsible for meeting all loan repayments and other obligations. The fact that you may own a greater or lesser share of the property than your partner(s) is irrelevant. If one or all of them skips town, you'll be left holding the bag.

If you buy with family and/or friends and things go wrong it could put a strain on your relationships. Remember that financial problems are a big contributor to marital breakdowns and the same principles apply when it comes to family and friends in a co-ownership arrangement.

Exiting a co-ownership arrangement is complicated and often impossible unless you can be bought out. In a worst case scenario the property may have to be sold, even if it's not in the best interests of everyone involved. Remember, you're financially committed to the venture and to your co-owners as well.

If you're buying to invest in property, there's no guarantee that you'll make the money you expect - be sure you do all of your homework, seek the advice of experts and ensure your fellow owners understand the risks and rewards involved.

Before You Commit: Key Considerations

If co-ownership is something you're seriously looking at, here are 5 key things to things to consider before you take the leap:

1. Take the emotion out of the equation...

When you're dealing with family and close friends with these types of arrangements you have to be objective - think with your head and not your heart. Make sure everyone gets independent legal advice and draw up an agreement that sets out everyone's expectations, rights and obligations. A formal agreement is great way to put issues on the table, identify problems you may not have considered, and to map out the way forward if things go bad. A good tip is to make sure you use a lawyer with co-ownership experience.

2. Buy with as few friends as possible...

Keep the numbers to a minimum (no more than three or four) to help reduce complications and complexities.

3. Choose your partners carefully...

Look for those you can trust and who share your views and passions about property (if you’re investing), or those you could live with if the plan is to become an owner-occupier. Always look to protect friendships and relationships.

4. Consider the risks – both personal and financial...

There are a number of things that could go wrong and you need to be comfortable that these problems can be dealt with amicably and sensibly. For instance, what happens if someone wants to sell and you don’t? Or if someone doesn’t meet their share of the mortgage payments or other household expenses and chores, and you’re the one who has to pick up the slack? Or what happens if there’s a major relationship breakdown between two of the parties that’s causing friction in the household? These can be serious issues that are not easily resolved, which could put you in a great deal of difficulty, both personally and financially.

5. Buy and borrow sensibly...

As with any property purchase, choose wisely and borrow wisely. The same rules apply whether you're buying on your own or with others.

"Market Summary

The Sydney house market continues to power ahead – recording an astonishing 7.58% growth in the quarter ending July, pushing the median value over the million dollar mark. The Sydney median house price now sits at $1,017,500.

To highlight the magnitude of growth in the Sydney house market, Graph 1 compares the quarterly growth of Sydney house values with the average growth of all other capital city house markets.

Graph 1: July Quarter Capital Growth - Houses

Table 1 presents the market performance summary for July.

Table 1: Market Performance

After Sydney, the Melbourne house market recorded the best rates of growth for the year ending July (9.07%) and the quarter ending July (3.10%). The median house value now sits at $683,000.

Brisbane houses performed steadily over the last year, however performance in the unit market was down due to an overhang of stock. The commencement of the Queens Wharf development in the heart of the Brisbane CBD (a complex which will include 2,000 new apartments) is likely to place further downward pressure on the growth of Brisbane units.

The worst performing areas in the year to July were once again the resource states. Darwin units and Perth houses suffered the biggest value reductions, dropping by 6.41% and 4.34% respectively.

A Note on the Resource Markets

A number of commodity prices have tumbled in the last year. The iron ore price averaged just AUD $69 per dry metric tonne over the month of July, which is a 13.88% reduction from the previous month.

Related Article: Could Commodity Values Explain the Housing Market?

Australian Thermal Coal remained steady over the last month, averaging AUD $85.75 per pound. However, this is a significant reduction from the peak price in 2008 when coal averaged over AUD $200.

World Bank data shows that resources boomed in the early 2000’s, following a long period of low valuation between the 1970’s and the 1990’s. While it appears that commodities are in a correction period, values have not fallen so drastically that prices are below what they were a decade ago.

In response to the decline in commodity prices, many suppliers, including BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, chose to increase efficiency and cost cutting as opposed to reducing supply. This is likely due to larger producers taking advantage of the fall in commodity values to pressure smaller suppliers out of the market.

In line with cost cutting, thousands of mining positions have been terminated across South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This, coupled with the completion of mining construction projects, is exacerbating economic downturn in the resource states.

Deterioration may be slightly offset in the short term due to the devaluation of the Yuan, which will make Chinese steel exports more competitive and drive demand for Australian Iron Ore, an input in steel production.

Commodity prices have a strong lead lag effect on dwelling values in the resource state capitals. As commodity prices stabilise at significantly lower levels, the Darwin and Perth dwelling markets are also stabilising.

To put the current growth cycle in perspective, the historical House Price Index (HPI)[1] data for Perth and Darwin is presented in Graphs 2 and 3.

Graph 2: Perth HPI

Graph 3: Darwin HPI

The graphs show that, like commodity values, dwellings in the resource capitals are no longer in a stage of rapid growth as they were between 2000 and 2008.

The Perth and Darwin markets are currently in a correction period, which is indicated by the downward movement of the HPI. However, putting the dwelling positions into a larger historical context shows they have not drastically collapsed.

During the mining boom, the Perth market saw annualised growth rates as high as 40% in 2006. However, these growth rates were met with corrections of 10% in 2009. The end of the mining boom has restored growth cycles that are much more subdued than these levels.

The New Normal – Ownership and Lifestyle in the Age of Population Convergence

Growth in the Sydney and Melbourne markets have concerned lending institution regulators, and hopeful investors and homeowners.

As discussed in previous newsletters, there is little evidence attributing foreign investment and tax structures to the surge in property values. I have not found sufficient data to argue rigorously that these forces are driving up prices.

Related Article: Sydney Boom Continues While Resource States Contract

There is another force that I believe may be attributed to house and unit value increases – particularly in Sydney: the concept of population convergence.

In 2005, American urban studies theorist Richard Florida built a case for population convergence. Measuring economic production, levels of innovation and population, Florida found that population and economic activity were converging to a few large cities around the world.

Evidence suggests that Sydney could be one of these cities. This would account for the positive returns on Sydney property over the last three years, which according to Residex data has averaged a rapid 3.05% per quarter.

At the time of Florida’s study in 2005, Sydney was one of just 60 cities around the world that had a population of approximately five million or more. Using World Intellectual Property Organization and U.S. Patent and Trademark data, Florida also found that Sydney was one of just 20 cities around the world to be fostering significant levels of innovation.

Population density in Sydney has increased approximately 16% between 2000 and 2012, according to data from Charting Transport. Increased density and the presence of more investors in the property market has led to an increase in the supply of units over houses. From September 2012, unit commencements have regularly outperformed housing builds, which can be seen in Graph 4. This further implies that most development is occurring in urban, densely populated areas.

Graph 4: Sydney Dwelling Commencements 

Population convergence theory could explain the growth in the house and unit markets, and signal that such growth is likely to continue. This is not unprecedented. Values and rents have skyrocketed in cities around the world, including Singapore, New York, London and Tokyo over the last few decades.

High rates of property growth are not just reflected in a desire to be near amenities, culture and cosmopolitan environments. Density also brings productivity advantages through economies of scale. It increases connectivity and knowledge sharing. In turn, these things create more jobs and attract a higher population, reinforcing population convergence.

In response to higher density living, many people have begun to adjust their standards of living in Sydney. However, a level of development resistance could further increase prices, such as a court ruling earlier this year which will see the minimum approval unit size in Sydney increase by 30%[2].

The methods inhibiting development are wide and diverse and therefore difficult to fully quantify; the prevention of new development can come from environmental regulation and community resistance.

These forces prohibit development of popular space and undermine innovations used to adapt to higher density, such as the micro-apartment movement. Resistance to development can also preserve a higher standard of living in Sydney, which – for those who can afford it – is clearly in demand.

Assuming Florida was right in his theory of population convergence, Sydney could see strong house value increases over the next few quarters before stabilising at a level that even the most wealthy and mobile will find excessive.

"Unless you’ve been hiding under a cultural rock, you’ll have noticed the rise of the hipster. They’re a movement categorised by shunning the mainstream and embracing the fringe. They’re at the cutting edge of retro-cool and enjoy talking a risk – try setting up a civet-coffee café in an industrial estate and see how long you last? 

The flipside is the irony. Never identify a hipster as a hipster – it’s very unhipster. They shun categorisation and if they hit upon a successful formula that sees everyday mortals adopt their vision, hipsters will flee from it as fast as their multicoloured Converse sneakers will carry them.

While it’s really, really amusing to poke fun at this subset, they are driving popular culture and deserve to be noticed. Find a location that’s firming as a hipster hotspot and you’re well ahead of the curve for a great investment prospect. Buy in low and wait for the cool to come – it’s gentrification at its purest.

HIPSTER-IFIC

Bernard Salt, demographer and partner at KPMG, says hipsters are market leaders and certainly a cross-section whose employment prospects and ideas will push capital city fortunes.

“I think it actually refers to [people] who see themselves as not really being connected into traditional Australian values… They see themselves as being very connected, very global, very digitally connected, creative, aware, politically active, environmentally active and at the leading edge of technology and progressive thinking.”

He says there are loose qualifying guidelines for hipsterism, but one rule is hard and fast.

“By definition you can’t be a dad of a teenager and a hipster… you can’t! You can wear whatever groovy clothes you want, you are not a hipster.”

HIPSTER-FIED

Salt says they’re mostly urban dwellers whose adventures to the fringes stall around eight kilometres from the city centre.

“It must be something in the atmosphere because when they go beyond seven or eight kilometres from CBD, they start to suffocate,"" he laughs.

“The oxygen is too thin, so if they’re out in Parramatta or at Penrith, they just curl up and die.”

Units in suburbs that are within a single-gear bike ride of the CBD appeal most, although hipster desires may evolve once they start to breed.

“Then they have children and they’re determined to stay in the city, but then comes the great cultural clash – do they remain in the city or do they respond to the lure of the suburbs? That’s the great existential crises that hipsters go through,” Salt says.

“I think we’ll see an increasing proportion of hipsters as buyers going forward and that’s because you convert to hipsterism at the age of 22 or 23, and you might be all hip and groovy and renting throughout your 20s, but at some point you’re going to want to buy a property, and you’ll want a property that fits with your values and your lifestyle and your tribe. So, I think we'd see more first homes sold to hipsters in their early 30s going forward.”

Finding out about hipster locations before everyone else is both exciting and potentially profitable. Salt has his own tongue-in-cheek take on the beacons of a hipster market, but he’s not far off the mark.

“I’m sure if you’re at a café and there are smashed avocados on the menu, then follow the line of smashed avocados.”

It’s certainly true they lead with a coffee culture, but while location is one thing, nailing down an appealing property is another. At this stage, the vast majority are young renters looking to set up in areas beyond their current financial reach. If you want the right bait to hook a hipster, keep it simple, Salt says.

“They do like black, they do like minimalism and they like quirky Danish design… It’s got to be genuine, authentic, nose-bleedingly expensive Danish design rather than practical, pragmatic, minimalist Ikea.

“Polished concrete is very popular, calacatta marble, that sort of white with swirly black veins throughout – I think that’s more of a corporate 30-something hipster rather than a 25-year-old.

“But again, hard surfaces and natural products.”

Salt’s take on hipsters is a mild ribbing in good nature, but his points are well made. Hipsters are a driving force that’s well worth watching. They’re an exciting, creative, smart community who will give most things a go. Just the sort of population you want in new markets.

George Raptis of Metropole Property Strategists says the evolution of cool Newtown has been an obvious case of ‘hipsterfication’.

“If I had taken you to Newtown 30 years ago, the demographics were quite simple. It was very blue collar, working class and high crime rate. In the main CBD, [around] King Street, you’d see a number of shops that were continuously vacant.

“It had that sigma attached to it, but what we’ve seen happen is that suburb has changed completely. The old demographic moved out and the new demographic moved in.”

He says property has become quite expensive in Newtown and there’ve been flow-on benefits for addresses nearby.

“People that wanted to be there have said, ‘Look, that’s too much for me to afford. I’ve got to buy or rent, but I’ll look at little suburbs that piggyback onto that, which are still convenient to these particular spots, that we can still access the places where we like to go, and have the green tea and vegan sandwiches’.”

Raptis says similar urbane suburbs include Surry Hills and Darlinghurst. If you’re looking for areas with gentrification potential, he says look for commercial and industrial conversions.

“Places like Alexandria, Beaconsfield, possibly Forrest Lodge, which is close to Glebe, these sorts of locations. These areas were, once upon a time, working class with a lower socio-economic demographic, but predominantly scattered by commercial and industrial properties. These uses have subsequently moved out.

“The [hipsters] that can afford it like renting these old, period properties, these terraced places. They like that style of living. They don’t need cars to get around. They’re used to public transport or push bikes and scooters.”

Raptis says businesses, and particularly markets that appeal to alternative living, are booming in these areas, so keep them on your radar.

Paul Osborne of Secret Agent Buyers Advocates says Melbourne’s established café culture is already a comfortable fit with the hipster ethic – it’s almost regarded as their Australian spiritual home city.

“Melbourne is obsessed with lifestyle and the good life. Great coffee, excellent but affordable restaurants/bars and small batch producers such as organic produce stores and farmer markets are all things attached to this subculture. The masses want these things, too!”

His pick of established cool areas are Collingwood, Brunswick and Northcote. When considering evolving localities with potential for alternative appeal, he stays north of the Yarra with Footscray, Preston and Spotswood.

“I think they’re good when it comes to rents. The hipster demographic is renters, and tends to be happy to pay strong rents for the right location. You could find that investors pick up benefits from the increasing rents within these areas.”

Zoran Solano of Hot Property Specialists Buyers Agency says the hipster scene in the Sunshine State has been a strengthening force, and property owners are now reaping the rewards.

“We are seeing interior styling taking daring new directions, the introduction of recycled materials, retro features, and splashes of bright colours.

“These are all telltale signs of hipster influence, but in real world examples, we’ve seen sale prices in some suburbs being pushed ever higher.”

He says Brisbane’s three established cool locations are West End, Fortitude Valley and New Farm.

“The cafés feature milk crate seating and single-origin coffee.”

Solano says areas that are beginning to gain a vibe include inner-ring established suburbs such as Moorooka and Annerley on Brisbane’s south side.

There’s even an overflow effect as other areas become less affordable.

“Areas like Newstead and Albion, which adjoin New Farm and Fortitude Valley, are now becoming secondary hotspots and are locations to keep an eye on moving forward.”

“Today’s hipsters are just a yuppie with a Ned Kelly beard (if you’re a male) and wearing less make-up (if you’re a female). We have bars, clubs, cafés and laneways in the CBD and suburbs that entice the hipsters to get out of their rented period homes and onto their retro bikes.”

He says the subculture abounds in Goodwood, Wayville and Glandore, just south of the CBD, with public transport and bikeways at the residents’ disposal. Koulizos says emerging hipster suburbs include Croydon, West Croydon and Thebarton. These inner-western areas are transitioning away from industrial to residential.

“Evidence of attraction to hipsters is the number of retro bikes parked outside popular cafés and eateries, and the murals on power poles and old factory walls. There are often community gardens on the footpath, too.”

“We definitely have a hipster scene. Ours are a slightly different breed, and are clearly discernible from the Fitzroy hipsters that migrate to Hobart during MOFO (music festival).

“Hipsters don’t drive cars so the suburbs where they live are all walking or biking distance from there.

“Based on this metric, our hipster suburbs are the inner-city frame (Central Hobart) tucked away in conversions, North Hobart, West Hobart, and for the trendsetting hipsters, Moonah.”

Moonah and surrounds is definitely breaking as hipster central, Duckett says, because of excellent cycling infrastructure, an abundance of old character industrial buildings begging for conversion, and a great migrant population – and it’s starting to accommodate artists and creatives, too.

“As with any cultural trendsetters, the hipsters, artists and creatives form the innovative pointy end of the bell curve, so it goes without saying that mainstream property prices will rise as a result.”

Gavin Hegney from Hegney Property Group says the hipster culture is alive and well in our most western capital. Given its distance from our large east coast population, the DIY ethic of the subculture is often drawn upon.

Perth also has a little something extra to offer – lifestyle choice.

“The two hipster suburbs are Mount Lawley for the city dwellers and Scarborough for the beach dwellers,” he says. “Mt Lawley is an inner-suburb just north of Perth set along Beaufort Street, which is lined with cafés, one-off shops, small bars and entertainment. It’s proposed to put a light rail tram along Beaufort Street linking it to the city.

“There’s a mixture of property from older style one-bedroom units around $400,000 through to larger character homes around $2 million.”
Hegney says Scarborough is appealing to the 20-somethings who want to be ‘where it’s at!’

“Younger people like to group and don’t really want to be where there’s too much grey hair. Maybe hair dye could change a suburb from blue-rinse to hipster?”
Hegney says the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority has a big vision for the Scarborough beachfront including an ocean pool, amphitheatre, redeveloped surf club and piazza, as well as density bonuses to stimulate redevelopment and general beautification of the area

“Up and coming hipster suburbs are East Victoria Park, Northbridge, West Leederville and South Fremantle.”

"Have you noticed that there’s not too much talk about Greece at the moment. China has captured the headlines.

China’s share market rout has sparked global attention for numerous reasons. In Australia, there is now talk that China’s share market fall, or crash as some describe it, will put the lid on the Sydney and Melbourne property markets.

Will this be the case?

Let’s think about it… But first, here is a little bit of recent history.

Although the top of any bubble is hard to pick, there are often things that generate a few warning signs. That was the case recently in the Chinese equity market.

China’s Shanghai Composite came to life in the second half of 2014 and began to accelerate to the upside in early March 2015. By the beginning of April, there were some warning bells as signs of rampant speculation emerged. Outstanding margin debt on China’s two major bourses rose to excessive levels and mainland investors opened stock trading accounts at the fastest pace ever. These are classic symptoms of speculative behaviour.

Related Article: Sydney Boom Continues While Resource States Contract

Between 8 May and 16 June 2015, the Shanghai Composite Index rallied by 26%, taking the advance from July 2014 to just over 150%. Then it was over. The market declined by 34% into early July.

So where does that leave us?

If the Chinese equity market has indeed registered a major peak, how will that affect Chinese investment in Australian property? As always there are two sides to the discussion.

On the pessimistic side, some argue that the fall in the stock market has had a negative wealth effect on the Chinese wanting to invest in Australian property. They also argue that many investors have already paid a deposit on a property but may find it difficult to settle. This could put downward pressure on property prices.

The other negative argument is that the ‘crash’ may affect the broader Chinese economy, lowering growth and again lowering the wealth of the Chinese investor.

On the other hand, yes, the equity market has fallen dramatically, but in reality it has reverted back to where it was in March. So it is only the investors who came late to the party that will be in the red. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that the ‘smart’ investors may have sold ahead of the peak, and ahead of the ‘pack’. Now, with the continued fall in the Australian dollar, those who are cashed up are seeking a safe and less volatile haven in Australian property.

As far as the effect on growth rates are concerned, we should keep in mind that share prices on the Chinese stock market do not necessarily reflect the underlying health of the economy. A recent article in The Economist maintains that the tradable value of the Chinese market is about 40% of GDP, whereas in mature economies it is typically more than 100%.

Remember that Chinese growth has slowed over the past couple of years as the share market has rallied. So the correlation is not great.

So who will be right - the pessimists or the optimists?

It’s a fairly evenly balanced argument so it could be either. But even if there is a slowdown in Chinese investment, it could simply stabilise overall demand rather than bring it to a standstill.

And what if the Chinese market comes to life again? That’s a thought for another day.

"The ATO has created a new system for SMSFs using a contribution reserving strategy, following complaints about costly and complex roadblocks to implementation.

The ATO has now released a form - Request to adjust concessional contributions - which notifies the tax office that a member of an SMSF has made concessional contributions in one financial year (year one) but their SMSF did not allocate them to the member until the next financial year (year two).

Most SMSFs use provisions in their trust deeds in relation to contribution reserves to enable this contribution reserving strategy, DBA Lawyers director Daniel Butler told SMSF Adviser.

The strategy allows contributions to be recognised for income tax deductibility in year one but not counted towards the concessional contributions cap until year two.

The ATO acknowledged that the SMSF annual return does not otherwise make provision for it, but only allows for the correct reporting of contributions that are both allocated to SMSF members and contributed in the same financial year.

Prior to the release of this new form, to use the contribution reserving strategy taxpayers would have to go through an objection process.

This is in spite of the ATO confirming that this is a valid strategy under the tax and super laws, according to the view outlined in TD 2013/22, which is a binding ruling, on the assumption that all the associated legal requirements are met.

“This is a big step forward for contribution reserving strategy that now has the ATO backing and a system that works without incurring the expense of an ATO objection,” said Mr Butler.

“We used to say to taxpayers, don’t do a contribution reserve unless you’re prepared to object – that scared people off,” he added.

“This new system is going to make it a lot more effective to do contribution reserving without the downside and administrative hassle of an objection and the extra expense.”

"The latest statistics reveal that Sydney houses have achieved a record high annual growth rate for the current housing boom, of 20.36%. The median house in Sydney is now valued at $993,500, which is a dollar value increase of $168,000 in the year to June 2015.

While Sydney continues to be the clear growth driver, the resource states – Darwin and Perth – have suffered contractions in growth, with the decline in volumes and values of iron ore taking its toll on these markets.

Related Article: 10 Strategies to Help First Home Buyers

The Darwin unit market recorded the worst annual growth performance in the year to June (-5.31%), while Perth suffered the worst value retraction in the house market (-1.05%). Table 1 presents the results to June 2015 for the major markets across Australia.

Table 1: Market Update

An Australia wide aggregation of the property market displays strong annual growth of 6.28% and 6.06% of houses and units respectively. However, annual capital growth rates by city tells a very different story – see Graph 1.

Graph 1: Annual Capital Growth Performance

Graph 2 displays the impact of iron ore exports on the property markets in both Perth and Darwin.

Graph 2: Iron Ore Exports and Resource State Property Growth

Available export data shows the percentage change in the value of exports up to January of this year, compared with the change in values of properties in Perth and Darwin. Unless the resource businesses based in Western Australia and the Northern Territory can sustain low prices for exports, we should not expect an improvement in these housing markets for the next few months.

Unlike the resource states, it is harder to identify the driving force behind the growth in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets. Anecdotal reports exist on foreign investment and baby boomer investors driving up property values, but these factors may or may not be the cause of the current boom – no one has the data to prove that this is the case.

For example, the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) monitors foreign investment in housing. In November last year, the government reported an inquiry into the FIRB to see how foreign investment impacted property values. The findings revealed that the FIRB had not kept record of the citizenship status of property purchasers, or taken court action against foreign investors since 2006. Without detailed information on who is buying property and how they are doing it, we cannot confidently or academically attribute foreign investment to increased property values.

Despite a lack of data, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has begun an inquiry into negative gearing and parts of the media are calling for its abolishment. The government has begun designing policy to deter foreign investment in housing. These ad hoc policy responses are not based on evidence that they will remedy an overheated market.

Jamie Alcock, Associate Professor of Finance from the University of Sydney, defended negative gearing – arguing that it had little direct impact on the latest housing boom. This may be supported by historical housing finance data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which is displayed in Graph 3.

Graph 3: Housing Finance and Fiscal Reform

An increase in investors in the housing market suggests that a higher quantity of properties are being traded for investment, because more money is being lent to investors rather than to people buying property to live in. Investor financing Australia-wide overtook the amount lent to investors in 2014, which was unprecedented in the dataset (see Graph 3).

Related Article: The Infrastructure Investigator

Negative gearing, which allows investors to claim asset losses on their taxable income, was reintroduced by the Hawke-Keating government in 1987. The capital gains concession, which halves the amount of tax to be paid on profit from the sale of assets, was introduced in 1999. By highlighting where these policy changes exist in the time series, it can be seen that they do not seem to have a direct impact on the convergence of investor and owner occupier buying activity.

You can also see times of economic recession (red) and economic downturn (orange) in Graph 3. One could argue that the increase in investment is aided by the tax concessions introduced by the Hawke-Keating government, but that it also has to do with economic performance. Furthermore, the convergence between investment and owner-occupation between 2011 and 2015 could be attributed to increased overseas investment, or the relaxation of rules pertaining to borrowing from self-managed super funds (which occurred around 2010). Note that there is a lag between fiscal reforms and their impact on the market.

Reflecting the increase in housing investment, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has ordered a change in the weighting of property from 16% to 25% in internal risk modelling for big banks. The implication of this is that the major banks – who use their own risk modelling to determine the amount of capital they hold – must adopt this weighting and hold billions of dollars more in reserves to safeguard the financial system. This will be enforced from 1 July, 2016. If the cost of holding more capital is passed onto the investors who take out loans, loans will either require a higher deposit or be charged at a higher rate. Either way, this risk mitigation policy could see a dampening of the housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will hold rates for August at 2 percentage points.

The decision came in the context of a disparate, two-tiered economy and the RBA waiting on the latest economic indicator movements (a ‘wait and see’ approach). Concern over the bluntness of the interest rate was met with increasingly stringent regulations from Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which were announced from May this year.

The AUD was hovering around US $0.727 this morning, which is relatively low for the last five years. The RBA hoped to use interest rates to lower the value of the dollar in order to boost Australian exports in a time of sluggish domestic growth.

The RBA does this by cutting the cash rate. As well as interest on borrowing, the cash rate also represents the rate of return on the AUD. As the rate of return on Australian money is lower when the cash rate is cut, it becomes less valuable to hold and so the worth of the dollar falls.

It became clear this year that the RBA could not achieve a low dollar through cutting the cash rate because the AUD is measured relative to the US dollar, which has been slipping in the last month due to poorer economic conditions. The AUD is therefore less likely to motivate a rate cut.

The unemployment rate increased to 6.00% in June from 5.9% in May. This was coupled with an increase in the participation rate from 64.73% to 64.8%, suggesting the unemployment rate increased partially as a result of more unemployed people participating in the job search process. The July labour force data should indicate how these job searchers are absorbed into the economy.

Annual wage price growth was at a five year low in the quarter ending March 2015, at just 2.3%. The June quarter also saw low inflation, which was last recorded at 1.5%, suggesting slower future wage growth.

Related Article: 10 Strategies to Help First Home Buyers

The inflation rate is below the RBA target band of 2 to 3%. Lowering the cash rate drives inflation because people have more money available to bid up the prices of goods. This means there could be a further cut in the next few months if the RBA prioritises getting the economy within the inflation target.

The price of iron ore picked up in June, averaging AUD $81 per dry metric tonne for the month, as opposed to AUD $76 in May. This will benefit the resource sector in the short term, but detract from the much needed economic diversification in areas such as Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

The above indicators suggest that Australia could benefit from further economic stimulation, as unemployment remains high, inflation is low and our resource sectors are struggling.

What does holding the cash rate mean for our housing markets?

The housing market across Australia, like our different sectors, is disparate. Most dwelling markets across Australia are performing poorly. In fact, if you take NSW out of the equation, the average, median capital growth rate in houses is just 2.31% for the year to June. Meanwhile, Sydney houses saw a 20.36% increase in values in the year to June.

ABS finance data tells us that the majority of the money taken out for residential dwellings are going to investors. At April this year, the amount of money borrowed by investors to fund the purchase of dwellings was approximately $13-billion, as opposed to owner-occupiers who borrowed approximately $12-billion.

In response, the APRA is enforcing a limit on the growth of investor loans to no more than 10% a year. In the second quarter of 2015, the Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and NAB expanded dwelling investor lending at a higher rate than this. More stringent reforms have since come into place, with banks required to have higher levels of capital reserves against loans. The big four banks have, in the last few weeks, raised interest rates on investor housing loans between 0.27% and 0.29%.

The regulations by APRA give the RBA flexibility to sustain a low cash rate, and even cut it further, while dampening investment in Sydney houses and units.

The problem with this is that unaffordability in the Sydney market means that some lower income earners in Sydney would prefer to purchase properties for investment in other markets, while still being able to rent in Sydney. The regulations make it more expensive for investors to buy in other markets across Australia, and could potentially harm already struggling dwelling markets in other states.

"In Part 1, we looked at the following strategies:

1. Education, education, education
2. Seek advice
3. Learn to budget
4. Start saving early
5. Be prepared to make sacrifices

Related Article: 10 Strategies to Help First Home Buyers - Part 1

Here are the remaining 5 strategies to consider in order to help aspiring buyers achieve the goal of owning their own home.

6. Don’t borrow more than you can afford

A trap every young buyer must avoid is borrowing more than they can really afford. This can happen when you are tempted to take on a bigger home loan so you can buy that bigger or better property – where you are sometimes tempted by glossy brochures and slick sales techniques.

To help ensure this doesn’t happen, you need to set a budget and stick to it, focusing on the properties in the areas you can afford rather than spending time looking at properties outside of your price range.

The ultimate objective of staying within your budget is to avoid becoming a slave to your mortgage, which can lead to financial and emotional problems, not to mention reducing the satisfaction and enjoyment you might otherwise get from being a home owner

7. Plan to trade up

We all want the ideal home – something we’re proud of that ticks all the boxes when it comes to things like location, features, aspect, size, number of bedrooms, garden and proximity to amenities and public transport - and the list goes on.

Although there’s nothing wrong with aiming high, when it comes to buying your first home being realistic is more important than getting everything you want first go. The reality is, the ideal home probably doesn’t exist – or, if it does, it is likely to be way out of your price range.

This is where the application of the principles of wants and needs plays an important role in helping you select the type and location of properties to aim for, especially when affordability is factored in to the equation.

A challenge you may face is aiming for a home that is as good as your parents or the one you’re currently renting, or you may be seduced by slick sales techniques into thinking your need something bigger and better than you really do.

Related Article: How First Home Buyers Can Get into the Property Market

In these circumstances, it is important to remember that most of us (myself included) made sacrifices when buying our first home. Once you are on the property ladder, it can be easier to trade up as family finances permit and when changes in personal needs and preferences (like starting a family) signal it’s time to move.

8. Buy with your head

Buying your first property is a big deal, full of excitement and emotion. And therein lies a potential trap if you buy with your heart and not your head.

The risk is, you may focus more on how a property makes you feel rather than, for instance, whether it meets your practical needs and of course whether it is affordable.

As a result, your judgement may become clouded and this could lead to problems like spending more than you can afford, buying the wrong property or ignoring defects that could cost you thousands to repair.

So it’s important to be as objective as possible when choosing a property and this extends to the buying process as well.

For instance, you (like everyone else) need to avoid getting caught up in the emotion of the auction process where it’s the job of the auctioneer to engage with bidders to encourage them to bid more. Therefore, the key learning point here is to check your emotions at the door.

Related Article: Low Interest Rates Are Not Good News for Everyone

9. Start with an investment property

The challenges associated with saving a deposit and ongoing home loan affordability can be a hurdle too high for many aspiring young buyers.

As discussed in my previous article – How First Home Buyers Can Get into the Property Market – buying an investment property, as strange as it may sound, can help overcome these obstacles in three key ways:

1. By generating rent: This can be used to pay off your investment loan. Then, once finances permit, you could move into the investment property and call it home.

2. By generating capital growth: This could be realised through the sale of the investment property and the proceeds used as a deposit.

3. By generating equity: This could be used as additional security for your home loan. This equity may also help reduce the need for expensive Lenders Mortgage Insurance.

10. Walk away

As disappointing as it may be, it may be a better option to walk away from buying a property than committing to buy and discover that it’s really not what you wanted or that you’ve over-committed financially.

With rising property prices, it’s understandable that you may want to buy now rather than face a potentially higher purchase price in a year or so, and/or higher home loan costs if interest rates increase. But these are not the sole basis on making your decision to buy. Sure, these considerations are important, but acting in haste or without careful reflection can lead to regret and personal and financial problems down the track.

One of the big benefits of patience and discipline is that our young buyer can live to fight another day.

"In this state-by-state review we've asked town planners, legal experts and professionals to share their go-to sites and research for infrastructure projects, so investors can become better investigators before signing on that dotted line.

“You don’t know what you don’t know” rings true, especially when it comes to unforeseen infrastructure, proposed freeways or neighbourhood development approvals, which all can affect the potential value of an impending property purchase. In a recent edition of API we featured the story of an investor who, at the eleventh hour, discovered a freeway was due to be constructed a couple of houses down the street. This intel didn’t come up in her conveyancing report, but fortunately the buyers’ agent she hired at the last minute discovered this vital piece of information, saving her financial bacon.

Related Article: 10 Strategies to Help First Home Buyers

The puzzle masters

Principal of Suburbanite Anna Porter is the property advocate, or property fairy godmother, who discovered that pending freeway on behalf of her client. She says it’s actually common for this type of essential information to be missed in conveyancing reports. As in the freeway case, Porter says it didn’t directly affect the property and therefore wasn’t noted on the title but it was still close enough to significantly affect the house in question’s value. So, can buyers rely on conveyancing reports to inform them of upcoming infrastructure or developments that could have an impact on their property value? Not always.

“The conveyancers/solicitors will look at the property directly, the title and the legalities of the contract, but it’s not within their scope of work to assess all surrounding development and its impacts,” she says. “It’s not up to the conveyancer to make this assessment for you and they’ll likely not even alert you to projects in the area, as they’re probably not aware of them. This is just not inside the scope of their role or terms of engagement.”

To increase your chances of discovering any problems before it’s too late, give an experienced solicitor or conveyancing paralegal detailed instructions, solicitor Rae Harrild of Landmark Lawyers says.

“Discuss items such as, ‘what do you as the buyer intend to use it for? What’s the nature of the property? Do you have any concerns?’ And then go through a list of potential searches provided by your solicitor in detail to tailor a search package to meet your needs,” she says.

However, some of these searches mightn’t be included in the solicitor’s fixed fee.

Service vs Cost

When enlisting your chosen solicitor or conveyancer, check which standard searches are offered and compare with competitors.

“Solicitors who offer fixed-fee conveyancing often have a shortlist of ‘standard’ searches included in their conveyancing price. Some firms offer additional services in their ‘standard’ package and the price generally reflects this,” Harrild says.

“Clients deserve a comprehensive service, law firms want to deliver a comprehensive service, but the first question most clients ask is, ‘how much?’”

Harrild’s advice for buyers is to do as much research about the property as possible before signing the contract.

Once you’ve carried out your research, run it by your solicitor. If you’re concerned about freeways, or any particular issue affecting the value of your property, ask them how you can discover that information and what rights you have under the contract.

“Buying a house with your solicitor or your conveyancer is teamwork – you have to actively get involved for the best outcome. Read the materials provided by your solicitor, ask lots of questions and don’t assume anything,” Harrild says.

Know your zone

As a solid step in your due diligence, Malcolm Gunning, president of the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales (REINSW), says check out the local council website for planning information and the surrounding zoning.

“Your zoning mightn’t be straight residential, it might be mixed zoning or if zoning says you can build medium- to high-residential, be aware of it,” he says.

Porter points out that what won’t show up in the conveyance check is if next door is zoned high-density and the neighbours have plans to develop a unit block, which really sucks for you when the 19 new next-door neighbours will be able to happily observe you splashing about in your backyard pool.

“This again falls outside the solicitor’s scope so it’s important to check all the surrounding zonings,” Porter says.

If you’re buying a unit as an investor and there are a lot of unit developments planned near your property, this could oversupply the market.

“Oversupply is the single biggest risk to any investor to create rental vacancy and stagnant or even declining values,” Porter adds.

Who can you call?

Ali Hammoud, director of Planzone Consulting, says the local town planner is a sure bet.

“Every property investor should have a town planner’s contact number in their phone or address book if they don’t already,” Hammoud says.

“In addition to a conveyancing report, buyers should seek the advice of a town planner to do some background research on any unlegislated state and local government changes to planninglegislation, major development and infrastructure projects that may affect the property and area.

“This information can be vital and while easy for a town planner to find, can be easily missed by a conveyancer.”

Investor searches will vary between states, but generally your search should include both state and local government websites.

“In New South Wales, the Department of Planning and Environment offers an online mapping service where buyers can search for a property and view the various planning affectation layers that apply to each property,” he says.

“One of the important layers buyers should check in relation to infrastructure is the ‘land reservation acquisition’ layer. This layer will identify whether a particular property or land nearby has been reserved by the government for future public land for recreation, infrastructure including roads, rail or airports or other public utilities.”

This review can help identify an area where future infrastructure is planned that may boost the value of a property, he says.

“Missing this review can leave you with a property that’s undevelopable and may be subject to compulsory acquisition by government should they move ahead with the purpose for which the land is reserved,” Hammoud says.

An example of this is Sydney’s WestConnex project, a motorway project that had been dormant for more than 30 years. Hammoud says it’s now in full motion with reserved properties being acquired to make way for the planned road.

Local treasures

When in doubt start with the locals, Gunning says.

“Any prudent investor would go to their local group of shops, the local coffee shops and say, ‘I’m buying the house up the road, what sort of area is this?’

“People say that’s dumb, but it’s not. The locals will tell you if it’s a good or bad spot, if the bus terminates at your front door and leaves its motor on all day, or if government has been talking about a new a road for 50 years but no one thinks it’s going to happen.” As we’ve learnt, sleeping main roads don’t always stay inactive.

“Then get onto your local council, search the road and traffic web portals so you’re able to pull this information up. All of your findings are additional information you can take to your lawyer who can advise further on the necessary searches or steps required,” Gunning says.

“What I’d do, too, if I was buying, I’d go knock on the neighbours’ door. They’ll give you a snapshot of the area.”

If you’re thinking of contacting your local town planner it doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg, either. Hammoud says his firm generally doesn’t charge for initial consultation that requires one to two hours’ work.

Your local valuation firm is another option for some honest and professional feedback.

“Ask to engage them for a few hours and pay to pick their brains. They’re a wealth of knowledge on their local market and have no bias like the local agents might,” Porter says.

And of course good ol’ Google works a treat, too.

“You’d be surprised what you find by googling the address, the area, the suburbs and the word ‘development’ or ‘project’. This is a great place to start,” Porter says.

“One website alone won’t give you all the answers you need. It’s a process of working through many sources of information and doing it in a very quick timeframe so that you don’t miss out on a property, nor do you rush in and make a costly mistake,” Porter says.

Checklist

Here’s an example of the typical searches a buyers’ agent will do before purchasing, so you can do it, too!

Surrounding development and zonings.
Development Application (DA) registers.
Sales and ownership information in the area (i.e. is the house over the back fence owned by Department of Housing?)
Roads and maritime for main roads that may segment a suburb or be a bit too close to the property for comfort.
Ownership databases and past sales.
A good question to ask your buyers’ agent before you engage them is what due diligence do they research and how far do they go to get these answers?
Pre-purchase reminders

Here is a list of REINSW President Malcolm Gunning’s pre-purchase reminders:

Google the area.
Check with the local government and state government on any surrounding plans/infrastructure.
Talk with locals.
Title search.
Strata search-strata report. If it’s a strata-title property never buy a property without a strata report. It will show you what’s in the sinking fund and if there were/are any issues raised with the body corporate.
Never buy a freestanding property without a survey.
Make sure if it’s a non-residential investment the use complies with the zone.
If you’re buying non-residential remember a building report,  which isn’t common practice for commercial purchases.

"There is an old saying in regards to the equity market that ‘time in the market is more important than timing the market’. Some believe this is true while others disagree, suggesting market timing – that is, buying and selling at the correct time – is the key to successful investing. For those clever and disciplined enough to successfully time their sales and purchases, the correct timing will obviously enhance their performance.

Related Article: The Persistent Two Tiered Housing Market

Given that property markets also undergo cyclical swings in performance, is it possible to predict the correct time to buy and sell? Perhaps, but just as with the equity market, sentiment will swing from one extreme to another. When prices are low, the mood is sombre and the general consensus is that things will get worse before they get better. People will defer buying believing that prices will continue to decline.

When prices are high, as they are now, the opposite is true.

But does it really matter when we buy and sell? If this is our first home purchase, yes. But for those who are already exposed to the market it may be less critical, or so they say.

You often hear people say that as long as you are buying and selling in the same market it doesn’t matter about timing. But this is not necessarily the case. If you are one of Australia’s many baby boomers looking to downsize, selling in a rising market is advantageous.

Consider this.

You own your house in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. The children have left home, your gardens and pool are becoming harder to maintain, and you really don’t need that third or fourth bedroom. The idea of moving into a home unit may be appealing as a unit offers less maintenance, easier access, and to top it off some extra money to allow you to retire with a better standard of living.

Let’s say your house is worth $2 million. The type of unit you wish to purchase may be worth $1.2 million. The difference (let's leave costs out of it to keep it simple) is $800,000.

If the property market rises another 10%, your current home will be worth $2.2 million and the unit you wish to buy will increase to $1.32 million. The difference is now $880,000 which is extra $80,000 in your pocket. If the market goes down by 10%, the house would be worth $1.8 million while the unit drops to $1.08 million – the difference now being $720,000 or $80,000 less.

So, if you are a baby boomer looking to downsize you are better off selling as the market is rising rather than after it begins to stabilise and perhaps turn. Keep that in mind. We are in a strong market; there are those who will benefit and those who will struggle. If you are keen to downsize, be one of the former and consider selling as the market is robust.

"Saving and investing – these two things, when done effectively, can pave the way to a comfortable retirement. But for most people, this is easier said than done. If you haven’t yet started saving for your retirement or made use of property investment strategies to increase your portfolio, now is the time to do so. The earlier you prepare for your retirement, the better.



To help you with this, here are 5 tips for you to follow:

1. Track your spending

You need to know where you’re at right now financially. A good way to gauge this is by knowing where your money, every dollar of it, gets spent every month. So list down all your expenses – from mortgage payments to occasional dine outs. Also include other expenses such as bi-monthly, quarterly or annual payments like insurance payments.

2. Simplify your life and redefine luxury

Based on your current expenses, separate the necessities from the luxuries. Cut down or completely take out the unnecessary expenses to make room for more savings. Also reconsider your necessities. Discuss with the family if all of these are really needed, or if there is something that you can do without. Redefine luxury as well by planning to indulge in less expensive possessions and experiences.

3. Make your savings inaccessible

With the adjustments made to your monthly budget, you’ll now have more money going to your retirement fund. It is very important though to keep this fund and or investments untouched (other than periodic reviews) until your retirement. There will be many circumstances where you’ll be tempted to borrow from this fund (and never pay back again), and in most cases it may even be due to reasonable situations. But if this keeps happening, what was supposed to be your retirement fund will become your emergency fund. To avoid this from happening, place your savings in a tough to access, investment and retirement plan.

4. Put your money to work

After you’ve saved three months’ worth of your salary, use part of your savings for investment. Don’t just rely on your savings and instead put your money to work. Do not ignore the power of leverage and compound growth, make these work for you.

5. Start with a low-risk investment

You can start with a low-risk investment then work your way up. To know what type of investment would work for you, you are best to ask for help from a financial expert. Discuss with them your retirement goals and the span of time you’d want to achieve these in. They will be able to advise you and may even help you with asset protection to ensure your wealth and asset base are safeguarded, and you can fully enjoy these during your retirement. When investing seek assistance and always do your research.

"QLD Also Wins Property State of Origin

The latest research conducted by Onthehouse.com.au reveals the nation’s top performing suburbs for both high rental return and strong predicted capital growth – with Queensland defeating New South Wales by 41-18.

The data revealed 56 suburbs across Australia where rental yields are above five per cent and capital growth predictions are at least three per cent over the next eight years. Of these suburbs, 41 per cent were found in the Queensland area, while News South Wales boasted only 18 per cent of suburbs on the list.

Related Article: Property State of Origin

The following table reveals the Top Five rental return hotspots in Queensland:

While the Sydney housing boom has provided enormous capital growth returns – annual growth for the median house peaked at 20% in January 2014 –this has also priced a lot of hopeful homebuyers and investors out of the market.

After three rounds of comparison, it is clear that investors should be looking to the Sunshine State to get onto the property ladder.

Round 1: Rental Yields in Sydney are Going Down

The median house in Sydney has an estimated rental yield of just 3.62 per cent, according to May 2015 Onthehouse data. Graph 1 demonstrates the declining rental yields in for the median house in the Sydney Metropolitan region since the start of the 2012 housing boom.

Graph 1: Sydney Rental Yields

The reason rental yields have declined during the housing boom is simply because rental yields are measured as a percentage of the house value. In real dollar values, rents in Sydney rose 9.45 per cent in the year to May 2015, but this increase was not as rapid as the rise in house values themselves.

Related Article: An Economics Lesson for the Treasury: Why do Rental Yields Go Down as House Values Go Up?

Negative gearing can assist in covering the gap between rental incomes and dwelling expenses, however another potential wealth growing strategy could be to look for more affordable properties where tenants pay rent that is significant compared to mortgage and interest repayments.

Rental yields in Brisbane are also trending down with capital growth, but they are relatively stable. This can be seen in Graph 2, which shows the rental yields for the median house and unit in the Brisbane metro area.

Graph 2: Brisbane Rental Yields

These high rental yielding properties can be found in suburbs that are affordable, but also desirable for people to rent in. Ideally, the rent received would be enough to positively gear an investment. Positive gearing is very rare in the greater Sydney metro region because of high unaffordability.

This is a great potential strategy for young people in Sydney and Melbourne who are keen to get on the property ladder, but have been priced out of these metropolitan areas.

Round 2: The Deposit Hurdle can be Enormous in New South Wales

Investors must accumulate a large deposit to enjoy the rapid capital growth occurring in Sydney suburbs, where the median house value is now $961,000. The median Brisbane house is valued at almost half of this, at approximately $484,500.

A salient trend among top yielding suburbs is affordability. Of the suburbs featured on our list of 56, 75 per cent hosted dwellings with a median value below the national median of $491,000 for houses and $452,500 for units.

Related Article: Market Update: The Persistent Two Tiered Housing Market

Round 3: Value for Money

Rental yields in Queensland are not just strong as a factor of affordability. Increased infrastructure projects, such as the Moreton Bay Rail Link and the development in anticipation of the 2018 Commonwealth Games (to be held on the Gold Coast), has helped absorb employment following the tapering off of construction and commodity prices in the mining sector. Sustainable growth in dwellings is a reflection of the performance of the local economy.

Time-money trade-offs are another consideration for investors and tenants. In both Queensland and New South Wales, the best rental yields were found on the fringes of the greater metropolitan areas. However, what constitutes ‘fringe dwellings’ is quite different between the two states.

In Queensland, for example, Logan Reserve and Tanah Merah were suburbs with rental yields above 5.50 per cent, situated less than 40km from the Brisbane CBD. The median houses in these suburbs were valued at $394,500 and $408,000 respectively. These suburbs have not yet experienced urban sprawl, and could therefore have a lot of growth potential.

In New South Wales, the top rental yield suburb in the Sydney metropolitan region had a median value of $540,000 and is located almost 60km from the Sydney CBD. In addition, Sydney has a high rate of density growth, creating a larger cost for buyers per square meter.

There were 10 suburbs featured in New South Wales, and suburbs in south-western Sydney dominated this list – which are on the fringe of the greater metropolitan region. Sydney’s south-west has proved an affordable alternative for businesses and families seeking cheaper rents and costs of living. This is making the City of Campbelltown close to a regional city of its own.

High rental yield suburbs can be a great way to enter the property market on a budget.

"Queensland gives NSW a Run for its Money in Property Stakes

QUEENSLAND may be a property underdog but it has beaten New South Wales soundly on one important property score, and is punching above its weight on others.

Image Source: LJ Hooker

When it comes to rental market indices, Queensland suburbs are kicking New South Welsh butt, making up double the top performers NSW has, according to Onthehouse.com.au research.

Market analyst Eliza Owen, who helped put the figures together, said Queensland was “a clear victor in the rental investment market” defeating New South Wales 41-18 in percentage terms.

“The data revealed 56 suburbs across Australia where rental yields are above 5 per cent and have a capital growth prediction of at least 3 per cent over the next eight years. Of these suburbs, 41 per cent were found in the Queensland area, while New South Wales only featured 18 per cent of suburbs on the list,” she said.

While some may scoff at the idea of the Queensland market emerging on top given recent surges in the NSW property bubble, the latest Onthehouse.com.au figures showed the state was giving the southerners a good run for their money.

Related Article: The Persistent Two Tiered Housing Market

LJ Hooker national research manager Mathew Tiller said the bragging rights were evenly split at 7-all.

“Unsurprisingly, the hot Sydney property market ensured NSW scored the points for the highest median price (Point Piper, $5.3M) and highest value of sales (Mosman, $1.57B),’’ said Mr Tiller.

“And Double Bay homeowners will be sitting very comfortably, having notched a 151 per cent increase in the worth of their properties over the past five years.”

But he said for investors, Queensland was now the go.

“For investors, Queensland holiday retreat South Stradbroke Island (18.9 per cent yield) offered the strongest return, while Dysart ($125,000 median) offered the cheapest property,” he said.

“And there has been significant level of interest in Surfers Paradise - which was heavily hit after the financial crisis - which recorded the most sales over the two states in the last year.”

LJ Hooker head of real estate Christopher Mourd was sure there’d be high passion on both sides of the border regardless of what score anyone was looking at.

“Whether you own on Sydney’s Palm Beach, or rent on the Gold Coast’s Palm Beach, you’ll think your address is better than your interstate namesake in terms of lifestyle and value,’’ he said.

"The RBA has announced it will hold the cash rate at 2 per cent in July. The decision was expected as the cash rate cut in May seems to have created little momentum in the Australian economy.

The decision came as Greece is at risk of low liquidity, stalling business and an exit from the eurozone. China is a large exporter of consumer goods to Greece, and, in turn, Australia is a large exporter of resources to China. The effect of the ‘Grexit’ crisis could therefore temporarily stunt Australian exports.

However, this is likely to be partially offset by a low Australian dollar, which fell to 75 US cents last Friday. This is the lowest AUD figure since May 2009. The low Australian dollar is a result of uncertain markets, particularly in China, putting downward pressure on purchases and demand for the AUD.

Attempts made by the RBA to depreciate the dollar through the cash rate had a perverse effect in May, following a 25 basis point cut. This is because RBA Governor Glenn Stevens made little indication of a further rate cut this year. Rather than depreciate the currency, investors bid up the price of the AUD to 80 US cents the following day, assuming that interest rates would hold steady and gradually increase from this point.

Further hindering the effect of the cash rate on the AUD are the US and Japan, who were the first movers in depreciating their currencies. As the AUD is measured against the USD, cutting the cash rate will do little for the AUD before the US moves to increase its interest rates.

The weak ammunition of the cash rate, combined with uncertain markets, seems to have created a lower AUD, incentivising a hold in the cash rate.

Movements in other economic indicators are mixed.

Unemployment decreased to 6 per cent in May, down from 6.1 per cent in April, and full time employment increased by 147,000 positions in May, though this follows a decrease of 241,000 positions in April. The participation rate fell by just 0.01 per cent in May, suggesting a general improvement in the labour situation.

The deeper problems facing Australia’s labour force, including creative destruction, an aging population and the decline of the resource sector is something the RBA has little influence over. The economic situation in Australia is worrying, with the

"Increasing property prices and poor affordability continue to push many buyers out of the property market – which is especially the case for first time buyers. In my opinion, it is harder to become a home owner today than what it was back when I bought my first home around 30 years ago. 

The declining trends in first time buyer activity and the upward pressures on property prices in the major capitals (especially those in the eastern states) suggests that this situation is unlikely to improve for many young aspiring home owners over the next 5 to 10 years.

As a passionate advocate for first home buyers, I have put together 10 key strategies to consider in order to help aspiring buyers achieve the goal of owning their own home.

Below are the first 5 of my top 10 strategies.  

1. Education, Education, Education

Most of us are familiar with the real estate agent’s mantra 'Location, Location, Location' when it comes to buying residential property – but what’s equally important is Education, Education, Education.

Related Article: How First Home Buyers Can Get into the Property Market

Here is a list of things every first home buyer should be considering in order to make the right decisions when buying their first home: 

How the property market works – what drives prices up and down
How to budget, save and manage one’s personal finances
How to successfully apply for a home loan
How to choose the right home loan product
How to borrow – for instance, directly from a bank, building society, credit union, specialist mortgage lender, or indirectly through a mortgage broker
How to manage a mortgage
How to find a property
How to choose between different property types, sizes and locations
How to value a property
How to inspect a property
How and when to get in the specialists like a valuer, property inspector or pest inspector
How to successfully bid at auction or negotiate a private treaty sale
How to deal with all the parties involved in buying and selling residential property, such as: the selling agent; buyer’s agent; seller or vendor; mortgage broker; lender; insurance companies; property lawyer or conveyancer; utility companies and moving companies
How to prepare and handle the emotional ups and down of searching for, buying and owning a home

This is not an exhaustive list. There is so much to learn so time and effort is required, along with access to the right information. Because there is so much to learn, it is a good idea to start the education process as early as practical, which will ideally be well before you are ready to sign on the dotted line.

A great advantage of a good property education is knowing what questions to ask, and to be able to objectively and knowledgeably assess and consider the answer or advice given. A good residential property education helps avoid being misled or making the wrong choices.

2. Seek advice

Whilst having the right knowledge and education is an important foundation for first time buyers, so is the ability to use and apply this knowledge wisely and appropriately. However, without the benefit of experience, it can sometimes be difficult to know how and in what circumstances to apply what you’ve learned. Situations may also arise where you aren’t prepared or have the life experiences necessary to deal with the challenges, obstacles and opportunities buying a home can present.

This is where seeking the wisdom of others can pay real dividends (and by wisdom I’m referring to the combination of knowledge and experience). Seeking advice before, during and after buying a home is vitally important, and it should ideally be sought from someone who is reasonably independent to help ensure there is no bias in the advice being given.

Related Article: Low Interest Rates Are Not Good News for Everyone

If the person giving the advice does, for instance, have a financial interest in what’s being discussed, such as a mortgage broker (advising on a home loan) or selling agent (advising on a property on their books), then it’s important to understand this and take it into account when considering your options.

A good starting point for getting impartial advice is to approach family and friends first, especially those who have gone through the buying process before and understand the opportunities and pitfalls that lie ahead. The benefit in doing this is that it helps you avoid making the same mistakes your family and friends may have made when they bought their first home.

In saying all this, it is still important to seek out professional and specialist advice. For instance, talking to mortgage brokers, selling agents, accountants and tax specialists, and legal advisors is very important as they all have the experience and technical knowledge needed to help ensure you are making informed and considered decisions.

3. Learn to budget

There is a universal truth for first time buyers and that is unless they know how to budget, buying a home will be extremely difficult.

A budget is more than just a way to monitor your spending, it is a prerequisite and powerful tool for planning, managing and controlling almost every aspect of your personal finances.

Think of a budget as a personal financial blueprint – you wouldn’t build a house without a plan so you shouldn’t try and build your financial future without one either.

In simple terms, budgeting helps you achieve financial goals (like saving for a deposit or meeting regular monthly mortgage payments) by comparing income with expenditure and determining whether there’s enough cash left over to put towards these goals. If there isn’t, it helps identify whether more income is needed, or if spending has to be cut (and where savings may be made), or both.

Budgeting requires an understanding of income and spending patterns, and it takes time, practice and bit of trial and error before it can be done with reasonable accuracy. This is why it’s important to learn how to budget as soon as possible so when it comes time to buy that big ticket item, like a home, you have the skills, experience and self-awareness of your spending habits to know what can realistically be saved and what you can realistically afford.

4. Start saving early

3 key benefits of starting to save early:

1. You should be able to save a bigger deposit

The savings rule is a simple one: the sooner you start saving, the more you’ll save. It sounds obvious I know but let’s take a look at a real life example to really drive home the point.
Saver 1 is 20 years old, while Save 2 is 25. They are both thinking about buying a home when they turn 30.

Saver 1 has 10 years to save while Save 2 has just 5 years. Assuming that they can each save $10 a day, or $70 a week, their respective savings at age 30 will be:

Saver 1: $10 x 7 (days) x 52 (weeks) x 10 (years) = $36,400
Saver 2: $10 x 7 (days) x 52 (weeks) x 5 (years) = $18,200

As you can see, Saver 1 saved twice as much as Saver 2 with their 5 year head start. However, there is an important aspect that we have not yet considered, and that is the compounding interest effect that was described by Albert Einstein as “the most powerful force in the universe”.

Assuming both of our savers deposit their savings at the start of the month and earn 4% interest per annum, payable monthly in arrears, and this is added to their account each month over the life of their savings, let’s revisit the figures (pre-tax savings by age 30):

Saver 1: $44,815 (including $8,415 of interest)
Saver 2: $20,178 (including $1,978 of interest)

Saver 1 has not only saved more capital, but they have also earned considerably more interest due to the powerful combination of saving more and earning interest on interest. In fact, Saver 1 has increased their total savings by over 23% due to the compounding effect of interest, compared to Saver 2 who has only increased their savings by 11%.

This is a compelling reason to start saving as early as possible as it pays big dividends in the long run.

2. You can reduce your borrowings

A big advantage of saving more is that, all things being equal, you may be able to borrow less. And when it comes to home loans, less is good.

Borrowing less can save you a considerable amount of interest expenses over the life of your home loan, as well as reduce (and hopefully eliminate if the deposit is big enough) amounts that may need to be paid for expensive Lenders’ Mortgage Insurance.

Let’s again compare our two young savers at the time they are ready to buy and check out what the relative savings in interest costs could be, based only on what they can put down as a deposit.

Assumptions:
Both are buying similar properties at identical prices.
Home loan is for 25 years, at 6%.

Saver 1 has a deposit of around $45,000. Save 2 has a deposit of around $20,000 – meaning they need to borrow an additional $25,000 to buy their property.

How much more will Save 2 have to pay back because they had to borrow an additional $25,000?

The answer is an extra $161 per month, or around $48,300 over the life of the loan. This means Saver 2 will have to pay a whopping $23,300 extra in interest.

I think most of us would agree you can make better use of this extra $23,300 rather than having to hand over this hard earned cash to your lender.

3. Learning financial discipline

Another important benefit of starting to save early is that it helps teach financial discipline. This discipline arises because the savings target won’t be reached unless enough cash is put aside each week, fortnight or month, and this requires sensible choices as far as saving and spending is concerned.

Establishing good financial habits early on is a great way to prepare for financial commitments down the track, such as having to pay things like ongoing and regular monthly mobile phone bills and (eventually) home loan payments.

5. Be prepared to make sacrifices

There’s an old saying that goes, “No pain, no gain”. This is exactly the case when it comes to saving up to buy your first home.

The fact is, most first time buyers will need to make spending sacrifices to find the extra cash they need to save a decent deposit in a reasonable period of time. This is where understanding the difference between needs and wants is very important.

Simply put, a need is something you have to have in order to live, whereas a want is a nice-to-have but you could live without just fine item. A need might be food, rent, clothing or a car, whereas a want can include designer clothes, expensive overseas holidays, regular meals out or a huge flat screen TV.

A great way to quantify how much is being spent on needs and wants is to go through expenses (actual or budgeted), identify which is which and mark each with a different colour. Then you can add them up and take a critical look at spending habits with the goal to cut out spending on wants as much as possible.

It’s also important that you don’t forget the little things when looking for cost savings. For instance, if you are buying a $5 cup of coffee a day, you’re spending $35 a week or $1,820 a year. Cutting this out would equate to $9,100 in savings over five years, and $18,200 over 10 years!

Of course, any sacrifice should be made over a period that is reasonable and sustainable. In the case of our coffee example, a compromise might be to cut down rather than cut it out altogether.

"Why do Rental Yields Go Down as House Values Go Up?

On Thursday, 26 June, a parliamentary inquiry into housing affordability in Australia began.

In spite of a lack of housing supply in Sydney and Melbourne to keep up with demand, rental yield return for investors is going down. There is a very simple explanation for this and yet it is something the Treasury officials struggled to account for last Thursday.

Related Article: How to Explain Housing Affordability to the Treasurer

Onthehouse.com.au has data on rental yields for Sydney houses and units for over 25 years – which are plotted in Graph 1. Graph 2 plots the same data category for Melbourne. Both graphs display rental yields are falling over time.

The latest statistics reveal that annual growth in the Melbourne house market shot up 8.18% in the year to May 2015, which is a dollar increase of about $55,000. While this is a far cry from the $160,000 value growth in its Sydney counterpart, it represents a rapid increase in values.

"Tax strategies for property investors to consider.
1. Documentation

Keep summaries of all your rental income and expenses.

This is much easier if you have your management agent looking after your property where they pay all expenses and collect all income. They will normally provide a monthly and annual statement.

Ensure you have all bank statements showing interest expense. The annual statement should show a summary of interest expense.

A specialist property accountant can assist by ensuring all allowable tax deductions are made.

2. Depreciation

Only registered quantity surveyors are generally authorised to prepare depreciation schedules. If you are contemplating a renovation, a quantity surveyor can produce a scrapping schedule which puts a value against all items to be thrown away. This value is expensed in the year of expenditure. The new items are then depreciated with a new depreciation schedule.

3. Travel

All costs endured to inspect your investment properties are tax deductible, including travel. Ensure you apportion any personal component.

4. Interest Expenses

Only interest expenses on borrowed funds used to invest are deductible. It is the purpose of the loan which determines deductibility, not the security used to obtain the loan.

A split loan should be considered when a loan is used for both investment and private purposes.

If capitalising interest, the tax office may require evidence of correct documentation and intention.

Interest deductibility should be easy, but if not properly documented and managed this expense can cause frustration if the ATO decides to conduct a review. Therefore, the assistance

"Here are some of the most common mistakes I see people make when they purchase a property through their Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF).

1. Debt

Your SMSF can be used to borrow money for the following:

Purchasing a property, including all acquisition costs.
Pay for repairs and maintenance. 
Capitalise interest.

You cannot use borrowed funds to improve the property. Improvements include additions, a granny flat and extensions etc. For these activities, cash resources of the fund must be used. You can however use borrowed funds for cosmetic renovations.

It is critical to keep good records in your SMSF to identify when borrowed funds or internal cash is used. When debt is used, the property must be held in a Holding Trust with a Corporate Trustee, and not directly in the SMSF.

Apart from the legislative requirement to not hold the property directly in the SMSF, there are real and practical reasons why you would not want to hold it in the SMSF.

2. Associated Party Loan

Many people use external funds to assist them in purchasing property in their SMSF by contributing the cash as a non-concessional contribution. The problem with this is that once you have made the contribution, you cannot get the funds back until retirement - or worse still - you cannot put in sufficient funds within the allowable limits. You can however lend the funds to your superannuation, which allows its release if refinanced. There are also no limits on the amount of the loan.

The mistake that many people make is to lend funds to the SMSF with a simple loan agreement. The loan agreement must meet the limited recourse borrowing requirements of the legislation, as well as clearly identifying all terms and conditions. Note that market interest rates must apply.

3. Renovations

Renovations that merely return the component back to a new condition are classified as repairs for the purposes of the superannuation borrowing legislation. Therefore, a cosmetic renovation that replaces the existing kitchen or bathroom is allowable, even with borrowed funds.

The mistake often made is to improve the kitchen - for example, by way of extending the bench area or knocking down a non-load bearing wall. These would be deemed as improvements

"Research is the cornerstone of any successful investment. At no point should you consider taking a shortcut or cut corners when it comes to your research. Without thorough and comprehensive research, you won’t have the information needed to make a sound decision.

However, there is a dark side to due diligence. In your bid to cover all bases, you could spend a lot of time doing your research and get bogged down with every bit of information that you come across. This is one of the insidious aspects of the process that you have to be aware of. In your desire to reduce your risks, you lose focus on your goal, which is to buy an investment-grade property.

When you spend excessive amounts of time conducting your due diligence, you delay making key decisions for fear that you don’t have ‘enough’ information to make that call. At worst, you get swamped with your research that you become ‘paralysed’. You’re stuck doing the background checks without actually using it as it was originally intended: to help you make a decision and take action.

How to un-paralyse yourself

So, how do you achieve a balance between research and action? Here are a few tips based on my personal experience and from the proven strategies practised by the best minds in the business.

1. Realise that you will never have all the information you
    need to make the decision.

This is one of the most difficult concepts for me to get my head around. Being a control-freak and research obsessive, I simply could not make a decision without double checking, triple or even quadruple checking everything.

But it’s important to realise that you will never get all the information you need to make an educated decision. And this is ok. If you wait for all the information to become available, you’re likely to miss out on the opportunities out there. Good quality investments won’t stay long in the market and they won’t wait for you to make up your mind.

"Sydney is now one of the world’s most expensive cities to live in.

Recently, Treasurer Joe Hockey denied a housing affordability problem, arguing that if there was one – people would not still be purchasing houses. The Treasurer argued that as a starting point to buying a house in Sydney, non-home owners should make an effort to seek high paid employment.

However, the limited data available that tells us who is buying homes is indicating that it is investors buying up property and NOT hopeful homeowners.

The price signals in Sydney’s housing market disguise the fact that most of the population cannot afford to buy houses and units in Sydney based on their income.

"While the RBA’s decision to cut the official cash rate to a historical low 2% is good news for existing and aspiring residential property buyers because of the knock-on benefit of cheaper home loan finance, it is also a sign that we face difficult times ahead if Australia’s economic situation does not improve.

I say this because I am mindful that interest rate cuts (which started way back in November 2011) were instigated to, among other things, stimulate our economy and help redress Australia’s rising unemployment. I don’t want to put a dampener on what is generally good news for borrowers, but the current low interest rate environment is not good news for our economy.

In saying this, and notwithstanding the RBA’s economic motivations for reducing interest rates, the residential property market can benefit when rates are low or falling. This is because lower interest rates typically lead to:

Lower mortgage repayments, which may enhance loan serviceability and affordability.
Increased or sustained market activity because there are more active buyers (and hopefully sellers).
As a result of the first two points and given supply side constraints, property price growth can ensue.

Generally speaking, this is good news for the market as a whole, but it may well be that these perceived benefits are not available to everyone. A prime example of this is whether or not the low interest rate environment has made it easier or more affordable for first time buyers to enter the property market.
With this in mind, I have put together my top 5 reasons why low interest rates are not be good news for everyone.

1. Property Price Growth Create Barriers to Homeownership

Whilst property price growth is generally considered a good thing (because it builds equity and can create wealth), accelerated growth is not necessarily good for the market as a whole, although investors or property speculators would be very happy with above trend price increases.

However, when prices increase above reasonable and sustainable levels, there is greater risk of a property bubble forming and possibly

"Let's talk Aussie $ and the ASX

There is a lot of talk with regard to whether or not Australia’s property market is in bubble territory. Extreme views have always made the headlines – that is why we often see ‘crash’ predictions for the equity and property markets. And even as many argue that RBA Governor Glen Stevens is fuelling the current boom with a continued reduction in interest rates, it pays, as always to read the so-called ‘fine print’. In other words look beneath the headline data.

The below table provides median house value movements in both Sydney and Melbourne since the year 2000.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will hold the cash rate for June at 2 percentage points.

The decision was made in a time of economic fragility. Australia’s economy is experiencing sluggish growth, falling employment and rising debt, both at a national and household level. In spite of this, the Sydney house and unit markets are in their longest, largest boom in over three decades.

The first quarter of 2015 showed that the year on year growth rate in Australian GDP was 2.5 per cent, down from 2.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014. It is forecast to fall to 2 per cent in the June quarter. 

April data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Australia’s unemployment rate rose to 6.2 per cent in April, up from 6.1 per cent in the previous month. April also saw a marginal decline the participation rate, from 64.79 per cent to 64.76 per cent.

Full time employment fell in April by a 21,900 persons, highlighting insecurity and casualization in the workforce.

The Australian Wage Price Index, representing wage growth, remained at a record low of 2.3 per cent, which is typical in times of relatively high unemployment. This is because employers do not have to give workers incentive to stay on with higher wages. The 2.3 per cent growth figure is well below the 15 year average of 3.5 per cent.

At Onthehouse.com.au, we have noted over the last few months that the RBA is trying to address a complex economy with a blunt instrument. The rate cuts earlier this year were an attempt to stimulate spending by business and consumers.

To an extent, the Federal Government delivered complementary fiscal policy to try to direct cheap money into business investment. Such policy included allowing a $20,000 tax offset for asset expenditure.

"Financial and property markets can be tricky things. Despite the plethora of research and analysis available, and the copious amount of time spent trying to determine the direction of short, medium and long-term trends, markets have a habit of surprising us.

Even if we knew the details of data that was to be released to the market, we can still be incorrect in our views on how that data will be received. Take for example the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to cut the cash rate in early May. Normally you would expect that action to have a negative impact on the Australian dollar (AUD) and a positive effect on the sharemarket. But that didn’t happen, instead the dollar ended over one per cent higher on the day and the sharemarket was flat.

It is not the news that drives markets; it is the reaction to the news. Basically it boils down to sentiment. And sentiment is driven by psychology. And that is why markets can be driven by one thing one day and another thing the next.

Think about this. The Australian property market has been pushed higher in recent years by falling interest rates. It has also been boosted by overseas investors buying as the dollar has fallen from its peak of $1.108 in July 2011. The dollar began to accelerate to the downside in April 2013 and it is since that time that the property market has really taken off. And it keeps going. After the last RBA rate cut the Sydney auction market recorded its highest clearance rate ever (89.2%).

But what if the AUD has bottomed? Will that drive overseas investors away? 

The first thought is ‘probably’. But it is often perception rather than reality that drives markets. 

And sometimes the markets can act perversely. So here is something to think about. If the Australian dollar continues to rise, overseas investors who have delayed purchasing, in anticipation of
further dollar weakness, may decide that they need to enter the market now, rather than risk a dollar at the 85 or 90 cent level. That could give the property market a further boost.

"Small businesses and young families were clear winners in Treasurer Hockey’s second budget, which was handed down on the 12th of  May. No policy announcement was specific to Australia’s house and unit markets, however the proposed fiscal policy has implications for economic growth and employment, which in turn will influence dwelling demand. Some of the proposed fiscal measures may even have a direct influence on housing markets.

Something other than Sydney Housing Expected to Boom

As noted in my latest statement on the RBA cash rate cut, fiscal policy was needed to ensure the historically low cash rate was not just taken advantage of by property investors, as this risked further inflation of the Sydney and Melbourne markets. Investors could not be blamed for seeking the highest possible returns on their money, so fiscal policy was needed to divert funds elsewhere.

Therefore it was promising to see the immediate tax deduction of assets up to $20,000 available for small businesses[1]. The incentive to buy capital goods is likely to stimulate consumer confidence, which has was last measured at 96.2 in April, down from 100.7 in February[2], as well as stimulate retail activity, manufacturing of capital goods and employment as small businesses demand assets. Essentially, this policy will promote the flow of capital into goods and services, rather than dwelling assets which are appealing for high return.

Other benefits for small businesses included tax concessions. There was a 1.5 percent tax cut proposed for small business, and a 5 per cent tax cut of up to $1,000 a year for unincorporated businesses.

Employee Share Schemes also saw proposed reform for employees, under which employees offered shares in start-up companies will not have to pay tax on them until the shares are sold. Fringe Benefits Tax on portable electronic goods will be abolished, incentivising employers to supply their workers with capital goods that may improve their efficiency. 

While these measures are financial incentives for small businesses, there are a couple of underlying economic factors which will ultimately undermine the capacity for growth.

The first is education. While the Government has committed to increasing funding to schools in line with CPI, this is a reduction of planned spending by the former Labor government.

"How to use an investment property as a stepping stone into your first home.

Buying your first home has vast similarities to climbing a mountain – not only is it hard work, you often hit what is known as a false peak.

In mountaineering, a false peak is where a climber ascends to what looks to be the top of the mountain, only to discover it is nothing more than a ridge that has obstructed the real peak behind it. This can be disheartening because of all the hard work that has gone into the trek thus far, not to mention the discovery that there is still some way to go before the true summit is reached.

The term false peak can also be applied to non-mountaineering activities where obstacles posing as the end goal produce similar feelings of dashed hoped (or even failure) – such as the process of buying your first home.

When buying your first home, you go through the hard work of saving a deposit – which often takes years – but the deposit itself is not the final destination in your home ownership quest, it is only the ‘ridge’. The true destination will only be reached when the final mortgage payment is made and you own your home outright. In the meantime, you have to make regular mortgage payments, on time every time, otherwise you will struggle to make it to the top.

Bridging the deposit gap and ongoing mortgage affordability are two big obstacles first time buyers face, and for many it has become a mountain too big to climb.

So, how can you move into your first home if you don’t have a deposit big enough or you can’t afford mortgage repayments? One way, as strange as it may seem, is to buy an investment property and use it as a stepping stone into your first home.

With this in mind, here are 3 ways to you can use an investment property to help you into your first home sooner. 

1. Create Rental Income

You may have found a property you would like to call home but you can’t quite afford to buy it as an owner-occupier just now. The solution – if the property is well-located and is in an area with good rental demand, buy the property as an investment and lease it out. This way, you can get a tenant who will help pay off your mortgage until your finances improve. Once you are on top of your finances and can afford to take on the whole mortgage, you can move in.

You would have to buy and borrow wisely but this approach would help your cash flow and could accelerate your loan repayment if you combine with your tenant and contribute more than the minimum mortgage payments.

2. High Growth for Capital Gain

More often than not, your first home is not going to be your dream home. To get a foothold on the property ladder, you may need to go down the investment property path first and buy a property you can afford NOW. This does not have to be in an area you ultimately want to live – in fact many people have investment properties in areas outside of where their primary point of residence is.

Buying an investment in a suburb that offers high capital growth potential allows you to sell the property after a few years of solid growth, and you can then use the after tax proceeds to help fund your new home.

If you choose to adopt this strategy, you should aim to find areas that offer potential returns in excess of other asset classes, like online savings accounts. At the very least, aim for capital growth rates of inflation plus at least 2%.

>This can be an effective way to bridge the deposit gap, and if the property performs really well, it could help reduce the amount you ultimately need to borrow to buy your new home. This thereby improves affordability and savings on interest, and will perhaps even save you needing Lenders Mortgage Insurance if you can get the loan-to-value ratio under 80%.

3. Build Up Equity

Similar to my above strategy, buy an investment in a suburb that offers high capital growth. However, instead of selling the property for a capital gain, you can borrow against the equity you have created to help fund your first home.

If you choose to go down this road, you need to be mindful that this option requires you to manage the debts associated with two mortgages, so it is very important that you do your sums and don’t overstretch your financial capabilities.

In closing, here are some important issues to consider if you plan to explore any of the above options further:

Prepare a Budget

Make sure you prepare a budget and get independent tax and accounting advice. You need to ensure the approach you want to take stacks up financially (cash flow and tax) and that it is likely to meet your home ownership objectives in a timeframe you are comfortable with.

Risks vs. Rewards

Make sure you understand the risks as well as the rewards of property investing. For instance, you need to be ready to take on the financial and personal responsibility of being a landlord. You also need to remember that investing in property is investing in an illiquid asset – so you may not be able to liquidate your investment as quickly as you would wish.
 
Know the Market

Property prices can go down as well as up, so there may be some risk to your capital. Also, you’ll need to set a minimum three to five year time horizon to recoup acquisition costs and generate a decent capital growth.
 
First Home Buyer Grants

Check with your State or Territory whether there is any effect on your eligibility for first time buyer grants and concessions if you buy an investment property first. The criteria for these change regularly so make sure you’re across any developments.
 
Track the Market

Keep a close eye on how your investment property is tracking in terms of cash flow and capital growth. Any material divergence needs to be investigated and actions taken without delay.

"Following on from the latest Property Market Update: House and Unit Growth Disparity Widens, regarding houses in capital cities recording higher growth than units, Onthehouse.com.au has put together a list of 50 suburbs with a disparity between the house and unit market growth during the last quarter.

The list is further evidence of why it is so important to not just prioritise where to invest, but also what type of property to buy.

The subsequent suburbs are all in NSW and Victoria, with some areas having house median values more than double that of their unit conterparts.

The difference in growth was particularly noticeable in the Sydney's prestigious suburbs of Bronte and Kirribilli, where house values jumped by 6.84% and 6.70% respectively over the last quarter. During the same time period, unit median values dopped by 0.29% in Bronte and 0.16% in Kirribilli.

Meanwhile, in the more affordable Victorian suburbs such as Fawkner (12km north of the Melbourne CBD) and Taylors Hill (25km north-west of the Melbourne CBD), there is not a massive difference in values between houses (Fawkner: $475,000, Taylors Hill: $473,000) and units (Fawkner: $339,500, Taylors Hill: $321,000).

However, in both cases, houses performed stronger than units during the last quarter. In Fawkner, houses recorded growth of 6.31% in the last quarter while units dropped 0.69%. Over in Taylors Hill, house values increased by 3.91% while units vales fell 0.56% in the same time period.

"Your Guide to Building Your Property Portfolio Safely and Quickly

Let’s face it. Growing your property portfolio is not an easy feat. There are a number of hoops you must jump through and you need to have nerves of steel to deal with unexpected issues arising from your investments.

Yet there are many ordinary investors who are creating extraordinary wealth through property. So, why are so many investors getting stuck with just one property?

Why the Vast Majority Get Stuck at #1

1. Unsuccessful first attempt

There’s nothing like a failed first attempt to put you off investing altogether. It’s human nature that when things go well you want more of it. Yet when things don’t go as you had hoped they would or as you were told they would by the smooth-talking marketing agent you bought the property off, then you don’t make that mistake again.

2. Overwhelming fear of something going wrong

Fear is a potent force that cripples a lot of people into inaction, especially when it comes to investing. Many investors fear they’ll lose money so they hold off buying any more property.

3. Lack of planning

Another common reason why people fail to grow their portfolio is that they don’t have a plan on what to do next after buying their first investment property. Without a clear goal, you won’t know what to do next.

4. Inability to get a loan

Hitting your borrowing limit could seriously hold you back from expanding your portfolio.

Therefore, when you are buying your first or second property it is very important to keep these issues in mind. Ideally, you want to find a property that is both positively geared and has capital gain potential within 12–24 months.

5. Buying negatively geared property

Buying properties that require you to put in your cash to hold them will severely limit your ability to grow your portfolio.

Related Article: Property Market Update: House and Unit Growth Disparity Widens

Despite speculation that growth in the Sydney market would spill north to Brisbane, devastating weather conditions and the deterioration of commodity prices mean that the greater Brisbane region has seen subdued growth so far in 2015.

Our latest data shows that the median house value in Brisbane contracted by 1.33% for the March quarter. Units did not do much better, with growth of 0% in the same period.

Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt described the Federal Budget as a “let down for Queensland”.

Related Article: What the Federal Budget Means for the Housing Market

The State Government was chasing funding for a cross river rail, the second stage of the Gold Coast light rail and the Sunshine Coast rail duplication.

However, the Federal Government has announced its infrastructure loans are conditional, and Queensland will not receive full federal support unless it agrees to sell its assets.

Unless the State Government can negotiate further infrastructure funding, Queensland may see subdued economic and employment growth.

This is further reinforced by the abolishment of the tax free threshold for those on a working holiday in Australia.

The reform could reduce tourism, which has provided a crutch for the Queensland economy following the tapering off of the mining boom.

Any fiscal policy impacting tourism is also important for those with holiday rentals to consider, as rental returns could go down and vacancy periods have the potential to go up.

"The RBA released its Financial Stability Review on the 24th of March. In the review, the RBA acknowledged that increased investor demand for housing causes speculative investment. This has occurred in the Sydney housing and unit market, which is less a place for finding somewhere to live, and more of a trading floor to make money.

This is supported by ABS data, which shows that home loans taken out by first home buyers have steadily decreased from 18.8% in 2012 to 14.9% in 2015.

The effect of more investors coming into the market, is higher volatility. Volatility is a measure of how extreme or dispersed your returns on something will be. The higher the volatility, the higher your returns will be. The flip side of this is that your losses will also be larger. Let’s look at the historical return of Sydney Houses and Units:

Graph 1: Historical Growth of Houses and Units in the Sydney Metropolitan Area

The graph demonstrates historical growth in houses and units for the Sydney metro region in the last 25 years. The way it is represented here is the rate of growth over the past 12 months, as measured at all the months between February 1990 and February 2015.

In the graph above, the growth rate movements are fluctuating with greater highs and lows from the year 2001. Sydney experienced a growth high of 25% in 2001, and a huge correction, to the point where growth actually contracted by 3% in 2004, and this contraction continued for the following three years.

Just before the graph cuts off, there are two little spikes in houses that show where it looked like the Sydney market was beginning to correct. Around the same time the RBA announced a February cash rate cut.

Demand related policies such as the government signalling crackdown on foreign investment and the RBA holding interest rates in March, suggests the Sydney Market may finally settle down. The question of how much a correction the market experiences, depends largely on supply.

Business Insider Australia reported at the beginning of this month that approvals for construction in Australia’s unit market has hit a

"The Reserve Bank of Australia announced it will cut the cash rate by 25 basis points at its May Board meeting, to a historically low 2 per cent.

The rate cut was announced amongst a mixed bag of performance in economic indicators.

The RBA held the rate in April in anticipation of the latest unemployment data, which showed unemployment improving, though marginally. The unemployment rate dropped from 6.2 per cent in February to 6.1 percent in March.

Similarly, the participation rate increased by 0.1 percentage point, suggesting the employment rate decreased as a result of people finding work, as opposed to falling out of the labour force.

However, Australia experienced a sluggish GDP growth rate of 2.5 per cent for the year to November, 2014, and a deteriorating balance of trade. These are clear signs that while mining kept the economy buoyant during the GFC, it is now lagging while the rest of the world slowly recovers. Low inflation, sitting below the RBA target band of 1.3 per cent in February, also invited a rate cut.

Strengthening of commodity prices occurred over April. Crude oil rose sharply in the first quarter of 2015, stabilising around $US52 at the end of March. Exporters of liquefied natural gas could see higher revenue as a result, as the oil price is linked with LNG production. Iron ore rose 25 per cent over April, hovering around $US60 at the end of the month.

The recent rise of the AUD, which closed at US 78 cents yesterday, contributed to the rate cut decision. The strength of the AUD resulted from relatively weak performance in the US, and quantitative easing programmes weakening the euro and the yen.

Cutting the cash rate will help to mitigate increases in the dollar, because the AUD has a lower rate of return. A strong dollar would otherwise stunt export growth, as well as demand for Australian tourism and education, which are major sources of economic growth in Queensland following divestment from mining.

The blunt nature of the interest rate as an economic stimulant means that a rate cut may contribute to further pressure on house prices

Have you ever thought about writing something down that you can hand to your kids that will help them in their property investment journey? I have.

I wish I knew at age 25 what I do now at age 45.

So I finally got around to writing that article, but you know what – it’s not a family secret and it’s worth sharing.

I’ve invested in lots of assets over the years. I’ve made good money and lost lots too (in shares FYI – never property)!

For me, successful property investing boils down to 9 key rules or “golden nuggets”, as I like to call them.

RULE #1: Pay the Right Price

This sounds simple – but in my opinion it’s not given enough consideration. The most successful property developers I know all say “you make your money when you buy the land”. That’s akin to saying “you make your money at the start of the project – by paying the right price”. This principle should apply to everyday property investors as well.

How many property investors know the complete sales history of all the units in a block of apartments before they buy the unit in that block? It’s pretty easy to find out these days – and you’re mad not too.

Websites like Onthehouse.com.au give you comparables that were once only available to valuers, now they can be accessed for anyone, and it's FREE. So knowing the worth or comparable value is key.

RULE #2: Infrastructure/Transport

Being ahead of the game in terms of future infrastructure can certainly put you ahead of the curve. There are many websites these days that focus on finding you the next area slated for public transport investment or increases in data speeds via the NBN etc.

RULE #3: Add Value

Buying a property where you can add value has always been a pretty safe bet. Again, it’s a simple tip… but some of the best returns I see are clients who do a simple makeover to a property. New kitchen from Ikea, new blinds, new carpet, new appliances and bingo

"More and more Australians are taking control of their retirement savings by establishing their own Self Managed Super Fund. SMSFs now account for the largest and fastest growing segment in the superannuation industry. 

According to the Australian Taxation Office, there were over 480,000 SMSF in June 2014, with total assets held within SMSFs valued at approximately $440 billion. This accounted for over 30% of the $1.38 trillion superannuation dollars.

The continuing growth in the number of SMSFs illustrates the important role they play for retirement saving and estate planning for many Australians.

Operating an SMSF comes with certain rules and guidelines. Each SMSF can have between one and four members, and must be operated by a single trustee or a group of trustees. Being a trustee is an important role that comes with increased responsibilities and obligations. With this in mind, the below tips provide you with a simple introductory guide to help you understand some of the key obligations.

1. Ongoing Compliance

New trustees should become educated about the compliance requirements involved with running an SMSF. All new trustees must sign a New Trustee Declaration within 21 days of becoming a trustee. The declaration contains information on general trustee duties, investment restrictions, the sole purpose test, record keeping and reporting obligations among other issues.
Trustees should aim to have good compliance procedures in place from the start and plan well to always meet deadlines.

2. Administration

The administration of SMSFs can be delegated to a professional administrator, such as The SMSF Club. New trustees need to understand that a delegation of duties isn’t a delegation of responsibilities. You are still responsible for the compliance and observing the rules relevant to your SMSF, even if you delegate your administrative tasks.

3. Recording Keeping and Reporting

Make sure you set out good reporting practices from the start. These flow on from understanding compliance, keeping up with compliance procedures and good administration. Keeping accounting records, lodging returns and forms on time, and getting a professional SMSF audit are all essential features of good reporting practice.

Good reporting practices will allow you to provide an accurate and detailed history of your fund, help you make decisions for

Figures for March 2015 show that Sydney’s median house price is now $929,000, after increasing 16.8% in the year to March.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia has announced it will hold rates for April at 2.25 percentage points.

The decision comes in a tricky economic climate for the RBA, where economic indicators remained virtually unchanged for the previous period.

The unemployment rate decreased to 6.3% in February from 6.4% in January. However this was coupled with a decrease in the participation rate from 64.7% to 64.6%, suggesting the unemployment rate fell as people came out of the labour force, rather than finding work.

Annual wage price growth was at a 5 year low in the quarter ending December 2014, at just 2.5%. The December quarter also saw low inflation, which was last recorded at 1.7%.

Iron ore is currently at a 10 year low, at $US46.7 a tonne. Iron ore is expected to fall further as competitors amplify supply to win greater market share.

Oil prices seem to be stabilising following significant decline since July 2014. Oil rose marginally in the latest trading session to $US52 per barrel. While the price is stabilising at approximately half the 5 year average, Australians may no longer enjoy further discounts in the oil price.

Though the above factors call for a further cut in the cash rate, the hold is more about timing than tightening monetary policy. This month will reveal new quarterly inflation figures and employment data, which would allow more insight into the impact of February rate cuts.

Another argument in support of holding rates is Australia’s two tiered housing market. According to Onthehouse data, at February 2015, Sydney experienced quarterly growth of 3.55% for houses, and 2.83% in units. These are down from the January quarter of 4.10% for houses and 3.04% in units, but still reflect strong investor",2021_04_23,2-May-17,N/A,RBA Leaves Rates on Hold in April
"Financial planning, investing, debt management, and knowledge and education are important considerations when getting your finances in order, and planning to set up your financial independence for later in life.

With this in mind, I have put together my Top 10 Financial Resolutions that you should put into practice this year.

Financial Planning

1: Set a Financial Goal

The first thing you need to do is to set yourself a financial goal. It should be specific and quantifiable, so you can focus on your financial priorities and know what your end goal is – what you are aiming to achieve.

Your financial goal could be anything from setting a savings target, to reducing debt or building an investment portfolio.

Related Article: My Property and Finance Wish List

2: Create a Budget

A budget is an important part of your goal setting process, and it will help you assess how realistic and achievable your financial targets are.

Your budget should be detailed and take into account all of your income and expenses. It can be used to help predict your financial future, and identify how much spare cash you’ll have to save, invest or use in other productive ways. It will also reveal if you are spending more than you are earning, and help identify ways you can close your spending gap.

Investing

3: Set an Investment Strategy

Having a clear investment strategy gives you a clear line of sight about what type of investments you are comfortable with, and those you wish stay clear of.

You also need to think about the makeup of your investment portfolio, however big or small it is. For instance, do you want to invest in one asset class like property, cash or shares, or spread your risk and invest in multiple assets?

Remember, the higher the return, the higher the risk. You should also consider your liquidity requirements. That is, do you want quick access to your cash (like that offered by savings accounts and listed shares), or are you happy to have it locked away in a less liquid investment (like property or long-term deposits)?

Related Article: Property vs Shares: Which is the Better Investment?

4: Establish a Savings Plan

Saving money is a good habit to get into. Before you know it, you can have a nice little sum of cash saved away that you can use towards achieving your financial and personal goals.

Savings are also a great form of insurance in case an unexpected event occurs – like a big ticket expense, unemployment or long term illness.

A good rule of thumb is to try and save about 3-6 months’ worth of your everyday living expenses, as buffer just in case.

For example, if you are spending $4,000 a month on food, clothing, utilities, rent/mortgage payments, you should try and save between $12,000 and $24,000 to give yourself breathing space incase the worst happens.

5: Focus on Superannuation

Take the opportunity to assess how well your super fund is performing and whether you are getting the best value for money. Compare funds, fees and products to see if you might be better off investing elsewhere.

If you have multiple funds, consider consolidating them. This will make it much easier to keep track of your money and you will only be paying one set of fees. However, make sure you get advice before rolling over any funds because your benefits may be affected and there could be transfer costs involved.

You should also take the opportunity to search for any missing superannuation accounts in your name. A good place to start doing this is online with the ATO’s Superseeker service.

Debt Management

6: Review Spending Habits

If you think you may have bad spending habits, now is the time to review them and move into more positive territory.

Bad spending habits can include things like living beyond your means, buying everything on credit (and racking up big credit or store card debt), impulse buying, and getting seduced into thinking you’re saving money when you buy things on sale – let’s be clear, whenever you buy something regardless of price, you are spending and not saving.

This is where you need to distinguish your needs – essential things like food, clothing and rent, from wants – things that are nice to have but you can do without, like expensive holidays and designer clothes.

Your budget will help you identify and cut down your spending on the things you want, and show you where you can use your cash saved for more productive purposes – like expensive debt reduction.

7: Reduce Credit Card Debt

Speaking of expensive debt, if you owe money on your credit card (or cards), aim to pay it off over the next 12 months – or sooner if possible. Interest charged on credit cards can be upwards of 20%, so it is a costly form of finance.

You should list out all your debts (e.g. credit and store cards, car and personal loans) and put together a debt reduction strategy, starting with the most expensive debt first. Once all of your debt is paid off and under control, resist the temptation to rack up more debt. Instead, spend wisely, pay cash wherever possible and cut up unnecessary cards.

8: Get a Home Loan Health Check

You should check whether your home loan is meeting your personal and financial needs about once a year. Compare and contrast your current loan’s features, flexibility and cost (interest rate and fees) to make sure you are getting the best deal. If you have borrowed to invest, check that your loan meets and supports your investment strategy and time frame.

You can research the market yourself by jumping online and visiting various home loan comparison sites, talking directly with your lender or other lenders, or appointing a mortgage broker to do the leg work for you.

Aligned with this you should also check that you have adequate insurance like home, contents, car, health and life insurance. These help protect you and your family, as well as your valuable assets. 

Knowledge and Education

9: Improve Your Financial Education

It would be wise to read widely, undertake regular research, take head of what the independent experts say and enrol in courses from reputable training organisations to understand and improve your finances. You don’t have to turn yourself into a financial expert but it is important you have a sound understanding of debt management, investing and saving.

Whilst you may not have all the answers, it is important you are able to ask the right questions and form a considered view on any advice you get.

If you have kids, start thinking about their financial education as well as yours. You are never too young to learn. And remember, you are their financial role model so make sure you teach them good habits.

10: Seek Independent Advice

There will always be times when you should, and must, seek independent advice – especially for big ticket investments and borrowing decisions. Don’t feel as though you have to go it alone.
You can get help form a variety of sources – financial planners, accountants, tax, property and legal advisers, bankers, lawyers and research firms to name a few. Make sure you use their expertise sensibly and consider their advice in line with your own knowledge and experience, as well as what feels right.

"If you’re thinking of setting up your ouw SMSF to invest in property, there are a few things you need to know to avoid some nasty surprises. 

Like several thousand Australians, I decided to jump onto the SMSF bandwagon a year ago. While I’m now better off for having done so, there were a number of things that came as a shock as I went through the process.

Here are just a few of the things experts don’t tell you or talk about when you’re considering setting up your own super.

1. It’s harder to get finance when borrowing within your SMSF.

We found this out the hard way. Having enjoyed easy access to finance with our bank, it came as a shock to us when it was time to borrow within our SMSF. The lenders need more documentsand it took a lot longer to get the loan compared to borrowing outside our SMSF.

2. You can borrow less than you think.

Even if the bank’s policy says they will lend you 80% of the property value when borrowing to buy a residential property, you may not get all that money because the total loan amount is completely tied to the yield of the property. In other words, you can’t borrow as much as you think because of the way the banks work out the servicing.

The banks use 80% of the rent and then discount it to be 1.1 times interest cover. The interest is then worked out at 2% above the interest rate.

Let’s say you want to buy a $300,000 property to be rented at $280 per week.

80% of $280 x 52 weeks = $11,648 in annual rent

$11,648 / 1.1 interest cover = $10,589

$10,589 / 6.45% + 2% = 8.45%pa = Loan amount of $125,313

So, clearly, if you want to buy a property worth $300,000 in your SMSF, you’d need to have at least $175,000 deposit in the SMSF plus be able to leave a buffer.

That’s a LVR of only 42%!

3. You need to show at least two years of super contributions if you’re self-employed.

For full-time employees like me, this is not a problem. But if you’re self-employed, you need to be able to show proof that

The Greatest Generation – born 1901-1924
The Silent Generation – born 1925-1942
Baby Boomers – born 1943 to the early 1960’s
Generation X – born early 1960’s to early 1980’s
Generation Y – born early 1980’s to the 2000’s
Generation Z – born around and after 2005

However, a new type of classification has made its way to our shores from overseas – and it has nothing to do with our birth date. Instead, it is about whether we can afford to buy residential property as an owner occupier. Those who cannot afford to do so, or those who choose not to, are aggregated into what is widely being regarded as Australia’s growing number of Generation Rent.

Housing Goals are Changing

It is no secret that first time buyers continue to get priced out of the market, and that is it getting harder and harder to get onto the property ladder as an owner-occupier. There are many reasons for this, including lack of affordability, accelerated house price growth, lack of desired supply and being unable to bridge the deposit gap.

In fact, research by Swinburne’s AHURI Research Centre indicates that around 4.5 million Australians now rent their homes, and renters range in demographic – singles, couples, families, the young and the old, so it pretty much affects everyone, everywhere. This figure is almost double to the number of renters in 1981, when the Baby Boomer’s started to enter the market.

The significance of this is what appears to be a noticeable shift in housing tenure behaviours. That is, more and more of us are renting because it’s too expensive to buy.

Related Article: Baby Boomers Reap Returns in Unaffordable Sydney Market

For instance, Swinburne’s research shows that around 600,000 of the 1.8 million in private rental accommodation have been renting for more than 10 years. That’s a long period of time to rent and may reflect, in part, the difficulty of trying to save a deposit while paying rent and meeting everyday living costs.

Furthermore, a survey of prospective first home buyers released by finder.com.au last December revealed that 1 in 3 people surveyed had chosen to rent rather than buy, despite record low interest rates. This represented a significant increase from the 1 in 10 reported in the previous survey and is a possible indicator of changes in housing aspirations.

Renting is not necessarily a dirty word

The harsh reality is, there is and will be a generation of Australians who will be permanent renters (by necessity or design), or they will buy their first home much later in life – certainly later than the Baby Boomers did.

However, this is not necessarily all doom and gloom. Yes, it is highly disappointing that many people simply cannot afford to buy their own home (the Federal and State governments need to fix this), but there are some benefits to renting that may help alleviate the disappointment of delaying home ownership, or not being able to become a home owner.

Specific benefits include:

No Mortgage Debt

One of the biggest barriers and turn-offs is the need for many borrowers, especially first time buyers, to borrow at or beyond their comfort levels. Apart from signing a lease and paying a bond, there is no long term financial commitment.

Affordability

More often than not, it is cheaper to rent than buy – with buying including saving a deposit, paying legal fees and stamp duty, and of course paying ongoing mortgage payments.
With this removed, there’s less stress on finances, and with less net income devoted to housing costs there’s more money left over to spend, save or invest.

Greater Flexibility

Buying means committing to an area for a minimum period of time, usually 5 to 7 years if you are looking for capital growth. If you sell early, you may end up being worse off if prices don’t move and you take into account your purchase and selling costs.

On the other hand, it is much easier for renters to move due to career changes, to get a better home or location, and to perhaps even get cheaper rent.

You can also move into areas you can’t afford to buy into – like inner city areas or other popular suburbs.

Less Risk

Home owners are exposed to financial risks like interest rate hikes, negative equity, repossession, capital loss, default and adverse credit reporting.

As a renter, the most you’re likely to lose is your bond, although you must ensure you make your rent payments on time each month as this is something future landlords will be looking for.

No Maintenance Costs

When you are renting, repairs and maintenance is your landlord’s responsibility.

Landlords are also responsible for council rates and taxes, and building insurance. As a renter, you are required to pay your rent and other utilities like water, gas, electricity and telephone, as well as insurance if you want to cover your own belongings.

So despite what you might read in the press, it’s not all bad news when it comes to renting. It might not be everybody’s end goal, but there are positives that come from being a renter – the main one being able to afford to put a roof over your head.

However, to make renting more appealing and more equitable form a social perspective, and to help alleviate some of the downsides of renting, the laws protecting tenants could do with a bit of tightening up. This is especially so around things like lease terms, the ability for tenants to make minor alterations, keeping pets and the issue of eviction notices.

In other words, addressing these problem areas would help provide tenants with better lease tenures and encourage them (or better still, require them), to take as much care of their rented property is if it was their own. That way, everybody wins.

"Sydney is buzzing with rail construction worth billions. By 2019 the North Western suburbs of Sydney will have a rail line connecting them to Chatswood. An Eastern Suburbs light rail will be completed in 2019.

As you look for the next best growth opportunities around Sydney, we share three vital pieces of information for buying around a suburb with a train station, and some of the research findings will surprise you!

Related Article: Sydney Market Continues to Boom Despite Potential Oversupply

1. Suburbs With Stations Do Better Than Suburbs Without

Rail infrastructure generally lifts the value of properties in a suburb. In the City of Blacktown Council for example, suburbs with train stations have median house prices that around 3.7% higher than those without. In my analysis of major stations, I found that these suburbs generally had higher capital growth rates than the 10 year average for the Sydney region.

Train stations are often located within commercial hubs, and give people cheap, easy access to work and leisure. So, if you are looking to achieve relatively strong growth on an investment or family home, it may be best to buy near a station.

2. Save Yourself the Money: It Does Not Matter Where in the Suburb You Buy

Being in a suburb with a train station is a plus for house values. But do properties right next to a station have higher or lower growth rates and rental yields to those a few kilometres away?

In short: No.

Four well known train stations in Sydney - Blacktown, Sutherland, Lidcombe and Mascot - have been analysed. For each of station, I considered the median capital growth rates of properties less than 1 km away, 1-5 kms away and 5-10 kms away.

There was no significant difference in growth rates for properties that were 1 km, 5 kms or 10 kms away from a train station. However, there were some weak, observable trends.

The growth and trends for the different radius distances of properties are presented below[1].

"The ‘Magic’ Formula for Spotting the Next Growth Areas

Property investors have been known to obsess about the next hotspots, and for good reason.

Hotspots, if you time your entry very well, can see property values grow strongly within a short period of time. This enables you to amass equity quickly and use that to build your portfolio.

Unfortunately, hotspots have been associated with far-flung areas generally linked with the mining industry.

Sceptics have also dismissed hotspot lists because they think that, by the time you hear about them, hotspots have already gone up in value and you’re buying at the peak.

However, it can also be argued that people are not always that quick to make investment decisions. When they hear about a hotspot, they may look into it but do nothing until they see evidence that others are already buying in the area.

How to identify areas about to see a growth spurt

Identifying the next boom areas has become an ultra-competitive sport in the property arena. Everyone has their methods of finding which areas are going to see housing price growth.

Here are a few tips on how to find areas that are set to grow in value.

1. Look for areas that are experiencing gentrification.

These areas tend to have a bad reputation but are now seeing homeowners moving in and changing the landscape of the suburb.

"As our ageing population threatens Australian society with unsustainable debt, it is time to ask the question: How can we help people live independently in retirement so they are less reliant on the government pension?

It is clear that we need to come up with a solution to this looming problem. Unless we find ways for retirees to live independently, there is a real risk that the standard of living for the aged, and for all of us in general, will reduce. The government simply can’t keep spending more than it receives forever, that is – unless we want to see ourselves in a situation like Greece.

This article explores superannuation guidelines (with reference to the family home) that could incentivise greater independence from government support among retirees.

In most cases, the family home is the largest valued asset held by many retired people. More often than not, it will not be fully utilised and in reality, most retired people do not need the space it provides. If you can afford to live without any financial help, then by all means continue to live in and enjoy your family home where you have spent most of your life. However, if you struggle to afford to stay in your home, and need government assistance in order to remain living there, then rational economics suggest it may be time to sell and move into a home that is more in accordance with your financial position.

You may find my statement harsh, but it is the reality and what we would all have to do if the government wasn’t there to support us in our old age.

Notwithstanding the economic rationalism, it is very difficult to make a social and political change and remove something that has been in place for many years. For decades, people have planned for retirement based on the assumption that they would never have to sell their home. They paid taxes, and accepted those taxes on the basis that the government would support them in old age and never have regard for the value of the family home.

Yet the reality is that we can’t continue this way. We have to find a solution – something that will help retirees be independent of government support and still enjoy a comfortable lifestyle in retirement.

So, for what it is worth, here is my proposal on what I believe Government should do:

Include the value of the family home in the means test when identifying the right to any pension or part thereof. The value of the family home included should be an amount that exceeds say $400,000.
Allow any person to contribute up to $2 million into their super fund where such funds are generated from the sale of the family home and the person is over the age of 60 years.
The ability to contribute to the super fund should be a one-off entitlement and have no tests other than those in the above point. It should be allowed, even where the person is receiving a pension from their super fund.

Currently, there is a significant amount of discussion around the right of people to contribute more than is realistically needed into their super simply for estate planning purposes. That discussion is soundly based given the large cost this potentially has on tax revenue when the government is struggling to reduce debt and balance the budget. In reality, even if we retire at 60 years of age, most of us don’t need to support ourselves for more than about another 30 years.

So how much do we really need in our super fund?

If we assume an inflation rate of about 2%, and we are happy that we can comfortably live on $70,000 per year after tax, then we would need to have a fund of approximately $2.06 million today. This assumes our fund has a growth rate equal to the inflation rate only. Clearly, our fund should be able to do better than this.

On the above basis, it appears reasonable that the government should place a limit on the size of the tax-free status in a super fund to something in the order of $2.5 million.

Given all of the above, it seems to me that a reasonable and acceptable solution is to encourage retirees to downsize their home and at the same time alter the super fund rules so funds have a limit of $2.5 million. People downsizing should also be allowed to make a

"New research from Onthehouse.com.au has revealed the top 10 investor suburbs set to deliver in 2015.

The data revealed that nine out of the 10 top investment areas, when considering projected growth and rental yield, are located along the regional coast of New South Wales and Queensland, while the remaining suburb is located in Western Australia.

The below table lists the top 10 suburbs, in ranking order. 

Relative affordability of quiet coastal suburbs makes them ideal locations for retirees or young families.

A perfect example of this is Morisset, which is ideally located on the shore of Lake Macquarie as well as being a short drive from the beach - and during the last Census it was found that 39% of the suburb's population was aged 65 years or over. Many young health professionals have also found the area to be extremely affordable and a good place to rent and save while they attain work experience in the health sector.

With the majority of suburbs featuring on the list projecting growth in houses, Byron Bay stood out indicating strong growth in units.

Suburbs such as Byron Bay have become a popular and affordable seasonal destination for young people. It has a mild climate all year round and a trendy culture that attracts people to reside in the area, even outside of the holiday season.

Due to continued rising levels of unaffordability in major cities, regional areas have become more enticing for businesses, as well as home owners.

Businesses have found it cheaper to relocate their manufacturing and processing outside of metro city areas, creating jobs in regional areas.

This is again evidenced around Morisset, but is also a case for the outer Perth suburb of Stratton, which is located just 20 km from the Perth CBD. The median value in Stratton is more than $160,000 cheaper than the city area of Perth.

Queensland’s Allenstown was the most affordable on the list with a median home value of $267,500.

In Queensland, a prominent trend is the use of Government-led infrastructure programs to boost construction employment. In many areas, this will help to absorb unemployment in the mining industry as construction here reaches an end.

The trend with all of these areas is that they are either regional, or located outside their relevant capital city. This suggests that limited affordability in capital cities is crowding out investors and tenants. People are choosing to live in regional hot spots where employment is growing and the lifestyle is affordable, spacious and near the water.

"Hockey Orders Sale of Point Piper Mansion for FIRB Breach

The federal government will consider laying criminal charges against one of China's richest men after discovering his company – Golden Fast Foods, illegally purchased Point Piper mansion ‘Villa de Mare’ for $39 million.

Treasurer Joe Hockey announced yesterday that Golden Fast Foods now had 90 days to sell the Point Piper property, which it bought through LJ Hooker Double Bay in November last year.

The property was bought illegally by Golden Fast Foods – which is ultimately owned by Evergrande Real Estate Group, a large company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange – via a string of shell companies, including in Australia, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands,” Mr Hockey said.

Under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, foreign investors must notify the treasurer through the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) before purchasing residential real estate. Golden Fast Foods is a foreign-owned company which failed to notify FIRB of its intended purchase.

Mr Hockey said he made the divestment order following advice from the Australian government solicitor.

Golden Fast Foods has 90 days to dispose of the property or the matter may be referred to the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions, Mr Hockey said.

We welcome all foreign investment that is not contrary to our national interest, he said.

Under Australia’s foreign investment policy, foreign investment should increase Australia’s housing stock.

"Property vs Shares:
Which is the Better Investment?

You may have heard the term ‘as safe as houses’ when it comes to investing - however, as the appealing Australian lifestyle has drawn more investment to our housing market, people view dwellings more as portfolio assets than buildings to live in. As a result, Australian housing markets have seen higher volatility and lower rental returns. Between June 2005 and June 2014 alone, the average house in Sydney provided returns between -1.00% and 20%.

Higher risk surrounding Australian houses and units made us wonder: Are houses and units still the safest investment?

This report compares the amount of risk and the amount of money to be made on houses, units and shares. The report explains three surprising pieces of information:

1. Houses and Units Do Not Always Provide the Best Return

Shares tend to provide higher returns, at less risk, within a shorter period of time. Houses and units provide higher return in the long run. The report reveals the amount of time needed to hold houses and units in order for them to outperform the ALLORDS.

2. The Rules are Different for Houses and Shares

People are able to borrow much more against property (up to 90%) than against shares (up to 50%). This is because shares are perceived as more risky. However, as dwellings become more volatile, these levels of borrowing may be subject to review. The report reveals the effect that specific levels of borrowing have on risk and return for houses, units and shares.

3. The Rules of the Game are Changing

Excessive investment in Australian dwellings have spurred policy makes to review tax benefits associated with housing, in order to relieve pressure on the market. Assets in the full report are considered under possible changes to legislation around the Capital Gains Tax and Negative Gearing. The report shows the full impact of changes to policy.

"Part 3: A Tax Solution to Negative Gearing Issues

It needs to be recognised that excessive investment activity does impact on prices as demand is increased. Consequently, first home buyers and others with limited cash resources are excluded from the market. The unit market is predominately the place of the investor, while investment activity in the house and land market is limited. It is difficult to identify the impact of investors on the market. Given their increased activity in the unit market it is probably reasonable to assume that at least 30% of the growth can be attributed to investor activity (this is the share of the market that is generally recognised as being rented).

This suggests that, in the year to September 2014, investors caused unit prices to increase by approximately $21,000. This is a very significant amount in the eyes of the young first home buyer and probably more than they could save in two years.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has outlined a range of new fees and penalties that would make life harder for foreign real estate investors – and potentially agents.

The federal government has asked the public to comment on a new options paper, which has proposed to increase compliance on investors, developers and third parties such as agents.

Related Article: Hockey Orders Sale of Point Piper Mansion for FIRB Breach

This would be done by creating a specialised investigative and enforcement area within the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

The ATO would be tasked with “using its sophisticated data matching systems to detect instances of potential non-compliance with the foreign investment rules”.

It would draw on land titles data from the states and territories, its own taxpayer information, foreign investment approvals data and immigration movements data.

The government also wants to amend legislation to make it easier for agencies to share data.

All this would impose increased costs on the government, which would be partially offset by introducing application fees on foreign investment proposals.

The government has also proposed a range of penalties for those who breach foreign investment rules, which largely limits overseas buyers to new properties.

Data to December 2014 show mixed results across the nation, with Sydney being the only market to do really well in last 12 months. The median value of Sydney houses and units grew by 16.78% and 12.90% respectively in the year to December 2014, while other markets failed to keep pace with inflation.

Related Article: Sydney Market Reaches Boom Conditions

Falling oil prices and the lower Australian dollar should have been sufficient to stimulate demand in the Australian economy. Leaving rates on hold would have allowed the time to see if this was true and the RBA could have kept a rate cut for future use if needed.

A recent analysis of the latest property data indicates mixed performance results across the country, but what is clear is the fact that the Sydney market has reached boom conditions. There is also a potential stock overhang, which may be at significant levels in some state markets.

Now that interest rates have decreased, we can anticipate that house prices will move forward from here notwithstanding the fact that all state markets were showing a slowing in growth. In short, the interest rate decision will likely stimulate the market but the lending control of the major banks should ensure the market doesn’t overheat to any significant extent.

So, is a cut in interest rates a good outcome? The simple answer is NO!

While the cut is good for existing home owners in the short term, this may not be the case over the long term.

1. Get a decent return on your savings.

"Are you looking to buy a property but keep getting out-bid at auction or out-negotiated during private treaty sales?

This is happening to many home buyers and investors, particularly first time buyers. It is a frustrating and is sometimes a repetitive process that can often leave buyers disheartened and on the verge of giving up on finding their next home or investment. So, this brings about the question – how do you beat the competition when buying a home?

There seems to be 3 possible answers:

1. Live with the constant frustration and disappointment of missing out.
2. Give up, or
3. Secure the sale before your competition knows about it.

The first two options aren’t particularly palatable, so let me give you some advice on option number 3.

In order to beat the completion, many buyers are now actively trying to buy property before it makes it onto the internet and into the brochures of selling agents. This is particularly the case in popular areas where supply is not keeping up with demand.

With more and more sales now being made behind closed doors without the knowledge of the wider market, there are a number of

"There has been a lot of press over the past year or so about foreign buyers snapping up large portions of the Australian residential property market. In particular, concerns have been expressed that foreign buyers are willing and able to pay above market values in popular areas as many are cash buyers, or can contribute significant deposits, and are therefore not constrained by lenders’ valuation and loan-to-value restrictions.

It is argued that this has had the effect of inflating prices beyond the norm, which has resulted in many local buyers being priced out of the market – especially first time buyers.

Is this really the case? Are local buyers really being priced out of the property market by foreigners?

By the Numbers

It is hard to put a precise figure on the exact number of foreign buyers snapping up Australian residential property as there is currently no reliable source on foreign property transactions.
There has been frequent anecdotal comments by selling agents on the matter, particularly in popular suburbs in the eastern states, however there is no national data base that can unequivocally provide details on exactly how many overseas buyers are buying, and what type of properties they are seeking.

"Buying an investment property through a SMSF is different to buying property in your own name. There are special laws that need to be complied with, lending requirements are different, there are more legal costs and the choice of property can also be different. Given this, there are a number of mistakes or omissions that many people make when purchasing property through their SMSF. 

Here are the top 6 mistakes made by SMSF property investors…

1. Location

The location of a property influences rental returns, which can be an important factor for meeting loan repayments. However, it is very dangerous to purchase a property in an area that is reliant on one industry alone for its future growth. Doing so put you at great risk of future losses as the collapse of the industry would severely impact property prices and rental returns.

Take Western Australia for example. Investment properties in mining areas have made some excellent returns in the recent past. However, areas that are reliant on one industry – let’s say iron ore – are at high risk of loss if the industry is affected or shut down. If the price of iron ore collapses, or exports to places like China drops off, the growth prospects for properties in the area is severely impacted and finding tenants would become near impossible. This could result in the loan not being serviced and the property would need to be sold – which could be at a loss given the decline of the sole industry in the town.

The move takes the cash rate down to 2.25%, a record low since the Reserve Bank gained independence and started targeting inflation in the 1990s.

While most experts predicted a rate cut in 2015, the cut has come earlier than most anticipated. Economists still agree a further reduction in rates is likely this year.

The Bank’s decision reflects concerns over deteriorating economic activity clearly evident over the past six months. Lower interest rates have been implemented to stimulate a weak economy and restore consumer confidence.

A computer model, developed by Residex, identified the rate of total return from a particular asset, given the removal of negative gearing. This after tax return is adjusted for inflation. The model also identifies the risk associated with each asset. ‘Risk’ is the probability that the real return will be lower than inflation. Other models were also constructed where the risk was assessed on the variability in the return. The outcomes from the models pointed to similar findings.

"Part 1: Don’t Believe the Hype

Abnormally high property prices, and the dramatic decrease of affordability in Australian housing markets, are spurring reactions. Negative gearing tax benefits, in drawing housing asset investors into the property market, is perceived to be crowding out first home buyers.

Anyone who can guess how investors would react to the loss of a tax break can assume that removing negative gearing would pull some investors out of the property market. This could relieve pressure on purchases and lower house prices. Many would see this as welcome.

However, there is an unintended consequence of a reduction in the amount of investment properties purchased: It could worsen the living standards of renters by causing dollar weekly rents to increase.

This would be the case if enough investors pulled out of property investing, limiting the supply of dwellings available for rent. Further, rental rates could be subject to increase as investors increased the rentals in an attempt to maintain rates of return.

The only way we can understand the likely impact is to model the investment with and without negative gearing using actual data that obtained over the past decades. Residex has this data and has developed the required models to show just what would happen if negative gearing was removed.

The analysis shows that that the provision of negative gearing is still necessary but its analysis shows that excessive gearing carries significant risk in both return and tax terms. In this report we

A year is a very long time in the property market. It’s fair to say the market has gone gangbusters in 2014, compared to the same period in 2013. Onthehouse.com.au figures revealed that national residential property sales are just shy of the 500,000 mark.

As Table 1 demonstrates, total national sales reached 494,991 – a 12.7% increase from the previous year.

Table 1: House and Unit Sales

This increase was underpinned by strength in both the house and unit markets, with annual sales in each market closing at 340,197 (up 13.9% in the last year) and 154,794 (up 10.1% in the last year) respectively.

A common myth in the Superannuation Industry is that you should have a super balance of at least $200,000 prior to establishing a Self-Managed Super Fund. This is no longer the case.

Younger Australians with smaller super balances now have the opportunity to take control of their investment decisions inside of super, without having a large super balance or being hit with high management fees.

Younger people need to understand the importance of taking superannuation seriously, so they can begin to set up their future and have more money in retirement.

But what’s in store for 2015?

Will the property price growth of 2014 continue this year, or will the market behave differently in 2015? To get a sense of where prices are headed, let’s take a look at some of the key drivers in the market and how they might affect price growth over the next 12 months.

1. Interest Rates

The cost and availability of home and investor loan finance is a key driver in the market. In 2014, this was at historically low levels with no Cash Rate movement throughout the year – the Cash Rate has remained on hold at 2.5 per cent since August 2013.

The decision to keep the cash rate on hold was widely anticipated by financial and property experts, and reiterates that its current settings were right for fostering sustainable growth.

However, governor Glenn Stevens warned that growth in both Europe and Japan was weak, and that key commodity prices had ""declined significantly"" due to a mismatch between supply and demand. This was the main deviation from last month's statement.

The present lending market is ideal for investors – low interest rates and considerable competition among lenders, especially the non-bank lenders. So there is no shortage of options when it comes to investment property loans.

Published: 19 November, 2014.",2021_04_23,2-May-17,N/A,VIDEO: What Hotspots Should We Consider?
"I have often spoke about Australia having a two-speed economy, referring to the significant economic activity in the resource states compared to the sluggish performance in non-resource states over the past few years. Today, however, there is a deeper divide developing and it is not in general economic activities – it is in the housing markets.

Table 1 provide the market update for statistics up to October 2014. The data clearly displays very strong growth in Sydney and the significant price differences between markets.

Table 1

Sydney has been one of the most expensive markets since the early 1970s, and in recent times it has by far become the most unaffordable city in the nation – currently, the median household is left with just over $750 per week (after tax) after making home loan repayments on the median house. This is an unacceptable position by any measure. While the unit market provides a better position financially, it still breaches the comfortable commitment level for the median household, and only improves things by about $300 per week.

Normally, the alternative to avoid overextending yourself to buy a home is renting, however this is also approaching an unaffordable level in the Sydney market. The after tax cash benefit of the median family renting the median home is only about $300 per week better than paying off a mortgage, while the unit market provides a much worse position with the benefit being less than $100 per week more. 

Clearly, something has to give. The counterbalance to any profound, long term economic change in the environment is historically low interest rates. The current low interest rate setting has come at a time where there is uncertainty in the market with respect to the security of share investments and the increasing need of ‘baby boomers’ to grow their retirement funds so they can live comfortably in the future.

Related Article: Interest Rate Decision

The one asset ‘baby boomers’ have seen a constant return from, without too much disruption, is the family home. The current position in the housing market is terrific for baby boomers, with returns being very attractive in recent times. To understand the strong leaning to property investment by this group of investors, consider this:

A typical baby boomer who purchased their home in Sydney in 1975 would have paid around $27,000. Today, their home would be worth around $875,000. The return over this period is better than 9.3% per annum – it would be exceptionally difficult to find an asset that has performed better than this better on an after tax basis.

Given the above, it comes as no surprise that baby boomers are strongly motivated to grow their wealth and encourage others to do the same by investing in residential property. What else can we expect in a situation where there is little return from making bank deposits or buying bonds? Additionally, while the stock market has been doing relatively well recently, most baby boomers will have had some very salutary lessons delivered by the GFC from investing in shares.

The growth in wealth by baby boomers has given them added power in terms of their capacity to borrow more to further their wealth generation process. Furthermore, the changes to superannuation, which now allows borrowings, is also leading this group into aggressive investment activity in the residential marketplace.

What we have learnt from experience is, where there is ample opportunity or limited constraint on people’s capacity to borrow and buy, property values will be bid up beyond real value. This is what is happening currently. Baby boomer investors currently have limited constraints on accessing funds due to the large level of equity most of them have in their family home.

The constraint that should be there – you cannot negatively gear a property for its full period of investment – is being voided because many are unaware of the restrictions that exist when negative gearing. Equally, bankers and financial advisors are not urging people who want investment loans to obtain detailed taxation advice. Investors have to be able to, on reasonable basis, demonstrate that there is a likelihood of the investment returning taxable income over a reasonable investment period. In most cases, for the investor to be able to do this in the current environment where interest rates are at historical lows, they would need to have a substantial deposit (probably better than 10%).

The position is not helped by the government’s failing to provide adequate resources in the Australian Taxation Office to pursue those who are failing to comply with the requirements of the taxation legislation. This issue is significant as there is probably more than $20 billion in tax deductions being claimed annually as a result of negative gearing. This will ultimately cause the government to take some type of action, but what we don’t want is the removal of negative gearing all together for a vast number of reasons.

The possible outcome for investors who claim negative gearing deductions where there is no reasonable chance of their investment providing taxable profits from rental income are:

The Commissioner denies all deductions and levies fines, based on the claim that you were engaged in tax avoidance. He can claim that without tax deductions, you would not have entered into the transaction.
Alternatively, the Commissioner could run the case that as you were never going to make any profits from the transaction, other than from the sale of the property, you were in the business of trading in residential property. In this situation, your ability to claim the concessional capital gains tax benefits can only be subjected to tax with respect to 50% of the capital gain that would be lost.

To this point, one can probably assume that the Commissioner has not followed the above path; the task of looking at all investors’ tax returns would be very significant, and the return on the effort could be judged as not being worthwhile. At least this probably was the case. However, as the number of people involved in residential property investment has now grown significantly, the benefit will not be so little. Given this situation, we should all take note and make sure we understand the tax risks we may be taking.

I believe it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to issue a general tax guideline or ruling so everyone can understand the complexity of negative gearing and the rules that people need to comply with to ensure that every-day people are not unintentionally breaking the law. Most every-day people I speak to simply believe there are no rules and that they can simply borrow as much as they like and negatively gear a property for the full term of their investment.

If the current position continued, it could ultimately result in the removal of negative gearing, which would be inappropriate and not in the best interests of the Australian economy. This would cause another unnecessary distorting piece of legislation related to the housing market.

Until Next month,

Investors should be leveraging building inspectors to get better outcomes in their purchasing decisions and to reduce the risks of property investment.

Here are the top 5 top tips to ensure you get the most of your building inspections:

1. Use the building inspection report to negotiate the best price for your next investment.

Review the pre-purchase building inspection report on any property you are considering purchasing as an investment and leverage the identified defects to negotiate savings.
Alternatively you may negotiate to have repairs done before the property settles.

In some situations you may be able to withdraw from a sale due to major defect identification.

2. Inform your purchase decision.

Are you investing to renovate and sell the property? If so, you need to know if the problems are simply cosmetic and superficial or structural and costly.

Whether it’s a wall you’re planning on knocking out to create an open plan living room or a bit of spit and polish, don’t be undone by the discovery of termite damage or more, which can derail your renovation budget.



3. Protect your tenants.

Faulty smoke alarms, dodgy decks or pool fences and the potential presence of asbestos are all risks for your tenants.

Investors, who own property and rent it, expose themselves to a wide array of liability and simply engaging an estate agent will not absolve you of all responsibility.

You can use a building inspection report to evidence your diligent management of the property.



4. Monitor your builder and trades.

Position yourself to negotiate with trades and ensure corners aren’t cut if you are about to renovate your investment property or start a property development project.

Surveyors and certifiers are only checking to see whether the property is safe to occupy by meeting the Building Code of Australia.

The vast majority of disputes which occur in building projects relate to the standard of workmanship and whether what was specified was delivered.



5. Check you’re off the plan purchase.

Creep in off the plan apartment purchases occasionally occurs when space is ‘stolen’ by modifications and amendments throughout construction.

Especially critical if you are an overseas or interstate investor a building inspection can ensure your purchase has not been affected by creep before you make your final payment.


 

Building inspection services are also tax deductible for investors.

"The increasing popularity in SMSFs over recent years has caused the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to increase its compliance focus on trustees of SMSFs.

As SMSF’s offer tax advantages to encourage people to save for their retirement (15% tax on income), it is imperative that trustees comply with superannuation law and regulatory requirements. If trustees contravene or breach the rules, consequences could include making the SMSF non-compliant, civil and criminal penalties with fines up to $200,000, and/or imprisonment.

Exceeding Contributions Caps

Excess contributions can be taxed at a total rate of 93% if you exceed both the concessional and non-concessional contributions caps in a financial year.
For example:

Any contributions over the concessional cap are taxed at a rate of 31.5%, plus the initial 15% income tax paid by the SMSF. This equates to 46.5%.
Excess concessional contributions are counted towards the member’s non-concessional contributions.
If a member also exceeds the non-concessional contributions cap, contributions over the cap are taxed at a rate of 46.5%.
This means that contributions over the concessional cap that causes a member to exceed the non-concessional cap will be taxed at 93% - that is: 31.5% excess concessional contributions tax, plus 15% income tax, plus 46.5% excess non-concessional contributions tax.

As you can see, it is imperative that your contributions stay within

"Property investments can make you money in two ways:

Through generating an annual cash return from the investment (rental income less holding and operating costs).
Through the capital appreciation you receive when the property is sold and a capital profit is made.

Most property investors make their money at the time of sale, many years down the track. As a lot of properties are negatively geared, investors are required to pay the gap in any shortfalls in property expenses until the property is sold, making the property cash flow negative. Even on an after-tax basis, this can be a burden for the average investor.

A trap many investors fall into is that they predominantly look at the end position and forget to focus attention on the here and now. That is, they put all their eggs in one basket (focusing on capital gains) and don’t look at ways to reduce their negative gearing burden – or for the luck investor, further improve their positive gearing position.

There are two key strategies investors can adopt to help generate superior ongoing cash returns:

"At its October meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia announced that the official cash rate will remain on hold at 2.5 per cent, extending its longest period of stability. Interest rates have remained at a record low since August 2013. 

Reserve bank governor Glenn Stevens said: “On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.”

Mr Stevens said growth was expected to stay below trend over the next several quarters.

1. Is now the right time to sell?
2. Is it a Good Time to Buy an Investment or Keep Your Money in the Bank?
3. What Housing Bubble?

There may come a time in your life when you have to (or choose to) relocate, whether it be for professional or personal reasons, and you are faced with the decision on what to do with your family home. Should you sell? Or should you retain it and rent it out? 

People are most often left with this decision if they need to relocate for a job opportunity, or because they’ve decided to take an extended vacation. Whatever the reason may be, they are left with a tough choice on what to do with their current home, with some big financial and emotional ramifications.

Many years ago, my wife and I decided to travel overseas for a couple of years and we faced this very scenario – rent or sell.

We decided to sell because we had built up good equity in our property, we needed some capital to fund our adventure and we weren’t really sure when we would be back or if we wanted to return to the same property.

In the end, we spent 12 years in the UK and when we returned we found a bigger home (because our family had grown while we were away) in a different suburb. Plus, we used the proceeds from selling our Australian home to fund our new home overseas.

For us, this worked out really well. However, because everyone’s circumstances are different, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.

With this in mind here, I’ve put together my top 10 key considerations to help you make the best decision for you, when it comes to choosing between renting and selling your family home.

Top 10 Considerations
Which option makes the most sense financially?
Cash is king in these situations and you need to work out what you can and can’t afford.

Start by preparing a detailed budget, covering the period you will be away. Your budget should account for all income and expenses associated with renting out your home, together with the costs associated to renting or buying your ‘new’ home. Once this has been done, prepare a similar budget that assumes your property was sold.

This will quickly show you which option is the more financially feasible one for your circumstances, which may reveal the best course of action.


What can you handle emotionally?
Selling your family home can be quite an emotional experience. You’ve built a life in this home and with this you have some wonderful memories. On the flip side, it can be equally tough renting your home out to a total stranger. Property investors are usually objective and detach emotion from the property they’re renting out, otherwise mistakes can be made and financial returns adversely affected.

Of course, if you’re planning to come back to this home in the future, then the strategy of renting out your home might focus on maintaining your asset and earning some cash to cover the holding costs while you’re away, rather than maximising investment returns.

Tip: If you think you’ll have major emotional problems with renting your home out to a stranger, selling the property might be the best option.
 
Is there is the rental demand for your property?
Before putting your home on the rental market, you need to do some research. Find out what the rental demand is in your area and see what the average rent level is. This is an important part of your budgeting process.

If rental demand is low and/or vacancy rates are high in your area, that’s not good from a financial or a security perspective – you don’t want your property sitting vacant for extended periods of time as it could be the target of vandalism and theft.

Tip: Talk to a couple of local estate agents to get some rental advice, and visit Onthehouse.com.au to check rental yields in your street and suburb.

2. What Housing Bubble?
3. Get the best price for your investment property

The arrival of spring signals the beginning of renewal and growth. It is also the start of the busiest time in the property market, where buyers and sellers are out in force. This is especially the case for the period between the 1st September and Christmas, when the property market hits its peak.

As more properties come on the market, competition increases as buyers have more choice and can be more selective in what they will and won’t buy. So, to help you achieve a successful spring sale, here are my top 5 tips to help your property stand out from the crowd…

1. Focus on street appeal

First impressions mean a lot in the property market, especially the view from the street. Curb appeal can make or break a property – if there isn’t any, it can stop potential buyers from even walking through the front gate.

This is why your home has to be inviting and reflect a place that is well loved and looks in a near new condition. Make sure the front fence and gate is in good repair, the front garden is neat, tidy and free of clutter, and the front of the house is clean and in a good state of repair – apply a lick of paint if need be.

Tip: Don’t forget to move garbage bins out of sight and to clean out your gutters.

2. Be up to date with maintenance work

Make sure all the little repair jobs have been taken care of. Obvious maintenance work needs to be a priority so buyers focus on the positives, not the negatives. Things like cracked tiles, leaking taps, windows that don’t open and close properly, and blinds that don’t work are examples of defects that are usually easy and cheap to fix.

Tip: Conduct a thorough inspection of your property and make a list of all the things that need doing. Make sure you’ve made all the repairs before your first opening.

3. Showcase outdoor areas

Outdoor areas can be a big differentiating factor. Most Australians love outdoor living, so no matter how small or large your garden or patio area is, make sure potential buyers can see themselves enjoying a BBQ, family gatherings or just relaxing in a welcoming, functional and aesthetically pleasing space. Cost effective garden makeovers can also pay dividends, and you can develop wasted areas into useful secluded spaces.

Tip: Quality outdoor furniture can lift the appeal of back and front gardens and help buyers better appreciate what you property offers in the way of outdoor living.

1. Are Gen Ys Not Taking Super Seriously?
2. Individual Trustee vs. Corporate Trustee?
3. Top tips for SMSF trustees

Earlier this month, the Abbott Government reached a deal with the Palmer United Party (PUP) on the removal of the mining tax.

While this is great news on the surface, not everything is as good as it appears.

As part of the new deal, workers across the country will lose seven years of promised superannuation increases as compulsory contributions from employers will remain at 9.5% until July 2021. The contribution rate will then rise to 10% and increase at half a percentage point every year until it hits its 12% target.

So, what does this mean for you?

The freeze in super contributions will affect every Australian who earns (or will earn) an income. Industry Super Australia estimates that the change will have a great effect on retirement savings. For an average income earner aged 25, the delay in the super guarantee will cost them around $100,000 over their working life ($36,000 in today’s dollars).

For those of you who are closer to retirement, the outcome is still not positive as once again less of your income will go into your retirement savings.

Another decision made was the extension of the low income superannuation contribution scheme until 30 June 2017.

The low income super contribution gives up to $500 a year to help those earning $37,000 or less to save for their retirement. The initiative was created to ensure all Australian’s paid no more tax for superannuation contributions other than on their marginal income. The Government rebates the 15% contribution tax paid for low income earners. The extension of the low income super contribution is great news for many Australians.

1. Property vs. Shares: Which is the better investment?
2. Attention: The media is harming the economy!

There are widespread reports in the media about a house price bubble – particularly in Sydney. But, does a bubble actually exist?

In many respects, this question is one of definition – What characterises a “bubble” and when do they occur?

In my view, a market bubble exists when there is very significant growth in asset values and that value growth is driven by borrowings. In more general terms, it is driven by greed and lack of careful thought by both lenders and borrowers. It is excessive bank lending that allows leverage and the willingness of borrowers to pay unreasonable prices for property.

So, is there a bubble situation currently? Well, there is nothing that suggests we are in a bubble environment as far as our housing markets are currently concerned. Poor affordability in many of our markets (mainly Sydney and Melbourne) is the likely cause of the house price bubble talk we keep hearing in the media. However, what people are failing to recognise is the market has changed –the type of buyers now in the market are different.

Current buyers are no longer median income families, they are second and third time home buyers with income levels that go far beyond the median household income. The driving force behind the growth in property values seems to be these existing homeowners who have reasonable levels of income and assets to support their property purchases – purchases which are often investments.

While banks and financial intermediaries are becoming a little more aggressive in working to maintain market share, their risk management policies are acceptable. In the situation where current buyers are existing homeowners, lenders can be more aggressive due to the borrower’s provision of greater levels of security, probable better capacity to meet their obligations due to rental receipts and a probable better wage income position. While future increases in interest rates could potentially cause problems, for this group of people its impact will be lessened due to the tax deductibility of interest. If interest rates increase by 1% for example, the impact on investors would be far less than homebuyers as the increase for those on the marginal tax rate is around 0.5%.

1. John Edwards on Switzer TV
2. Sydney market continues to show growth

Forget the housing bubble bull dust being spread by the media. Journalists continue to publish negative stories because you, the reader, seem to be far more interested in bad news. If you loved positive stories, the media would give them to you. 

All of us are over-influenced by headlines in the media, but they only give a small part of the story. Because you, (the reader) are programmed for negativity, headlines are always the bad bit.

Recently on my show I had property expert John Edwards – Consultant to Onthehosue.com.au and Founder of Residex, on the show (click here to see the video). No one knows more about Australian property prices so I asked him to verify if a housing bubble is a real threat. From what Edwards said, the front page headlines that printed bubble fear stories should be something truthful such as:

“We were WRONG on housing bubble — expert says!”

If admitting a mistake is too hard for these media outlets, then maybe they could simply run with this: “Expert says No Housing Bubble!”
In the absence of a big story out of Wall Street, I started to think about the run of economic data this week and how it affected my Sky News colleague Stan Grant, who I do a finance cross with each night.

As Stan put it: “Business confidence was down yesterday and now consumer confidence is down and so is the dollar — things seem to be going to the negative when it looked more positive.”
Stan was referring to the run of data until very recently, which was largely promising. However there has been a softening of the economic readings and that became a little worrying a month ago when unemployment spiked from 6% to 6.4% cent in July.

Now economists have doubted the statistical reliability of that number and hopefully today’s unemployment figure will right the wrongs of that July shock. If it doesn’t, we’ll have to brace ourselves for another dose of media negativity.

Don’t get me wrong. If the economic data remains negative, I’ll pull back my positivity. So far I haven’t seen enough to change my view.

You see, history and economic training has taught me not to rely on one month’s figures. Confidence readings can also be very volatile, just like our emotions, and that is what the media cashes in on to boost readership.

Let’s take the latest Westpac monthly consumer confidence number, which showed consumer confidence fell by 4.6% in September to 94, but ANZ’s weekly one showed a 0.6% rise in the past week. While just a couple of weeks ago, CommSec used the headline “Confident Consumers” when retail spending rose by 0.4% in July, after a 0.6% rise in June. In fact, annual spending growth rose from 5.6% to 5.9% – well above the decade average of 4.3%.

This good news (based on actual spending) gets forgotten against some survey based on people’s whims, which are often driven by bad media headlines.
What we’re seeing now is also a consequence of the misguided, badly sold Budget, which was seen to be too harsh on the economy when it needed positivity to get growth and jobs up, confidence up, tax revenue up and the deficit down.

Governments should not be adding to negativity. Let the Budget bull dust go and get on with the job of building confidence. The best way to do this is by making sure you give nothing to the negativity-programmed media to run with.

2. Individual Trustee vs. Corporate Trustee?
3. Top tips for SMSF trustees

It seems that those who fall into the Gen Y category aren’t taking their super seriously. I believe that this group are failing to recognise the importance of their retirement savings due to one, or all, of the misconceptions below.

“I don’t have enough super for it to be worth my time”.

Over one third of Gen Y’s don’t know how much super they have, and nearly eight out of 10 admit that they have no idea how much they are paying in fees. Even those with small amounts of money in their super should be on the constant look out for the best deal and the lowest fees, and it is always important to ask where your fund plans to invest your money. At the end of the day, it is YOUR money and you should know where it is invested!
 
“I can’t use the money until I retire so why does it matter?”

This goes back to my previous point: it is YOUR money!

If you had $20,000 savings and wanted to grow and build it, would you put it in a bank offering you a return of 2.5% or 4.5%? I think the answer is obvious. This same thought process needs to be applied to your super. Even though you can’t access your super until you retire, that 2% difference compounded annually can vastly change how much super you are able to retire on.
 
“I don’t earn enough money right now, so I’ll wait until I earn more and then look at my super”.

Compulsory employer contributions to super is currently 9.5% of your annual income. So, even for those earning Australia’s minimum annual salary ($32,354.40), that is still just over $3,000 a year. 

Example of how interest can affect your super savings:

Joe Public invests in a super fund which offers 2.5% interest. With 35 years left until retirement and a starting super balance of $20,000, Joe is set to retire with $326,788.
Now, if Joe had invested in a super fund that offered 4.5% interest, based on the same starting balance ($20,000) with the same number of years left until retirement (35 years), he would be able to retire on $459,536. That’s a difference of $132,748!

Even if you were to earn the minimum annual salary for the rest of your life, finding a better deal has the potential to net you over $120,000 extra for retirement.

Remember, it is never too early or too late to start saving for your retirement.

1. Sydney market continues to show growth
2. Capital City Property Market Update

There is an age old question that never seems to get answered in an honest way:

Which is the better investment – Property or Shares?

This article aims to give you a brief but honest, unbiased answer.

I have read many reports that indicate the share market is the better performer, however this is only true some of the time. Reports achieve this notion by considering particular time frames which happen to favour the share market. Equally, the higher level of risk associated with share investments are not taken into consideration.

Firstly, let’s start with the pros and cons of property investments:

Pros
‘Must have’ assets usually have higher levels of growth due to constant demand. Housing falls in to this asset class.
Property is a unique asset class as we are all users of some form of housing.
Property is generally thought to be understood by most people – many think it is a very safe asset to own.
Property has a slightly negative correlation with other asset sectors. That is, there is a slight tendency for housing to rise in value when other asset sectors fall in value.
There can be few lies about a property – it can be personally audited by inspection or other professionally employed people. This contrasts to a share purchase where you rely on the company’s directors reporting honest facts on performance, and behaving in line with laws and corporate regulations.
It is unlikely that property will have zero value. Shares, however, can perform badly and result in no value.
Bankers typically lend more funds against a housing asset and lend at a lower interest rate.
The property market has a very substantial value. It is estimated that the total value of all residential property in Australia is approximately $5 trillion, while the stock market is estimated to be worth around $1.5 trillion.
Today, the property market is an asset class where significant information about its performance and characteristics is available.
Cons
Property investment is relatively illiquid. That is, you can’t wake up one day and decide that you need to dispose of a property – it can take many months to sell.
It is not easy to identify the market value of a property.
Property investment is a large commitment – in today’s market, you will be up for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
It is difficult to diversify and spread your risk across many markets simply because of the cost of each property investment.

Overall, property investing probably carries a lower risk than share investment. However, to best answer the question, a quality analysis should be made.

Quality analysis involves examining a large number of different investment periods over the long term, being made at all possible times. The results should then draw on the median outcome (with respect to each time period). Analysis should also take into account all potential income streams of the assets and allow for leveraging and taxation. Graph 1 provides the outcome of such an analysis.

The latest research by Onthehouse.com.au has revealed Australia’s most expensive states, suburbs and streets, statistically highlighting the number of million dollar properties in each state or territory’s metro and regional areas.

The findings showed that NSW was the wealthiest state when it comes to residential property, with 23.4% of dwellings in the metro suburbs valued at over $1 million in 2014. However, the number of million dollar properties in the state’s regional market was only 0.6%, meaning NSW had the highest disparity between its metro and regional districts.

VIC ranked as the second wealthiest state, with 12.4% of its metro properties being valued over $1 million. This was followed by metro WA (9.9%) and the ACT (4.9%).

The wealthiest regional market was the NT, where 1.4% of properties were found to be valued over the $1 million mark. This compares to its metro market where 3.7% of properties were valued at $1 million or more.

John Edwards, Consulting Analyst for Onthehouse.com.au, said: “It’s interesting to note the pecking order of the states when it comes to wealthy neighbourhoods. While it was no surprise to see NSW heading up the metro table, it was a pleasant surprise to see the NT leading the regional localities.”

Unsurprisingly, the most expensive street in the country can be found in metro NSW – with Raglan Street in Mosman accommodating 297 properties with a minimum million-dollar price tag.

SA was found to be the least expensive state overall in Australia, with 2.0% and 0.1% of properties in the metro and regional markets respectively valued above $1 million.

Mr Edwards said: “Everybody is always interested in the wealth of a neighbourhood when looking to invest, or even the wealth of their own or surrounding vicinities. Our research delves into property values on a street-by-street level to allow the Australian public an insider of an area’s affluence.”

Mr Edwards added: “Based on our findings, we expect to see new suburbs emerge as millionaire property hotspots over the coming year. It was interesting to note that Glen Waverley topped the chart as the suburb with the largest increase in million dollar properties over the last 12 months, closely followed by Mount Waverley, Balwyn North, Northcote and Bentleigh.”

Being a first time buyer in today’s market is tough with the situation showing no signs of improvement. 

Recent figures from the ABS state that less than 1 in 8 home loans are being made to first time buyers, with the average loan value up by almost 5% year on year.

While this increase might seem small, it is adding over $10,000 to the average loan. This means that prices have also risen, probably by about $12,000 to $13,000. Not to mention all of the extra interest that will need to be paid over the life of the loan.

I have been advocating a fair go for first time buyers for many years now, in the hope that the federal government and state governments would come up with a way to help more of them get a foot onto the proper ladder.

Finding the cash to put down a deposit is one of the biggest obstacles aspiring home owners face today. As the cost of living and property prices continue to go up, the deposit gap keeps growing bigger and bigger. Therefore, any approach that can help aspiring buyers save a deposit would be a great advantage. One way to do this, which is getting a fair bit of publicity and exposure at the moment, is to allow first time buyers access to their superannuation savings.

This method might go against the grain of those who think super should only be used for retirement, and for the most part I agree with this viewpoint. But, in the meantime, we also need a place to live and property is a great way to create wealth.

Providing access to super would make it possible for people to achieve their retirement goals and own their own home at the same time. In turn, this would provide major short term and long term social and financial benefits.

There are a number of benefits of allowing first time buyers to access their super:

Greater equity in their property at time of purchase.
Enter the market sooner – by allowing first time buyers access to their super, this will reduce the time it takes for them to save up a deposit.
Cost reduction – lower borrowings means paying less interest and saving on lenders mortgage insurance. Both of these can add up to tens of thousands of dollars, which could be equal to or greater than what the equivalent amount may have earned if it remained in super.
Improved affordability – providing access to super would increase the amount of funds first time buyers have to fund a home purchase, without the federal and state governments dipping into the public purse to fund grants and concessions.
Level the playing field – give first time buyers a fair chance against investors, and help all first time buyers – not just those eligible for government grants.

It was interesting to note that New Farm also topped the chart as the suburb with the largest increase in million dollar properties over the last 12 months, with Bulimba coming in third - while the up-and-coming areas of Paddington, Surfers Paradise and Bardon made up the remainder of the Top Five.”

More and more Australians are taking control of their retirement savings with self managed super funds, which are now the largest and fastest growing segment of the superannuation industry.

According to the latest Australian Taxation Office (ATO) figures, the number of SMSFs is now at 516,925. The data revealed that nearly 1 million Australians are SMSF trustees and hold one third ($520.5 billion) of the $1.7 trillion invested in Australian superannuation funds.

These figures clearly demonstrate the increasing popularity of SMSF investing, and illustrates the important role SMSFs play for retirement savings and estate planning for many Australians.

Being a trustee of a SMSF is an important role that brings increased responsibilities and obligations with it.

The below tips provide a simple introductory guide to understanding some of the key obligations associated with being a SMSF trustee.

Ongoing Compliance

Trustees should be educated about the compliance requirements for running a SMSF. Trustees should aim to have good compliance procedures in place from the start, and plan well to always meet deadlines.

New trustees must sign a New Trustee Declaration within 21 days of becoming a trustee. The declaration contains important information on general trustee duties, investment restrictions, the sole purpose test, record keeping and reporting obligations, among other things.
Administration

Administration duties of a SMSF can be delegated to professional providers, such as The SMSF Club. However, it is important that trustees understand that the delegation of duties is not the same as the delegation of responsibilities – you will remain responsible for compliance and observing the rules for SMSFs, even if you outsource the administrative tasks.
Recording Keeping and Reporting

It is important to set up good reporting practices from the start.

Good reporting flows on from understanding compliance, keeping up with compliance procedures, and good administration. Essential features of good reporting practice include keeping accounting records, lodging returns and forms on time, and getting a professional audit. This will allow you to provide an accurate and detailed history of your fund, help you make decisions for your fund, and demonstrate that you have complied with superannuation laws and regulations.

Some tips for good reporting include:
Keeping meeting minutes and documenting decisions
Trustee declarations
Annual audit records
Audit reports
Investment strategies
Registration documents and ownership and investment documents
Notices of compliance
Tax returns
Operating statements
Bank account statements
Tax Management

Before setting you fund, it is advisable to obtain advice from a SMSF professional (the structure of your fund will affect your tax liabilities).

Keeping in mind that you need to lodge an annual tax return for your SMSF, the audit report for your fund needs to be available at the same time your tax return is lodged.
Investment Strategies

SMSFs tend to incorporate longer term investment strategies. However, this can vary depending on an individual SMSF and its members, so a good starting point is to clearly set out your investment objectives.

Appropriate diversification (whether or not to invest across a number of asset classes), meeting the costs of running the fund, and individual needs of members need to be taken into account.
Professional Consultation

Knowing when to get professional advice is important. Changing laws and regulations, as well as the complexity of tax law, means it is often a good idea for a SMSF trustee to get regular advice and assistance from a SMSF professional. Not only can professional advice help you with compliance and day-to-day administration issues, professional guidance is beneficial for educating yourself in investing and tax strategies.

2. Find the hidden gems of property investment
3. Get the best price for your investment property

Following on from my previous article: Do holiday homes make good investments?, for those who have decided that buying a holiday home is a good investment for them, I’ve put together my top tips to help you on your way.

In my last article, we went over the advantages and disadvantages of buying a holiday home. In summary, we concluded the following:

Positives
Unlimited access
Help bring family and friends together
Are capable of being turned into a second home
Can generate rental income and capital growth
Could end up being a great permanent retirement destination
Negatives
Holiday homes can be expensive to maintain
There may be limited tax advantages
They can mislead people into thinking they provide a free holiday
Variety is limited (same location)
The benefit of ownership can be limited when having to give priority to renters
Holiday homes may not generate the rental income and capital gains expected

As you can see, there are some compelling reasons for and against buying a so-called lifestyle properties. For those who have weighed up their options and are now keen to buy a holiday home investment, here are my top tips to help you on your way:

Do your research

Research the market and get an understanding of how the holiday market works, particularly in the area you’re thinking of buying into.

Remember to try and leave the emotion out of your purchase – you’re not just buying a property, you’re buying a business. Therefore, you need to ensure you have the skills, knowledge and capital to make your business successful.

Get expert advice where needed – consult your accountant, tax and financial adviser, and get a solid understanding on what is happening in the property market – a good starting point for this is to read the latest State Market Report.

It is also a good idea to put a business plan together. With this, you will know what has to be done, by whom and by when. It will also ensure that you understand the financial risks and rewards, and, most importantly, whether a holiday home will deliver the personal and financial objectives you’re after.
Prepare a budget

When you put your plan together, make sure you crunch your numbers. Put together a comprehensive profit, loss and cash flow budget, and investigate what you can and can’t claim for tax purposes.

This could have a big impact on how you fund your purchase, including how much of your own after-tax cash you’ll have to contribute each month. You should consult with you tax agent or accountant before you buy also to find out what negative gearing benefits you qualify for.

Things to account for when putting your budget together:
Vacancy rates
Cleaning and maintenance costs
Property management costs
Insurance
Depreciation
Replacement of broken, lost and stolen items

"The Reserve Bank of Australia announced today that the official cash rate will remain on hold in August at 2.5 per cent, after board members noted that inflation remained under control and the Australian dollar's strength was holding back the transition away from mining sector growth.

The decision, which was widely expected, means that interest rates have now been kept on hold for an entire year, which is the longest single period since 2006.

Nine out of 15 economists surveyed predict an interest rate hike in the first half of 2015, which would be the first increase in more than four years.

The RBA said: ""In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.""

The strength of the Australian dollar has weighed heavily on RBA governor Glenn Stevens' deliberations in recent month, as it is out of step with Australia's declining terms of trade and makes non-commodity exports less competitive globally.

3. Top tips for SMSF trustees

When structuring your SMSF, there are two options when it comes to nominating the trustees:

1. Individual Trustees – where each member of the fund is a trustee, or
2. Corporate Trustees – where each member of the fund is a director of the trustee company.

Many people opt for individual trustees because the establishment and ongoing costs are less than those associated with corporate trustees. However, while it appears to be cheaper upfront, there are additional responsibilities and ongoing liabilities that need to be considered prior to deciding which option is best for your fund.
The below points compares the benefits, costs and disadvantages associated with individual trustees and a corporate trustees, to help you make an informed decision on which is best for you and your SMSF.

Individual Trustees

Individual trustees are responsible for running a SMSF. Almost anyone over the age of 18 can be a trustee, including a spouse, your children (if they are older than 18) or friends. Each fund must have a minimum of two and a maximum of four trustees.

The main benefit of having individual trustees manage your SMSF is that the ongoing administrative requirements and up front establishment costs are usually less than those associated with a corporate trustee running your fund.

However, there are also a number of disadvantages associated with individual trustees, which include:

Appointing additional members and trustees can result in tedious and expensive administrative work.
You cannot manage a SMSF as an individual trustee with only one member. Single member funds can only operate under a corporate trustee.
There are liability issues – if the SMSF is sued, the right of indemnity can extend beyond the assets of the SMSF. That is, if the assets of the fund are not sufficient to discharge the liability, then individual trustees may be personally liable for the shortfall.
Corporate Trustee

You can select a company to act as a trustee for your SMSF, which means all members of the SMSF will need to be directors of the company. The directors are responsible for the running of the SMSF.

There are several long term benefits a corporate trustee can offer a SMSF, including:

A company has the benefit of limited liability. If a corporate trustee suffers any liability, the individual directors will not bear any personal liability (other than in exceptional circumstances).
A company continues to function after the death of one a SMSF’s members.
Assets are clearly separated from personal assets.
If a new member is introduced to the SMSF, in general, they must become a trustee of the fund. With a corporate trustee, a new director needs to be appointed to the company and the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) must be notified. The process is more complex, time consuming, and expensive for individual trustees – titles need to be changed for each asset held within the SMSF to reflect the change of trustees. With a corporate trustee, the title remains the same.
When buying property and entering into limited recourse loan agreements, the bank will usually lend a corporate trustee additional funds to purchase a property. The borrowing rate under individual trustees is usually 72% versus up to 80% under a corporate trustee.

The disadvantages associated with having a corporate trustee include:

Additional administrative costs to establish a corporate trustee.
Annual ASIC fees.
There is additional paperwork required, and directors have to comply with the company’s constitution and articles.

"What is a Self Managed Super Fund?

A Self Managed Superannuation Fund (SMSF) is a specialised retirement savings vehicle, used to accumulate superannuation money for retirement benefits for members.

SMSFs operate in the same way as any other superannuation fund, however the responsibility of managing the fund rests with the trustee. With a SMSF, you can be both a member and a trustee. Therefore, establishing a SMSF can be a major decision for you.

What are the benefits?

There are several benefits that a SMSF enjoys over alternative and more traditional retirement savings options. By opting to use a SMSF for retirement savings, trustees are able to enjoy the following benefits:

Flexibility
Taxation Benefits
Options for Investments
Increased Control for Trustees

Trustees are able to invest in assets of their choice and recover excess franking credits from the Australian Taxation Office each financial year. The ability to control your own superannuation interests is a major factor for individuals looking to establish their own SMSF.

How do SMSF work?

SMSFs are established through the signing of a trust deed, which outlines the rules and regulations of the fund. Funds are governed by the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and by the various regulations included in this legislation.

Each SMSF can have between one and four members, and is operated by a single trustee or a group of trustees.

Once the deed has been signed, the fund is required to operate as a totally separate entity, hold at least one meeting annually and ensure that the fund is complying for the entire financial year.

What about Taxes?

SMSFs receive the same tax concessions as any other super fund, and any concessional contributions made will be taxed at 15 percent.

Capital gains incurred by the fund also receive tax concessions – where the asset is owned for more than 12 months, a one third discount will be applied to the total capital gain.

What are your options?

There are two options when establishing your SMSF. Will you be the trustee, or will you appoint a company to act as the trustee? This will depend on your individual circumstances, and it is best to seek advice on this matter.

It is also important to remember that, as with any type of investment, there are risks associated with buying an investment property through a SMSF. SMSFs will not be suited to all Australians, so it is important to seek independent advice prior to establishing a SMSF.

2. Managing your mortgage stress
3. Which is better: capital growth or rental yield?

Holiday homes are typically located on the coast – in popular tourist destinations, in the country, or by many of Australia’s inland rivers and waterways. Owning a holiday home seems to be the ambition of many Australians, and in fact, one in every twelve households owns one (around 700,000 of them are owned by the 8.18 million households in this country).

The reasons why holiday homes are popular is clear. From a personal perspective, everyone has those special places they visited where they could unwind and relax away from the rat race, enjoy the scenery, trek through the countryside and swim in clear waters. These experiences hold special memories for most, especially when kids and family are involved, and so there is a natural desire to want to own those experiences and be able to enjoy them again and again.

From a financial perspective, there is the rationale that if we enjoyed the experience others would too. Therefore, buying and renting property in popular tourist destinations makes financial sense. After all, if there’s money to be made renting property to people who want to live in them (tenants), there should be money to be made in renting property to those who want to have fun in them (holidaymakers).

Of course, buying a holiday home as an investment it isn’t quite that simple. Like any major purchase or investment, you need to do your research first and be absolutely sure it’s the right thing for you before committing.

To help you decide whether you should buy a holiday home, let’s weigh up the positives and negatives associated with this type of investment.

Postivies
Unlimited Access
A big advantage is you can have unlimited access to the property and you can visit whenever you like. This reduces the amount of forward planning needed and allows spontaneity for those spur of the moment trips.
 
Family and Friends Benefit
A holiday home could be used by close family and friends as a place everyone can come together in a fun and safe environment. They are often a great place to bring the family closer together while giving them their own space, especially for older kids.
 
Second Home
If you use the property a lot you may be able to turn it into your second home. You can include your own comforts, personal taste and lifestyle needs. Another plus is that it should cut down on your packing since most of what you need is already there.
 
Offset Costs
As with any investment property, you can offset holding and borrowing costs with rental income. If you buy wisely you could enjoy some good capital growth when it comes time to sell.
 
Place for Retirement
If the location is somewhere you enjoy and it has everything you need, it could be a an ideal place to retire. At the very least you’ll be familiar with the property, its location and your neighbours. These are big benefits when you’re looking to make that permanent sea change or tree change.

"New data from Onthehouse.com.au has revealed that outer city regions are set to provide the best investment opportunities, based on rental and capital returns. 

NSW dominated the list, with four suburbs in the top 10.

Jerrabomberra was the hottest pick, with price growth predicted to be in excess of 10 per cent per year over the next five years, and rental yields in the suburb are sitting around 5.15 per cent.

Other NSW suburbs included Karabar (fourth), Banora Point (ninth) and Medowie (tenth).

Morayfield in Queensland, Seville Grove in Western Australia and Ngunnawal in Australian Capital Territory were all identified as the best rental spots in their respective states, all with predicted growth of above 10 per cent per annum expected.

Victoria did not have any suburbs ranking in the top 10.

“Buying in a regional area might not be for everyone but with strong predicted growth and high rental yields, it’s certainly an option to consider,” says John Edwards, consulting analyst for Onthehouse.com.au.

“With more expensive areas, such as Sydney, outer city regions can be much more affordable – pair that with strong growth and it could be a good fit for investors wanting to get good rental returns and capital growth over time.”

The top 10 suburbs were calculated based on rental yields, five year capital growth predictions, industry surroundings, confidence ratings and employment opportunities.

Source: Onthehouse.com.au

“Investors should be looking for locations that have good employment opportunities, education options, are well connected to transport and have planned developments in the area that will attract the population,” says Edwards.

“The latest Best Rent Report highlights 58 areas around Australia that meet this criteria, each offering returns of better than 10% per annum.”


Mr Edwards continued to explain that pairing data with local knowledge can be very powerful. “Our research draws on industry and environmental surroundings and employment opportunities, which will influence property prices. These areas are the suburbs we think will perform well. However, it’s crucial that buyers do their own personal research and build on this statistical information.”

"Almost all of Australia's major country and metropolitan markets have recorded positive growth in the year to June 2014, making it a good year for existing home owners (see Table 1).

Table 1 – Australian Property Market Update



In the past 12 months, Australian houses and units have increased 7.09% and 7.70% respectively as a whole. The Sydney market again led the way, recording a staggering 15.37% growth rate in the house market and 13.30% growth in unit values. This translates to a dollar increase in value of almost $110,000 and $67,000 respectively.

While most markets achieved growth in the last year, there were two markets where values dropped. In the house market, Darwin values declined 1.1% in the year to June, while in the unit market Tasmania recorded growth of -0.21% during the same time period.

Given the recent change in the government, it’s not surprising to see low capital growth figures in Canberra market. Growth in the Canberra house and unit markets were the second worst amongst the nation, at 0.29% and 1.61% respectively.

Despite high growth in the last year, the data trend indicates that our housing markets are cooling (see Graph 1). The trend suggests that the rate of growth is moderating, and while this will not be uniform across Australia, it is the more likely outcome in the Sydney and Melbourne markets where the highest growth rates have been achieved.

Borrowing Rules

Funding your retirement through wealth created from owning residential property is not a new concept. Prior to compulsory super, many generations worked hard to pay off their mortgage and set up their retirement. Once they reached retirement age, they simply sold their home, downsized, and used the equity they created from their property to fund their retirement lifestyle.

Previously, buying residential property inside of super was out of reach for many Australians, mainly due to the costs associated and the high entry level to buy an average property. Buying just one residential investment property in most states in Australia incurred costs of well over $400,000. Therefore, in the past, you needed to have at least $400,000 inside your super fund to buy just one property, and this didn’t account for associated transaction costs such as stamp duty.

Thankfully, these rules have now been changed.

In 2007, superannuation rules were changed to allow you to borrow money inside of a self managed super fund (SMSF) to purchase both residential and commercial property. Now, banks are willing to lend your SMSF up to 80% of the residential property’s value.

For example, if you are looking to buy a $400,000 residential investment property using your SMSF, the bank will lend your SMSF up to $320,000 to help fund the purchase. All you require is the $80,000 difference plus the funds required to cover any transaction costs and ongoing fees in your SMSF.

Most banks will have special arrangements in place for SMSF trustees wanting to borrow funds to buy an investment property. The process to gain approval for a SMSF investment property loan is quite different to obtaining a property loan in your own name. Borrowing arrangements inside of super will need to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.

To meet borrowing rules, a SMSF can only borrow funds to invest in direct property through a special structure called a Bare Trust (also known as a Property Trust or Custodian Trust). Although the legal title will rest with the Bare Trust, the SMSF maintains the beneficial ownership of the property, meaning the SMSF will receive all of the rental income and capital gains made by the investment property. The purpose of this arrangement is so that the lender can take charge of the property if the SMSF fails to meet the interest obligations and pay off the loan.

1. Low deposit loans – Are they good or bad for borrowers?
2. Managing your mortgage stress

Currently, home loan lenders are in a great position – interest rates are low, house price growth is creating strong demand, default rates are at a historically low level and loan loss levels are acceptable. However, the increase in higher risk loans has become a concern because of what might happen to lenders’ balance sheets should house prices stagnate or fall, and/or should defaults increase from this group given that interest rates will inevitably start to rise.

High risk loans are generally deemed those given to borrowers who have less than a 20% deposit, or loans given to people with credit, savings and/or employment history problems.

The Australian Prudential Regularity Authority (APRA), which is responsible for overseeing all the banks, credit unions and building societies, has expressed its concern over the increase in higher risk loans in the face of growing competition between lenders, paying particular attention to lending with a loan-to-value ratio (LVR) of higher than 80%.

According to the APRA, more than a third of new lending had a LVR higher than 80% in the quarter ending March 2014, while 13% of bank loans and 17% of loans from non-bank lenders had LVR’s or 90% or more. This indicates the growing competition in the home loan market, and the targeting of borrowers with lower deposits to grow market share – especially from non-bank lenders.

Loans sourced from the broker channel has not contributed to the growth in home lending in recent years. Broker lending has in fact declined -0.2% in the last five years due to reduced volumes and flat house prices, according to recent reports from IBISWorld. However, this trend is expected to reverse significantly in the next few years and it would be a good bet that a large portion of growth will come from the riskier end of the market.

Lending from brokers is forecast to hit around 5% per annum next year and beyond, and reach the $2.0 billion mark by 2018/2019 (it reached $1.5 billion in 2014). So, lenders may have to rethink how they deal with brokers, and what types of loans they will accept from this channel to ensure compliance with APRA guidelines.

Mortgage lending accounts for around half of the credit exposure of the major lenders. While I don’t think the situation is serious yet, the APRA is not taking any chances and it has made it clear that it wants the industry to take a less risky approach to new lending activities.

The APRA is currently seeking feedback from the industry on how to best lift lending standards and reduce exposure to high LVR loans without unduly limiting access to finance or damaging lenders profit and growth targets.

If a consensus can’t be reached, the alternative is to impose lending restrictions or quotas on these types of loans (similar to New Zealand), but I don’t expect it will come to that.
Lenders are being encouraged to avoid increasing their loan books by lowering their lending standards, which could have a flow on effects to prospective home buyers and investors as mortgage providers may tighten their lending guidelines, especially for loans above 90% LVR. With this in mind, I have come up with some tips to help ensure you have the best chance of getting your home or investment loan approved.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia announced today that the official cash rate will remain on hold at a record-low 2.5 per cent, awaiting further signs that the tapering of the resource boom will not lift unemployment. The cash rate has not moved since August 2013.

The decision was widely anticipated by property industry commentators, with 18 surveyed industry experts recently predicting the cash rate would stay on hold. However, 11 of that panel expect an increase will occur within the next 12 months.

Governor Glenn Stevens said in a statement that financial conditions overall remain very accommodative.

""Long-term interest rates and risk spreads remain low. Emerging market economies are once again receiving capital inflows. Volatility in many financial prices is currently unusually low.

"Table 1 presents the Australian-wide outcome for May 2014.

Table 1

 

Capital growth figures in May were lower than previous months and there were a number of capital cities that in fact fell in value. However, the monthly numbers are good news as far as I am concerned, and they are exactly what I was hoping for.

Housing markets were moving to a boom like performance, particularly Sydney, which is a dangerous situation that can lead to a bubble and a severe correction. The slowing of the market at this point in time suggests that we are going to avoid this outcome. With any luck, the lower rates of growth will continue over the next few months. While the May figures are not sufficient to confirm that lower growth rates are the new trend, it is my best guess that lower growth rates will continue. 

Despite the lower rates of growth in May, the market is still overvalued and in reality too expensive.

Table 2 provides a summary of national affordability.

Table 2 

The data clearly points to the difficult affordability conditions for the median family in most capital cities.

The after tax remaining dollars calculation that a median family has left to spend after meeting home loan repayments is the best indicator of the affordability position in each market.

Sydneysiders feel the most strain, having just $821 per week to spend after making home loan repayments on the median home (valued at $823,500), assuming a 20% deposit. This is clearly insufficient for comfortable living.

1. Borrowing woes continue
2. Managing your mortgage stress

Finding the cash to put down a deposit is a continuing problem for property buyers, particularly first time buyers and investors.

This has led to an increase in lenders providing higher risk loans in order to gain market share – in particular loans where loan-to-value ratios (LVR) are higher than 80%.

According to the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA), more than a third of new lending had a LVR higher than 80% in the quarter ending March 2014, while 13% of bank loans and 17% of loans from non-bank lenders had LVR’s or 90% or more.

The APRA has recently expressed its concern about the level of risk and loan quality lenders are prepared to take on in order to gain market share (read my article ‘Borrowing woes continue’ for more details on this), and lenders are being encouraged to avoid increasing their loan books by lowering their lending standards.

In light of this, I think it is also important to consider whether it is good for borrowers to take on higher LVR loans.

I have always advocated that buyers should contribute a decent deposit, which I think should be around the 20% mark and no less than 10%. This view seems to be shared by APRA, at least from a macro perspective.

However, coming up with a 20% deposit is tough enough when house prices are relatively stable, but now that prices are on the rise, the ability to save a decent deposit is getting further out of reach for more and more aspiring property owners.

The property market is currently present us with what I would call a perfect storm. There are increasing property prices at a time when interest rates are low (both generally considered good things), at the same time as more stringent lending guidelines are coming in to play (considered prudent). This, combined with other factors like increasing demand and lack of supply, is locking more and more people out of the property market because they cannot bridge the deposit gap.

In today’s perfect storm environment, there may be occasions where a smaller deposit may be the only option for many borrowers. While this is not ideal, it may still be a reasonable approach.

Judging by current lending volumes (one in three new loans are at or above 80% LVR, and around one in eight are above 90% LVR), the reality that many home buyers and investors are struggling to save a decent deposit is loud and clear.

It’s also worth mentioning that the days of no deposit purchases are gone, and I say good riddance to them. 100% mortgages were a disaster for many borrowers who over-committed and found themselves in financial difficulties with no equity to cushion them when financial problems hit. This left many people with negative equity (often from day one) and in a lot of trouble when they couldn’t meet their mortgage repayments.

So, is a low deposit loan a good thing?

Let’s define a low deposit loan as one where the deposit is under 10% of the purchase price and would typically sit around the 5% mark.

To put this into context for you, the table below compares the different deposit requirements for a $400,000 property. It is pretty clear that the lower the deposit the quicker and easier it is to enter the market.

Table 1: Different deposit requirements for a $400,000 property.

There are mixed views on the merits of taking out a low deposit loan, so let’s explore the pros and cons of the situation.

"Problems with affordability could be causing growth in the residential property market to stall.

According to new research by Onthehouse.com.au, residential capital growth rates for May were lower than expected, with numbers dropping in many capital cities.

Nationwide, houses values grew by only 0.36%, while unit values dropped by 0.23%, in May. This compares to last quarter where house values grew by 1.71% and unit values grew by 1.17%.

Onthehouse.com.au consulting analyst John Edwards said the data clearly pointed to the difficult affordability conditions for the median family in most capital cities.

The number of people who could afford to buy and then repay a loan for a home was now limited, he said.

For example, when looking at the calculated figure the median Sydney family would have to spend after tax and meeting home loan repayments, it was too small to maintain a reasonable standard of living.

“The Sydney median family who buy the current median property valued at $823,500 with a 20% deposit only have around $821 per week to spend after making home loan repayments. This amount is clearly insufficient for comfortable living.”

In May, Sydney house growth stalled at just 0.24% - although it still recorded 17.42% growth over the last 12 months.

The data also indicated that the Sydney unit market had passed its peak, with growth of 2.81% for the quarter ending May.

Edwards said it was not clear whether the house and land market had arrived at the same position – although auction clearance rates suggested the market was slowing.

Meanwhile, Melbourne house values fell by 0.03% in May, which meant they entered negative territory. However, over the past 12 months, this market recorded 9.45% growth.

Slower growth rates would be beneficial for the economy, as they meant a property market “bubble” followed by a severe correction was likely to be avoided, Edwards said.

However, the Sydney market was still overvalued and too expensive, he added.

“The data from May is not sufficient on its own to confirm that this lower rate of growth is about to be a new feature, but my best guess is that this will be the case.”

"The much dreaded Federal Budget has been presented and from a housing market perspective it is of little consequence. There was nothing that directly, or for that matter indirectly, impacted on property prices. However, the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 28.5 per cent from July 2015 adds a pressure to consider investing under a corporate structure where an investment property is not negatively geared. This is particularly so where the investment is going to be held for a considerable period. The difference between the discounted (50 per cent) capital gains tax (CGT) personal marginal rate and the corporate tax rate is now minimal and over time the benefit of the lower corporate tax rate on income could relatively quickly absorb the positive CGT discount benefit.

Growth in Sydney has continued, which is good news for long standing existing property owners, and the median value of Sydney houses has now passed the $800,000 mark. Sydney house price growth has not been seen for the same period of time since September 1988, when Sydney saw the last large property price boom.

Growth in the Melbourne house market was also strong, at 10.85 per cent for the year and 1.42 per cent for the month of April. Brisbane also produced a strong result in April with house price growth of 1.36 per cent.

The strong results are surprising as the data until April was indicting that the markets were cooling. This cooling was justified given the difficult affordability conditions that exist. Continued strong growth at this time could pose problems. The Sydney market in particular could well be moving into some dangerous ground on a couple of fronts:

The growth in real terms (after inflation) for the last 12 months is about 17.25 per cent for houses and 10.78 per cent for units. It is reasonable to suggest that this market is approaching a boom mentality and this situation is dangerous, particularly for those who are borrowing heavily to get into the market. Interest rates are more likely than not to increase now as we move forward.
The current median value of Sydney houses is $821,500. This would require the median Sydney family to pay around 52 p er cent of their after tax income (Affordability Ratio) to support home loan repayments on the median property, assuming a 20% deposit. This leaves just $812 per week available cash following home loan repayments, which certainly does not provide margins for emergencies and interest rate increases.
The high rate of growth will cause the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) some level of anxiety and potentially ensure there are no further interest rate decreases, and possibly bring forward interest rate increases.
Historically, once the Affordability Ratio breaches 50 per cent, the market usually adjusts.
All are expecting unemployment levels to increase and this situation, coupled will all of the above, could be a recipe for some significant adjustments later this year or, more likely, early next year.
The growth in the market, as one would expect, is larger for the properties that are valued below $600,000. This suggests that it is now middle to lower income groups that are currently driving the market. Unfortunately, this group will be those who are potentially the largest borrowers and will have lower capacity to absorb interest rate increases as they occur in a few months.

The magnitude of growth over the next few months will be important. If growth continues on its current upward path then there could potentially be some problems in the medium term as interest rates are increased. All of this suggests that bankers need to take care and not decrease lending standards to grow their businesses in a competitive market that is showing signs of getting overheated. At the end of the day, a market that is being driven by middle income Australians can’t grow excessively in a situation where lenders are exercising lending constraints.

"New research released today from Onthehouse's property data arm - Residex, revealed the Australian suburbs that have seen the largest capital growth over the last quarter for both houses and units nationally.

With Sydney’s property market still on fire, it took out most of the spots in the top 10 for houses and units, with stronger growth in property values than anywhere else in the country in the past three months.

According to the list, Beaumont Hills in Sydney topped the growth chart for houses with its median value up by 13.13% during the period.

In the unit market, Wollstonecraft – also in Sydney, had the best result with growth of 7.27% in the past three months.

Houses, however, outperformed unit suburbs, with double digit growth recorded in seven of the top suburbs.

Consulting analyst for Onthehouse, John Edwards, said that Sydney growth has continued through 2014.

“Growth in Sydney has continued, with house price growth of 8.15% in the last quarter. We have not seen this high level of quarterly growth since September 1988, when Sydney saw its last large property price boom.

“While the strong growth rates are good news for property owners, if growth continues on its current upward path there could potentially be some problems in the medium-term as interest rates are likely to increase.”

There was just one offering outside of New South Wales that made it onto the house suburb list – Melbourne’s Alphington.

The median value of houses in Alphington rose by 8.65% in the three month period. Balwyn and Box Hill, also suburbs of Melbourne, featured on the unit list, rising in value by 6.33% and 6.23% respectively.

The country Western Australian area of West Busselton also featured in the top 10 in terms of growth in the unit market, with its median values up by 6.77%.
Edwards urges anyone looking to buy to heavily research the area.

“Gathering information on a suburb is crucial before buying. Investors should be able to estimate where a suburb is in its growth cycle if they are considering buying in the area,” he said.

Mortgage stress is the point where a person breaches his or her level of home loan affordability. This is usually calculated as people paying more than 30% of their pre-tax income on home loan repayments. 

For example, a couple earning $100,000 a year would be in mortgage stress if their loan repayments exceeded $30,000 per annum. However, whether this is true or not is debatable because I believe the 30% benchmark is a flawed measure.

The issues with calculating mortgage stress

Applying an across the board measure implies a “one size fits all” approach, and fails to recognise that not all borrowers are the same. People have different spending patterns, financial commitments and income levels, and personal circumstances significantly affect what is and isn’t affordable.

For example, it is possible for a person paying 20% of their income towards their mortgage to be struggling to meet their repayments due to non-mortgage related expenses, while another person can live comfortably paying 40% of their income off their mortgage because their income, lifestyle and spending patterns support this level of payment.

Another issue I have with this calculation is the use of pre-tax income. We don’t pay our bills or spend our money before the tax office has taken its share of our income, so it’s our after-tax disposable income that is important. Further to this is the make-up of a household’s income.

A single income family earning $100,000 is most likely paying more tax than a double income family earning the same amount. This would suggest that the family with two incomes has more money left over after tax to meet their mortgage repayments.

The other interesting aspect to this measure is the inclusion of those who pay more through choice and as part of a debt reduction strategy.

While their payments may be above the limit, they are doing so because they can afford to and it doesn’t indicate they are facing financial difficulties.

To maximise your returns on a property investment, you need to be able to identify a suburb before it becomes popular and prices start to take-off.

Finding a suburb before it becomes hot is key (a hot suburb experiences a dynamic and upward shift in demand, putting it on par with the better established and popular areas). If you buy into a suburb late, increased demand will have pushed up prices – meaning you’ll end up paying more for a property, and you could also lose the short-term opportunity for capital growth due to the accelerated increase in property values. Medium-term growth will also flatten as prices start to stabilise once the heat is taken out of the market.

To help you find your next hidden gem, below are my top tips that will help you identify the signs that a suburb’s property prices are about to take off.

Look for the price ripple effect

Affordability and availability can limit property buyers buying in the area they want, so people with often look to buy in an adjacent suburb as an alternative.

This causes demand to increase in these suburbs, which in turn pushes up prices and the price-ripple effect occurs.

This is especially the case in capital city and major regional areas. So, keep an eye out for strong performing suburbs and consider the capital growth potential of the surrounding areas.

Find areas that have investment in infrastructure

Investment in and development of major infrastructure projects on things such as roads, transport and schools are signs of a growing population. This therefore indicates a growing demand for services such as housing, which could be a sign that an area's property market may start to increase in value.

Infrastructure developments can take years to complete, so the sooner you buy into the locations that are investing in the growth and development of the area, the more you’ll benefit when the wave of housing demand hits.

Keep track of announcements from business and government

When a large business or government entity announces it’s about to set up a major operation in a particular area, this is a sign that jobs and population growth may soon follow. However, there are two important points to remember in these situations:

Never buy on the strength of a single initiative because if that business or government entity decides not to invest or pulls out early, property values are likely to head south very quickly as employment opportunities disappear with the organisation.
If the announcement is part of a regeneration plan for the area, there’s probably an existing workforce and housing stock available. Therefore capital growth may not be as good as what would otherwise be the case.

Make sure you do your research on any planned or developing major projects, and on the current and forecast economic and employment situation within a suburb/region before you buy.

Take note of changing demographics

A major shift in the social or demographic make-up of a suburb can have a big impact on property values. For instance, if a suburb moves from being predominantly single occupancy to more family orientated, this will drive demand for multi-bedroom homes and prices will rise accordingly.

The key is to understand what’s driving the demographic change and to make sure it is a long-lasting one. It may be things such as immigration, population shift and/or employment opportunities.

4. Which is better: capital growth or rental yield?

How do you go about getting the best price possible when the time comes to sell your investment property? That is, one that will attract buyers and give you the return you seek.

Part of the answer lies in informing yourself about what the market is prepared to pay, remembering that more often than not your view and the market’s view on price can be quite different.

And let’s not forget that most purchasers need a mortgage with their lender, so what your lender’s valuer thinks the property is worth becomes central to getting the price you want.

As a rule of thumb, aim to get $5 return for every $2 you spend.

Where to start

Get your price expectations verified, or get help to set the price if you're not sure what a reasonable asking price is.  

Firstly, research your suburb on the Onthehouse Investor Centre.

You can then engage a reputable selling agent to drawing on their local knowledge and recent completed sales data in your area. Most selling agents can also provide you with comprehensive reports that provide useful insights for price setting and your marketing and sales strategies.

It’s important to remember that the selling agent’s price estimate is not a valuation, but more of a price guide. However, if the estimate is way below what you want, this indicates a problem and you may have to reassess your expectations.

The upside to this is that you can discuss any differences with your agent and work out what can be done to add value and improve your property’s appeal.

You can pay for your own independent valuation to give you that extra bit of comfort, but there are costs involved in doing so and you must ensure you ask for one that can be used for mortgage purposes so your valuer is thinking like the lender’s valuer.

Whichever approach you adopt, if there’s a match between the independent assessment of your property’s market value and what you’re after, then all is well and good. Otherwise, you’ll have to start working on adding value as quickly and cheaply as possible to bridge the gap.

What can't be fixed

Unfortunately there will be some things you won’t be able to fix when it comes to improving your property’s value. The main thing being location. You could have a fantastic property with all the mod-cons, but something about the property's position could be unattractive to buyers.

For instance, your property might be located next to a busy road, a power sub-station or an industrial park, or there could be other things that turn-off potential buyers.

Whilst it is possible to have both strong capital growth and a high rental yield, it is rare. More often than not it is a choice between one and the other.

The answer to this question is not as straight forward or obvious as one would hope because different personal and financial circumstances and investment strategies give rise to different responses.

On the one hand going for strong capital growth seems an obvious choice because of the potential to generate long-term capital profit. However, rental yields on high growth properties tend to be low meaning these properties are almost always negatively geared (that is, expenses (like mortgage interest and other costs) exceed the rent earned).

Whilst this provides the investor with some useful tax breaks (under current tax legislation) it still means they will be out of pocket each month until the property is sold.

Properties with a higher rental yield on the other hand, usually provide for a positively geared investment property (that is, where the rent exceeds all costs) meaning the investment pays for itself. It also means the property is generating cash reserves which can be used to pay down the loan or for any other purpose.

The downside is that when it comes time to sell, the capital gain is likely to be substantially less than that of the strong capital growth property, especially when taking into account the compounding impact of year-on-year growth.

Importantly, whilst it is possible to have both strong capital growth and a high rental yield, it is rare.

More often than not it is a choice between one and the other. And this in turn comes down to what best fits the investor’s objectives, risk profile and is the most affordable.

Strong capital growth strategy

Whenever you invest in residential property you want to generate a decent capital growth. The question becomes the quantum of this growth.

I would define strong capital growth as inflation plus 4 per cent to 5 per cent annually over the long term. So you are probably looking at growth rates at between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent.

The risk with this strategy is, as alluded to above, that you’ll likely be out of pocket while you hold the investment and will be subject to interest rate risk, whereby increases in mortgage rates can be painful, especially if there are contractual and market constraints which limit the ability to raise rents.

There are ways to mitigate these risks, like borrowing less and taking out a fixed rate loan, but generally speaking this is an ongoing problem for this type of strategy. In addition, a strong capital growth strategy places all your eggs in the one basket whereby all the profit is made sometime in future when the property is sold.

In the meantime, investors typically run at a loss and with negative cash flow.

We are spoiled for choice when it comes to residential investment property in this country. The problem is that not all locations and property types are going to deliver the financial and personal returns we seek.

If you’ve decided that investing in residential real estate is right for you the next step is to determine where and what type of property to buy.

With thousands of suburbs across Australia there’s no shortage of locations and regions to choose from.

And when it comes to property types there’s plenty to pick from including the ever popular standalone house, unit, semi-detached, terrace, town house, high-rise apartment and split purpose (commercial/residential) dwelling to name but a few.

So we are spoiled for choice when it comes to residential investment property in this country. The problem is that not all locations and property types are going to deliver the financial and personal returns we seek.

In fact many property investors are faced with what the American psychologist Barry Swartz coined the paradox of choice.

Swartz postulated that having more choices leads to greater anxiety levels because it becomes harder for us to select among a plethora of options all of which seem to deliver what we want and/or need.

So let’s try to take a little of the anxiety out of the equation when it comes to buying an investment property by identifying ways you can reduce your choices by eliminating properties that aren’t going to cut the mustard leaving you to focus on the few that are more suited to your needs.

Set minimum yield and growth requirements

Yield is the amount of income a property generates divided by its cost (calculated annually) and growth refers to how much the capital value of a property increases over time. Normally high growth properties will return low yields and vice-versa.

By setting yield and growth targets you can eliminate those properties that don’t meet your requirements. (We’ll look at yield versus growth in more detail in an upcoming article).

Ensure rental affordability

Aligned to the above is assessing average rents in the suburb you’re considering so you can quickly work out whether you are likely to be able to charge the rents you need to make the investment viable. If you can’t charge what you want than you should move to other areas and/or property types.

Aim for tenant appeal

Certain areas attract certain types of renters who have particular accommodation and location needs. This can include proximity to things like schools, shops, transport and nightlife. You therefore need to match the property you’re looking at buying with the potential tenant to ensure there’s a good fit.

Check vacancy rates

When a property is vacant it’s costing you money and the bills (like mortgage payments) don’t stop rolling in just because you don’t have a tenant.

Aim for suburbs where the rate is equal to or less than 3% as at this level your tenants will be easier to find and are more likely to stick around. Anything above this level increases vacancy risk meaning those locations are probably best left alone.

For instance be wary of investing in high rise/high density areas as these are often associated with high vacancy rates and poor capital returns.

"Our markets are behaving as one would expect in a situation where:

The cost of a home has risen to a level where the number of first home buyers capable of being part of the current growth cycle is limited.
The RBA is letting all who want to listen know that there will probably be no further interest rate cuts and that all should expect rates to rise in the next 12 months.
Consumer sentiment is not unexpectedly strong given the various warnings about a rising unemployment level.
Very significant “jawboning” by our Treasurer that we all have to take pain to allow our Federal Budget to return to surplus and government debt levels to be returned to more acceptable levels.

The Australia-wide dwelling growth position is provided in Graph 1.

Graph 1

The graph points to a market that is reaching the peak of its growth for this cycle. This is further evidenced by the lower auction clearance rates recently, which are now in the low 70% region.

The Sydney market has continued to power ahead. The median value of all house in Sydney is just $5,000 away from passing the $800,000 mark. As property prices have increased, the investor has suffered because although rental dollar costs have risen by about 6%, it is still someway off the increase seen in house prices. The consequence is that Sydney now is providing relatively unattractive rental yields for houses. The yield for units is a little better, but is now below 5%.

Table 1 - March Update

Our Federal Budget is due to be delivered on Tuesday, 13 May 2014 and we are being repeatedly told that there has to be significant cuts to expenditure. State Budgets will be delivered soon after the Federal Budget. Given this, I thought I may offer some suggestions to both levels of government. Yes, it probably won’t do us any good but perhaps they need something positive to make us all more accepting of the pain we are about to suffer. In essence, it is time to deliver something that is new and helpful to maintain and increase housing stock, but at the same time ensure it does not simply drive housing prices higher. This definitely rules out changes to negative gearing as its removal would simply reduce investor activity and available housing stock.

4. Which is better: capital growth or rental yield?

You’ve found the perfect location, and property values have shown good consistent growth over the years, but the property is old, rundown and in need of some serious modernising. So you ask yourself the question – is it better to renovate or detonate?

This is the question facing more and more homeowners and home buyers, especially when they like where they live and don’t want to move, or they’re thinking about buying but recognise further investment in the property will be required.

The below points help answer the question, and look at some of the key factors to consider when deciding between demolition and development.

1. Determine your property’s value: Compare property values in the street and neighbourhood

As a starting point, you should determine your property’s value. Check for price differentials between your property and comparable nearby ones. If your property is valued or priced less than everyone else’s, you need to find out the reasons why.

Some of the reasons why other properties may have a higher value are that they have a better view, location, or garden. However, in many cases, it is the house itself that is the differentiating factor.

Bigger and newer homes could have a higher value. The other houses may have better floor plans, be well decorated, be fitted with superior furnishings and fixtures, have all the mod-cons or better reflect its heritage and era.

Whatever the reason is, compare and contrast these factors against your own property so you can work out if improving your property’s value is worth the time, effort and money it may cost to add value and deliver what you’re looking for, while remembering to not overcapitalise.

2. Know what you want

Be clear about what you want. This is an important step where you need to clearly and comprehensively articulate the sort of property you want. For example, you may desire something that is older with all of its original features, or you may like a modern and contemporary home.

Also considering things such as size, layout (both internal and external), aspect, position, whether you want a single or double storey dwelling is important.

Once you know what you want, you can compare this to your current property and assess whether it can be transformed to meet your needs, or whether you are better off building a brand new dwelling in its place.

Be mindful that the property you have proposed is in character with the neighbourhood and meets the planning regulations. Contacting your local council and a good architect would be a good move.

"In Data We Trust

When it comes to the property market, understanding the data can be the difference between success or failure. 

The famed professor and statistician W. Edwards Deming once said: “In God we trust. All others must bring data”. For anybody interested in real estate, from the property professional to the armchair investor, this maxim is more relevant today than it has ever been.

Thanks to mobile and online technology, the average Australian is overwhelmed with access to a huge realm of data – from macro-economic trends such as interest rate changes to the in-depth granular property statistics on transactions and suburb details. There really is a smorgasbord of information at our fingertips.

The information is an invaluable tool. Data can help inform people’s property buying decisions and it can make us feel confident about –those decisions, by providing us with a guide to what will occur in the future.

But the important thing for us to realise is that not all information is created equally, particularly the statistics.

There are various sources of property information in the market. These include sales and listing records, auction clearance rates, various statistical measures from parties such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and many other non-government organisations. While some of this data is open and public, much is not. Taken together however, this data is extremely valuable, because of its multitude of applications:

Financial organisations use to it determine valuations for mortgages;
Investors and buyers can use data to pinpoint potential areas for investment; 
The Reserve Bank and Federal Treasury uses it to identify when markets are too hot and need cooling or stimulating;
State Governments use it to help predict their annual revenue as a large percentage comes from duties on property.

For the consumer or property professional, there are a host of third party sources that capture this data and present it in various forms. But not every source presents the same information.

Broadly, the challenges facing property information providers can be broken down into two areas: the accuracy and method for collecting the source data and the application and analysis of the data to provide real insight.

When it comes down to the first challenge – the freely available public data is obviously the first go-to source. It then comes down to enriching it that with deeper information, and this can be something as simple as having a team picking up the phone to real estate agents to find out who sold what. Obviously a lot of this process is automated, and will vary by provider. For example, sources closely aligned with media companies will use that media company’s listing data as a primary source.

1. Essential Tips for First Time Property Investors - Part 2
2. Tips for choosing the best investment property 

Financial independence is something we all dream about, especially in today’s often challenging and uncertain economic environment. We become financially independent when the income generated by our assets exceeds our day to day living expenses. Sadly many of us do not and will not have sufficient assets now and when we retire (for instance through our superannuation) and hence don’t or won’t have sufficient income to help provide for a decent standard of living. And so we have to go to work to earn enough money to pay our bills and hopefully have enough left over to be able to invest for our future. And until we do have sufficient income producing assets it means we are dependent on someone else, like our employer, for our financial wellbeing.

Thankfully there are strategies we can adopt that will help build these all important income earning assets and one of them is residential property investment. If done correctly property investment can provide both cash flow and capital gain thereby providing an ongoing income stream and a welcome cash lump sum when the property is eventually sold. However, if done incorrectly it can result in significant financial problems and in the worst case, financial ruin.

So to help you become a successful first time property investor, here are the first five of my top ten tips to help you along the road to financial independence:

1. Set clear financial objectives

Never invest in something just because someone said it was a good thing to do. And investing in property is no different. Take a step back and make sure you have set yourself clear financial goals. For starters, you have to define what they are and then ask yourself “will investing in residential real estate help me achieve them?” You have to set tangible targets around things like return on investment, cash flow and timeframe. You also need to consider risk and liquidity factors.

2. Treat your property investment as a business

Owning an investment property is like owning a business and you’re the CEO. You have to make sure your business is structured correctly, is supported by the right leadership, resources and technical knowledge and experience, is financially viable, is meeting its financial targets, complies with government rules and regulations and is being well run and managed. If you don’t think you can deliver on these requirements yourself than you need to hire someone who can, or think twice before investing.

3. Seek help

Before taking on what will be a big financial and emotional commitment make sure you learn about and fully understand the business of property investing. Remember a little knowledge is a dangerous thing so don’t invest if you don’t know. And if you don’t know than get advice from sources like trusted family and friends (who may have prior investing experience) and independent advisors like accountants, property advisors and financial planners. You should also read widely and follow market trends in newspapers, specialist property publications and online.

4. Research the market

As part of your education process you must research the market and get as much property data as you can, especially in the areas you are thinking of investing in. Your aim is to ensure you’re buying the right property, in the right place, at the right time and at the right price. You should register and talk with local selling agents, go online and visit property websites which often provide valuable and free suburb and property information. You can also purchase cost-effective property and investment reports from onthehouse which will help ensure you’re armed with up-to-date information on market trends and property valuations.

5. Be patient and invest sensibly

It goes without saying that buying the wrong property will deliver the wrong financial results so don’t rush. You have to balance two competing requirements – what you want and what your potential renter and (ultimately) buyer wants. So take your time and consider all options. In particular, put yourself in the shoes of a potential renter and ensure the property meets their specific needs – this includes charging affordable rent, before you buy.

"As Investors Ramp Up Activity, is Australia Becoming a Nation of Renters?
First home buyers being pushed out of the market by investors
Huge differences in affordability in Sydney & Melbourne compared to other capital cities
Strength of rental market creating opportunities for astute landlords

Australia’s property market continues to see strong growth but first home buyers are increasingly being left behind. In Sydney and Melbourne, the cost of renting is in fact less than paying off a mortgage, according to the latest analysis from Onthehouse’s property research arm, Residex.

According to the latest data, the number of first time buyers hit historical lows in December 2013, to just 7% in New South Wales, 12% in Victoria, and 12% in Queensland.

The national median value of houses and units increased in 2013 by 5.25% and 6.4% respectively. With prices going up and with affordability falling across the country, the value of loans to investors increased by 2.3% in the final quarter of 2013.

John Edwards, Consulting Analyst for Onthehouse.com.au and Founder of Residex, commented: “Investors are currently taking advantage of low interest rates, particularly older generations who are now investing in property through their self-managed super funds. People are now structuring their super fund investments in such a way that allows a form of negative gearing in residential property, allowing monthly super fund contributions from their salary to cover any rental income shortfall.

“As a result, younger buyers and those looking to buy a first home are finding it increasingly difficult to afford to purchase property, especially in Sydney and Melbourne, and are therefore having to rent.

“For landlords and investors, this essentially means a bigger pool of renters – giving an added incentive to purchase residential property.”

In regards to affordability, the proportion of income necessary for renting or buying means that for many, it costs less to rent than buy. In Sydney, buyers can expect to pay 39.39% more per month on loan repayments on a median-valued house than it would cost to rent, while in Melbourne it is 50.72% higher. The difference is far less in other capital cities.

Mr Edwards said that, although prospective younger buyers can see the cost benefits with the short term gain of renting versus buying, it should not act as a deterrent from purchasing a property.

5. Be patient and invest sensibly. Now we’ll finish off the list and look at the remaining five tips.

Capital growth is key

It might be stating the obvious but you should aim to buy where there is potential for above inflation long-term capital growth – say a minimum of 2%-3% plus CPI. This is where research, education and wisdom comes to the fore.

A sensible approach for your first investment would be to look for locations where property values have shown solid and consistent growth over the long term – and this is where talking to local estate agents and purchasing suburb property reports is invaluable. Start your search with properties within 20 - 30 kilometres from the city and major regional centres and properties with unique aspects like ocean or city views.

Property inspection is a must

The last thing you want to do is buy a lemon - something that has inherent, but perhaps not obvious defects. It’s important that you inspect a property thoroughly with an objective eye and it’s a good idea to bring family and friends along to get an unbiased perspective on what’s good and what’s not. And when you’re serious about a property, bring in the experts for a structural or pest report if you’re not sure or you want peace of mind. It’s better to pay a little more up front than a lot down the track.
